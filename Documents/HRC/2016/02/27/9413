</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL: 
INSTITUTION-BUILDING 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW MECHANISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Basis of the review 
</b></p>
<p>1. The basis of the review is: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The Charter of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Human rights instruments to which a State is party; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Voluntary pledges and commitments made by States, including those 
undertaken when presenting their candidatures for election to the Human Rights Council 
(hereinafter &#8220;the Council&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>2. In addition to the above and given the complementary and mutually interrelated 
nature of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the review 
shall take into account applicable international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Principles and objectives 
1.  Principles 
</b></p>
<p>3. The universal periodic review should: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Promote the universality, interdependence, indivisibility and interrelatedness of 
all human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Be a cooperative mechanism based on objective and reliable information and 
on interactive dialogue; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Ensure universal coverage and equal treatment of all States; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Be an intergovernmental process, United Nations Member-driven and 
action-oriented; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Fully involve the country under review; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Complement and not duplicate other human rights mechanisms, thus 
representing an added value; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Be conducted in an objective, transparent, non-selective, constructive, 
non-confrontational and non-politicized manner; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) Not be overly burdensome to the concerned State or to the agenda of the 
Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) Not be overly long; it should be realistic and not absorb a disproportionate 
amount of time, human and financial resources; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) Not diminish the Council&#8217;s capacity to respond to urgent human rights 
situations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) Fully integrate a gender perspective; 
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) Without prejudice to the obligations contained in the elements provided for in 
the basis of review, take into account the level of development and specificities of 
countries; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) Ensure the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including 
non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions, in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1996/31 of 25 July 1996, as well as any decisions that the Council may take in 
this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Objectives 
</b>4. The objectives of the review are: 
 (<i>a</i>) The improvement of the human rights situation on the ground; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The fulfilment of the State&#8217;s human rights obligations and commitments and 
assessment of positive developments and challenges faced by the State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The enhancement of the State&#8217;s capacity and of technical assistance, in 
consultation with, and with the consent of, the State concerned; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The sharing of best practice among States and other stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Support for cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The encouragement of full cooperation and engagement with the Council, other 
human rights bodies and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Periodicity and order of the review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The review begins after the adoption of the universal periodic review mechanism by 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>6. The order of review should reflect the principles of universality and equal treatment. 
</p>
<p>7. The order of the review should be established as soon as possible in order to allow 
States to prepare adequately. 
</p>
<p>8. All member States of the Council shall be reviewed during their term of membership. 
</p>
<p>9. The initial members of the Council, especially those elected for one or two-year 
terms, should be reviewed first. 
</p>
<p>10.  A mix of member and observer States of the Council should be reviewed. 
</p>
<p>11. Equitable geographic distribution should be respected in the selection of countries for 
review. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. The first member and observer States to be reviewed will be chosen by the drawing 
of lots from each Regional Group in such a way as to ensure full respect for equitable 
geographic distribution. Alphabetical order will then be applied beginning with those 
countries thus selected, unless other countries volunteer to be reviewed. 
</p>
<p>13. The period between review cycles should be reasonable so as to take into account the 
capacity of States to prepare for, and the capacity of other stakeholders to respond to, the 
requests arising from the review. 
</p>
<p>14. The periodicity of the review for the first cycle will be of four years. This will imply 
the consideration of 48 States per year during three sessions of the working group of two 
weeks each.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Process and modalities of the review 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>15. The documents on which the review would be based are: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Information prepared by the State concerned, which can take the form of a 
national report, on the basis of general guidelines to be adopted by the Council at its sixth 
session (first session of the second cycle), and any other information considered relevant 
by the State concerned, which could be presented either orally or in writing, provided that 
the written presentation summarizing the information will not exceed 20 pages, to 
guarantee equal treatment to all States and not to overburden the mechanism. States are 
encouraged to prepare the information through a broad consultation process at the national 
level with all relevant stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Additionally a compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights of the information contained in the reports of treaty bodies, special 
procedures, including observations and comments by the State concerned, and other 
relevant official United Nations documents, which shall not exceed 10 pages; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Additional, credible and reliable information provided by other relevant 
stakeholders to the universal periodic review which should also be taken into consideration 
by the Council in the review. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will 
prepare a summary of such information which shall not exceed 10 pages. 
</p>
<p>16. The documents prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
should be elaborated following the structure of the general guidelines adopted by the 
Council regarding the information prepared by the State concerned. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The universal periodic review is an evolving process; the Council, after the conclusion of the 
</p>
<p>first review cycle, may review the modalities and the periodicity of this mechanism, based on 
best practices and lessons learned. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. Both the State&#8217;s written presentation and the summaries prepared by the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights shall be ready six weeks prior to the review by the 
working group to ensure the distribution of documents simultaneously in the six official 
languages of the United Nations, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53/208 
of 14 January 1999. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Modalities 
</b></p>
<p>18. The modalities of the review shall be as follows: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The review will be conducted in one working group, chaired by the President 
of the Council and composed of the 47 member States of the Council. Each member State 
will decide on the composition of its delegation;<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Observer States may participate in the review, including in the interactive 
dialogue; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Other relevant stakeholders may attend the review in the working group; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) A group of three rapporteurs, selected by the drawing of lots among the 
members of the Council and from different Regional Groups (<i>troika</i>) will be formed to 
facilitate each review, including the preparation of the report of the working group. The 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will provide the necessary assistance 
and expertise to the rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>19. The country concerned may request that one of the rapporteurs be from its own 
Regional Group and may also request the substitution of a rapporteur on only one 
occasion. 
</p>
<p>20. A rapporteur may request to be excused from participation in a specific review 
process. 
</p>
<p>21. Interactive dialogue between the country under review and the Council will take 
place in the working group. The rapporteurs may collate issues or questions to be 
transmitted to the State under review to facilitate its preparation and focus the interactive 
dialogue, while guaranteeing fairness and transparency. 
</p>
<p>22. The duration of the review will be three hours for each country in the working group. 
Additional time of up to one hour will be allocated for the consideration of the outcome by 
the plenary of the Council. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  A Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund should be established to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>participation of developing countries, particularly the Least Developed Countries, in the 
universal periodic review mechanism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>23. Half an hour will be allocated for the adoption of the report of each country under 
review in the working group. 
</p>
<p>24.  A reasonable time frame should be allocated between the review and the adoption of 
the report of each State in the working group. 
</p>
<p>25. The final outcome will be adopted by the plenary of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Outcome of the review 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Format of the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>26. The format of the outcome of the review will be a report consisting of a summary of 
the proceedings of the review process; conclusions and/or recommendations, and the 
voluntary commitments of the State concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Content of the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>27. The universal periodic review is a cooperative mechanism. Its outcome may include, 
inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) An assessment undertaken in an objective and transparent manner of the 
human rights situation in the country under review, including positive developments and 
the challenges faced by the country; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Sharing of best practices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) An emphasis on enhancing cooperation for the promotion and protection of 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The provision of technical assistance and capacity-building in consultation 
with, and with the consent of, the country concerned;<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Voluntary commitments and pledges made by the country under review. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Adoption of the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>28. The country under review should be fully involved in the outcome. 
</p>
<p>29. Before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary of the Council, the State 
concerned should be offered the opportunity to present replies to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  A decision should be taken by the Council on whether to resort to existing financing 
</p>
<p>mechanisms or to create a new mechanism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. The State concerned and the member States of the Council, as well as observer 
States, will be given the opportunity to express their views on the outcome of the review 
before the plenary takes action on it. 
</p>
<p>31. Other relevant stakeholders will have the opportunity to make general comments 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p>32. Recommendations that enjoy the support of the State concerned will be identified as 
such. Other recommendations, together with the comments of the State concerned thereon, 
will be noted. Both will be included in the outcome report to be adopted by the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Follow-up to the review 
</b></p>
<p>33. The outcome of the universal periodic review, as a cooperative mechanism, should 
be implemented primarily by the State concerned and, as appropriate, by other relevant 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>34. The subsequent review should focus, inter alia, on the implementation of the 
preceding outcome. 
</p>
<p>35. The Council should have a standing item on its agenda devoted to the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>36. The international community will assist in implementing the recommendations and 
conclusions regarding capacity-building and technical assistance, in consultation with, and 
with the consent of, the country concerned. 
</p>
<p>37. In considering the outcome of the universal periodic review, the Council will decide 
if and when any specific follow-up is necessary. 
</p>
<p>38. After exhausting all efforts to encourage a State to cooperate with the universal 
periodic review mechanism, the Council will address, as appropriate, cases of persistent 
non-cooperation with the mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Selection and appointment of mandate-holders 
</b></p>
<p>39. The following general criteria will be of paramount importance while nominating, 
selecting and appointing mandate-holders: (a) expertise; (b) experience in the field of the 
mandate; (c) independence; (d) impartiality; (e) personal integrity; and (f) objectivity. 
</p><p>40. Due consideration should be given to gender balance and equitable geographic 
representation, as well as to an appropriate representation of different legal systems. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>41. Technical and objective requirements for eligible candidates for mandate-holders 
will be approved by the Council at its sixth session (first session of the second cycle), in 
order to ensure that eligible candidates are highly qualified individuals who possess 
established competence, relevant expertise and extensive professional experience in the 
field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>42. The following entities may nominate candidates as special procedures 
mandate-holders: (a) Governments; (b) Regional Groups operating within the 
United Nations human rights system; (c) international organizations or their offices 
(e.g. the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights); (d) non-governmental 
organizations; (e) other human rights bodies; (f) individual nominations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights shall immediately prepare, 
maintain and periodically update a public list of eligible candidates in a standardized 
format, which shall include personal data, areas of expertise and professional experience. 
Upcoming vacancies of mandates shall be publicized. 
</p>
<p>44. The principle of non-accumulation of human rights functions at a time shall be 
respected. 
</p>
<p>45. A mandate-holder&#8217;s tenure in a given function, whether a thematic or country 
mandate, will be no longer than six years<b> </b>(two terms of three years for thematic 
mandate-holders). 
</p>
<p>46. Individuals holding decision-making positions in Government or in any other 
organization or entity which may give rise to a conflict of interest with the responsibilities 
inherent to the mandate shall be excluded. Mandate-holders will act in their personal 
capacity. 
</p>
<p>47. A consultative group would be established to propose to the President, at least one 
month before the beginning of the session in which the Council would consider the 
selection<b> </b>of mandate-holders, a list of candidates who possess the highest qualifications for 
the mandates in question and meet the general criteria and particular requirements. 
</p>
<p>48. The consultative group shall also give due consideration to the exclusion of 
nominated candidates from the public list of eligible candidates brought to its attention. 
</p>
<p>49. At the beginning of the annual cycle of the Council, Regional Groups would be 
invited to appoint a member of the consultative group, who would serve in his/her personal 
capacity. The Group will be assisted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>50. The consultative group will consider candidates included in the public list; however, 
under exceptional circumstances and if a particular post justifies it, the Group may 
consider additional nominations with equal or more suitable qualifications for the post. 
Recommendations to the President shall be public and substantiated. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. The consultative group should take into account, as appropriate, the views of 
stakeholders, including the current or outgoing mandate-holders, in determining the 
necessary expertise, experience, skills, and other relevant requirements for each mandate. 
</p>
<p>52. On the basis of the recommendations of the consultative group and following broad 
consultations, in particular through the regional coordinators, the President of the Council 
will identify an appropriate candidate for each vacancy. The President will present to 
member States and observers a list of candidates to be proposed at least two weeks prior to 
the beginning of the session in which the Council will consider the appointments. 
</p>
<p>53. If necessary, the President will conduct further consultations to ensure the 
endorsement of the proposed candidates. The appointment of the special procedures 
mandate-holders will be completed upon the subsequent approval of the Council. 
Mandate-holders shall be appointed before the end of the session. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Review, rationalization and improvement of mandates 
</b></p>
<p>54. The review, rationalization and improvement of mandates, as well as the creation of 
new ones, must be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and 
non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation, with a view to 
enhancing the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p>55. The review, rationalization and improvement of each mandate would take place in 
the context of the negotiations of the relevant resolutions. An assessment of the mandate 
may take place in a separate segment of the interactive dialogue between the Council and 
special procedures mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>56. The review, rationalization and improvement of mandates would focus on 
the relevance, scope and contents of the mandates, having as a framework the 
internationally recognized human rights standards, the system of special procedures and 
General Assembly resolution 60/251. 
</p>
<p>57. Any decision to streamline, merge or possibly discontinue mandates should always 
be guided by the need for improvement of the enjoyment and protection of human rights. 
</p><p>58. The Council should always strive for improvements: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Mandates should always offer a clear prospect of an increased level of human 
rights protection and promotion as well as being coherent within the system of human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Equal attention should be paid to all human rights. The balance of thematic 
mandates should broadly reflect the accepted equal importance of civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Every effort should be made to avoid unnecessary duplication; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Areas which constitute thematic gaps will be identified and addressed, 
including by means other than the creation of special procedures mandates, such as 
by expanding an existing mandate, bringing a cross-cutting issue to the attention of 
mandate-holders or by requesting a joint action to the relevant mandate-holders; 
 (<i>e</i>) Any consideration of merging mandates should have regard to the content and 
predominant functions of each mandate, as well as to the workload of individual 
mandate-holders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) In creating or reviewing mandates, efforts should be made to identify whether 
the structure of the mechanism (expert, rapporteur or working group) is the most effective 
in terms of increasing human rights protection; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) New mandates should be as clear and specific as possible, so as to avoid 
ambiguity. 
</p>
<p>59. It should be considered desirable to have a uniform nomenclature of 
mandate-holders, titles of mandates as well as a selection and appointment process, to 
make the whole system more understandable. 
</p>
<p>60. Thematic mandate periods will be of three years. Country mandate periods will be of 
one year. 
</p>
<p>61. Mandates included in Appendix I, where applicable, will be renewed until the date 
on which they are considered by the Council according to the programme of work.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Current mandate-holders may continue serving, provided they have not exceeded the 
six-year term limit (Appendix II). On an exceptional basis, the term of those 
mandate-holders who have served more than six years may be extended until the relevant 
mandate is considered by the Council and the selection and appointment process has 
concluded. 
</p>
<p>63. Decisions to create, review or discontinue country mandates should also take into 
account the principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue aimed at strengthening the 
capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>64. In case of situations of violations of human rights or a lack of cooperation that 
require the Council&#8217;s attention, the principles of objectivity, non-selectivity, and the 
elimination of double standards and politicization should apply. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Country mandates meet the following criteria: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; There is a pending mandate of the Council to be accomplished; or 
</p>
<p>&#8722; There is a pending mandate of the General Assembly to be accomplished; or 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The nature of the mandate is for advisory services and technical assistance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee (hereinafter &#8220;the Advisory 
Committee&#8221;), composed of 18 experts serving in their personal capacity, will function as a 
think-tank for the Council and work at its direction. The establishment of this subsidiary 
body and its functioning will be executed according to the guidelines stipulated below. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Nomination 
</b></p>
<p>66. All Member States of the United Nations may propose or endorse candidates from 
their own region. When selecting their candidates, States should consult their national 
human rights institutions and civil society organizations and, in this regard, include the 
names of those supporting their candidates. 
</p>
<p>67. The aim is to ensure that the best possible expertise is made available to the Council. 
For this purpose, technical and objective requirements for the submission of candidatures 
will be established and approved by the Council at its sixth session (first session of the 
second cycle). These should include: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Recognized competence and experience in the field of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) High moral standing; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Independence and impartiality. 
</p>
<p>68. Individuals holding decision-making positions in Government or in any other 
organization or entity which might give rise to a conflict of interest with the 
responsibilities inherent in the mandate shall be excluded. Elected members of the 
Committee will act in their personal capacity. 
</p>
<p>69. The principle of non-accumulation of human rights functions at the same time shall 
be respected. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Election 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Council shall elect the members of the Advisory Committee, in secret ballot, 
from the list of candidates whose names have been presented in accordance with the agreed 
requirements. 
</p>
<p>71. The list of candidates shall be closed two months prior to the election date. The 
Secretariat will make available the list of candidates and relevant information to member 
States and to the public at least one month prior to their election. 
</p>
<p>72. Due consideration should be given to gender balance and appropriate representation 
of different civilizations and legal systems. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. The geographic distribution will be as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; African States: 5 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Asian States: 5 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Eastern European States: 2 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Latin American and Caribbean States: 3 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Western European and other States: 3 
</p>
<p>74. The members of the Advisory Committee shall serve for a period of three years. 
They shall be eligible for re-election once. In the first term, one third of the experts will 
serve for one year and another third for two years. The staggering of terms of membership 
will be defined by the drawing of lots. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Functions 
</b></p>
<p>75. The function of the Advisory Committee is to provide expertise to the Council in the 
manner and form requested by the Council, focusing mainly on studies and research-based 
advice. Further, such expertise shall be rendered only upon the latter&#8217;s request, in 
compliance with its resolutions and under its guidance. 
</p>
<p>76. The Advisory Committee should be implementation-oriented and the scope of its 
advice should be limited to thematic issues pertaining to the mandate of the Council; 
namely promotion and protection of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>77. The Advisory Committee shall not adopt resolutions or decisions. The Advisory 
Committee may propose within the scope of the work set out by the Council, for the 
latter&#8217;s consideration and approval, suggestions for further enhancing its procedural 
efficiency, as well as further research proposals within the scope of the work set out by the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>78. The Council shall issue specific guidelines for the Advisory Committee when it 
requests a substantive contribution from the latter and shall review all or any portion of 
those guidelines if it deems necessary in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Advisory Committee shall convene up to two sessions for a maximum 
of 10 working days per year. Additional sessions may be scheduled on an ad hoc basis with 
prior approval of the Council. 
</p>
<p>80. The Council may request the Advisory Committee to undertake certain tasks that 
could be performed collectively, through a smaller team or individually. The Advisory 
Committee will report on such efforts to the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>81. Members of the Advisory Committee are encouraged to communicate between 
sessions, individually or in teams. However, the Advisory Committee shall not establish 
subsidiary bodies unless the Council authorizes it to do so. 
</p>
<p>82. In the performance of its mandate, the Advisory Committee is urged to establish 
interaction with States, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations 
and other civil society entities in accordance with the modalities of the Council. 
</p>
<p>83. Member States and observers, including States that are not members of the Council, 
the specialized agencies, other intergovernmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions, as well as non-governmental organizations shall be entitled to participate in 
the work of the Advisory Committee based on arrangements, including Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1996/31 and practices observed by the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Council, while ensuring the most effective contribution of these entities. 
</p>
<p>84. The Council will decide at its sixth session (first session of its second cycle) on the 
most appropriate mechanisms to continue the work of the Working Groups on Indigenous 
Populations; Contemporary Forms of Slavery; Minorities; and the Social Forum. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  COMPLAINT PROCEDURE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Objective and scope 
</b>85. A complaint procedure is being established to address consistent patterns of gross 
and reliably attested violations of all human rights and all fundamental freedoms occurring 
in any part of the world and under any circumstances. 
</p>
<p>86. Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 27 May 1970 as revised 
by resolution 2000/3 of 19 June 2000 served as a working basis and was improved where 
necessary, so as to ensure that the complaint procedure is impartial, objective, efficient, 
victims-oriented and conducted in a timely manner. The procedure will retain its 
confidential nature, with a view to enhancing cooperation with the State concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Admissibility criteria for communications 
</b></p>
<p>87. A communication related to a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
for the purpose of this procedure, shall be admissible, provided that: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) It is not manifestly politically motivated and its object is consistent with the 
Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other 
applicable instruments in the field of human rights law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) It gives a factual description of the alleged violations, including the rights 
which are alleged to be violated; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Its language is not abusive. However, such a communication may be 
considered if it meets the other criteria for admissibility after deletion of the abusive 
language; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) It is submitted by a person or a group of persons claiming to be the victims of 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or by any person or group of 
persons, including non-governmental organizations, acting in good faith in accordance 
with the principles of human rights, not resorting to politically motivated stands contrary to 
the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and claiming to have direct and reliable 
knowledge of the violations concerned. Nonetheless, reliably attested communications 
shall not be inadmissible solely because the knowledge of the individual authors is 
second-hand, provided that they are accompanied by clear evidence; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) It is not exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) It does not refer to a case that appears to reveal a consistent pattern of gross 
and reliably attested violations of human rights already being dealt with by a special 
procedure, a treaty body or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure 
in the field of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless it appears that such remedies 
would be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged. 
</p>
<p>88. National human rights institutions, established and operating under the Principles 
Relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris Principles), in particular in regard 
to quasi-judicial competence, may serve as effective means of addressing individual human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Working groups 
</b></p>
<p>89. Two distinct working groups shall be established with the mandate to examine the 
communications and to bring to the attention of the Council consistent patterns of gross 
and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>90. Both working groups shall, to the greatest possible extent, work on the basis of 
consensus. In the absence of consensus, decisions shall be taken by simple majority of the 
votes. They may establish their own rules of procedure. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Working Group on Communications: composition,  
mandate and powers 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee shall appoint five of its members, 
one from each Regional Group, with due consideration to gender balance, to constitute the 
Working Group on Communications. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>92. In case of a vacancy, the Advisory Committee shall appoint an independent and 
highly qualified expert of the same Regional Group from the Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p>93. Since there is a need for independent expertise and continuity with regard to the 
examination and assessment of communications received, the independent and highly 
qualified experts of the Working Group on Communications shall be appointed for three 
years. Their mandate is renewable only once. 
</p>
<p>94. The Chairperson of the Working Group on Communications is requested, together 
with the secretariat, to undertake an initial screening of communications received, based 
on the admissibility criteria, before transmitting them to the States concerned. Manifestly 
ill-founded or anonymous communications shall be screened out by the Chairperson and 
shall therefore not be transmitted to the State concerned. In a perspective of accountability 
and transparency, the Chairperson of the Working Group on Communications shall provide 
all its members with a list of all communications rejected after initial screening. This list 
should indicate the grounds of all decisions resulting in the rejection of a communication. 
All other communications, which have not been screened out, shall be transmitted to the 
State concerned, so as to obtain the views of the latter on the allegations of violations. 
</p>
<p>95. The members of the Working Group on Communications shall decide on the 
admissibility of a communication and assess the merits of the allegations of violations, 
including whether the communication alone or in combination with other communications 
appear to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms. The Working Group on Communications shall provide 
the Working Group on Situations with a file containing all admissible communications as 
well as recommendations thereon. When the Working Group on Communications requires 
further consideration or additional information, it may keep a case under review until its 
next session and request such information from the State concerned. The Working Group 
on Communications may decide to dismiss a case. All decisions of the Working Group on 
Communications shall be based on a rigorous application of the admissibility criteria and 
duly justified. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Working Group on Situations: composition, mandate and powers 
</b></p>
<p>96. Each Regional Group shall appoint a representative of a member State of the 
Council, with due consideration to gender balance, to serve on the Working Group on 
Situations. Members shall be appointed for one year. Their mandate may be renewed once, 
if the State concerned is a member of the Council. 
</p>
<p>97. Members of the Working Group on Situations shall serve in their personal capacity. 
In order to fill a vacancy, the respective Regional Group to which the vacancy belongs, 
shall appoint a representative from member States of the same Regional Group. 
</p>
<p>98. The Working Group on Situations is requested, on the basis of the information and 
recommendations provided by the Working Group on Communications, to present the 
Council with a report on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms and to make recommendations to the Council on 
the course of action to take, normally in the form of a draft resolution or decision with 
respect to the situations referred to it. When the Working Group on Situations requires 
further consideration or additional information, its members may keep a case under 
review until its next session. The Working Group on Situations may also decide to dismiss 
a case. 
</p>
<p>99. All decisions of the Working Group on Situations shall be duly justified and indicate 
why the consideration of a situation has been discontinued or action recommended thereon. 
Decisions to discontinue should be taken by consensus; if that is not possible, by simple 
majority of the votes. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Working modalities and confidentiality 
</b></p>
<p>100. Since the complaint procedure is to be, inter alia, victims-oriented and conducted in a 
confidential and timely manner, both Working Groups shall meet at least twice a year for 
five working days each session, in order to promptly examine the communications 
received, including replies of States thereon, and the situations of which the Council is 
already seized under the complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p>101. The State concerned shall cooperate with the complaint procedure and make every 
effort to provide substantive replies in one of the United Nations official languages to 
any of the requests of the Working Groups or the Council. The State concerned shall also 
make every effort to provide a reply not later than three months after the request has been 
made. If necessary, this deadline may however be extended at the request of the State 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>102. The Secretariat is requested to make the confidential files available to all members of 
the Council, at least two weeks in advance, so as to allow sufficient time for the 
consideration of the files. 
</p>
<p>103. The Council shall consider consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms brought to its attention by the 
Working Group on Situations as frequently as needed, but at least once a year. 
</p>
<p>104. The reports of the Working Group on Situations referred to the Council shall be 
examined in a confidential manner, unless the Council decides otherwise. When the 
Working Group on Situations recommends to the Council that it consider a situation in a 
public meeting, in particular in the case of manifest and unequivocal lack of cooperation, 
the Council shall consider such recommendation on a priority basis at its next session. 
</p>
<p>105. So as to ensure that the complaint procedure is victims-oriented, efficient and 
conducted in a timely manner, the period of time between the transmission of the 
complaint to the State concerned and consideration by the Council shall not, in principle, 
exceed 24 months. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Involvement of the complainant and of the State concerned 
</b></p>
<p>106. The complaint procedure shall ensure that both the author of a communication and 
the State concerned are informed of the proceedings at the following key stages: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) When a communication is deemed inadmissible by the Working Group on 
Communications or when it is taken up for consideration by the Working Group on 
Situations; or when a communication is kept pending by one of the Working Groups or by 
the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) At the final outcome. 
</p>
<p>107. In addition, the complainant shall be informed when his/her communication is 
registered by the complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p>108. Should the complainant request that his/her identity be kept confidential, it will not 
be transmitted to the State concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Measures 
</b></p>
<p>109. In accordance with established practice the action taken in respect of a particular 
situation should be one of the following options: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To discontinue considering the situation when further consideration or action is 
not warranted; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To keep the situation under review and request the State concerned to provide 
further information within a reasonable period of time; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To keep the situation under review and appoint an independent and highly 
qualified expert to monitor the situation and report back to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To discontinue reviewing the matter under the confidential complaint 
procedure in order to take up public consideration of the same; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To recommend to OHCHR to provide technical cooperation, capacity-building 
assistance or advisory services to the State concerned.

<p><b>VI.  METHODS OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>110. The methods of work, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 should be 
transparent, impartial, equitable, fair, pragmatic; lead to clarity, predictability, and 
inclusiveness. They may also be updated and adjusted over time. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional arrangements 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Briefings on prospective resolutions or decisions 
</b></p>
<p>111. The briefings on prospective resolutions or decisions would be informative only, 
whereby delegations would be apprised of resolutions and/or decisions tabled or intended 
to be tabled. These briefings will be organized by interested delegations. 
</p>
<p><b>2. President&#8217;s open-ended information meetings on  
resolutions, decisions and other related business 
</b></p>
<p>112. The President&#8217;s open-ended information meetings on resolutions, decisions and other 
related business shall provide information on the status of negotiations on draft resolutions 
and/or decisions so that delegations may gain a bird&#8217;s eye view of the status of such drafts. 
The consultations shall have a purely informational function, combined with information 
on the extranet, and be held in a transparent and inclusive manner. They shall not serve as 
a negotiating forum. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Informal consultations on proposals convened by main sponsors 
</b></p>
<p>113. Informal consultations shall be the primary means for the negotiation of draft 
resolutions and/or decisions, and their convening shall be the responsibility of the 
sponsor(s). At least one informal open-ended consultation should be held on each </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>draft resolution and/or decision before it is considered for action by the Council. 
Consultations should, as much as possible, be scheduled in a timely, transparent and 
inclusive manner that takes into account the constraints faced by delegations, particularly 
smaller ones. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Role of the Bureau 
</b></p>
<p>114. The Bureau shall deal with procedural and organizational matters. The Bureau 
shall regularly communicate the contents of its meetings through a timely summary  
report. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Other work formats may include panel debates, seminars 
and round tables 
</b></p>
<p>115. Utilization of these other work formats, including topics and modalities, would be 
decided by the Council on a case-by-case basis. They may serve as tools of the Council for 
enhancing dialogue and mutual understanding on certain issues. They should be utilized in 
the context of the Council&#8217;s agenda and annual programme of work, and reinforce and/or 
complement its intergovernmental nature. They shall not be used to substitute or replace 
existing human rights mechanisms and established methods of work. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  High-Level Segment 
</b></p>
<p>116. The High-Level Segment shall be held once a year during the main session of the 
Council. It shall be followed by a general segment wherein delegations that did not 
participate in the High-Level Segment may deliver general statements. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Working culture 
</b></p>
<p>117. There is a need for: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Early notification of proposals; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Early submission of draft resolutions and decisions, preferably by the end of 
the penultimate week of a session; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Early distribution of all reports, particularly those of special procedures, to be 
transmitted to delegations in a timely fashion, at least 15 days in advance of their 
consideration by the Council, and in all official United Nations languages; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Proposers of a country resolution to have the responsibility to secure the 
broadest possible support for their initiatives (preferably 15 members), before action is 
taken; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Restraint in resorting to resolutions, in order to avoid proliferation of 
resolutions without prejudice to the right of States to decide on the periodicity of 
presenting their draft proposals by: 
</p>
<p>(i) Minimizing unnecessary duplication of initiatives with the 
General Assembly/Third Committee; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Clustering of agenda items; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Staggering the tabling of decisions and/or resolutions and consideration 
of action on agenda items/issues. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Outcomes other than resolutions and decisions 
</b></p>
<p>118. These may include recommendations, conclusions, summaries of discussions and 
President&#8217;s Statement. As such outcomes would have different legal implications, they 
should supplement and not replace resolutions and decisions. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Special sessions of the Council 
</b></p>
<p>119. The following provisions shall complement the general framework provided by 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 and the rules of procedure of the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p>120. The rules of procedure of special sessions shall be in accordance with the rules of 
procedure applicable for regular sessions of the Council. 
</p>
<p>121. The request for the holding of a special session, in accordance with the requirement

<p> (<i>e</i>) Further recognized that the promotion and protection of human rights &#8220;should be 
based on the principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the 
capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all 
human beings&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Decided that &#8220;the work of the Council shall be guided by the principles of 
universality, impartiality, objectivity, and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and 
cooperation, with a view to enhancing the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Also decided that &#8220;the methods of work of the Council shall be transparent, fair and 
impartial and shall enable genuine dialogue, be results-oriented, allow for subsequent follow-up 
discussions to recommendations and their implementation and also allow for substantive 
interaction with special procedures and mechanisms&#8221;; </p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the centrality of the notions of impartiality and objectivity, as well as the 
expertise of mandate-holders, within the context of special procedures, along with the need to 
give the required degree of attention to all human rights violations, wherever they may be taking 
place, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that the efficiency of the system of special procedures should be 
reinforced through the consolidation of the status of mandate-holders and the adoption of 
principles and regulations taking the specificities of their mandate into consideration, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that it is necessary to assist all stakeholders, including States, national human 
rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and individuals, to better understand and 
support the activities of mandate-holders, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>articles 100, 104, 105 of the Charter of the United Nations, section 22 of 
article VI of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 
13 February 1946 and paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251,

<p><i> Noting </i>decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006, in which the Council decided to extend 
exceptionally for one year the mandates and mandate-holders of the special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights, of the Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights as well as the procedure established pursuant to Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 27 May 1970, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also </i>decision 1/104 of 30 June 2006, in which the Council established the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group entrusted with the task of formulating </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommendations on the issue of the review and possibly the enhancement and rationalization of 
all mandates, mechanisms, functions and responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights, 
in order to maintain a regime of special procedures in accordance with paragraph 6 of 
General Assembly resolution 60/251, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting further </i>resolution 2/1 of 27 November 2006, in which the Council requested the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group to &#8220;draft a code of conduct regulating the work 
of the special procedures&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that this code of conduct is an integral part of the review, improvement and 
rationalization called for in General Assembly resolution 60/251 that, inter alia, seeks to enhance 
the cooperation between Governments and mandate-holders which is essential for the effective 
functioning of the system, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> <i>also </i>that such a code of conduct will strengthen the capacity of 
mandate-holders to exercise their functions whilst enhancing their moral authority and credibility 
and will require supportive action by other stakeholders, and in particular by States, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> <i>further </i>that one should distinguish between, on the one hand, the 
independence of mandate-holders, which is absolute in nature, and, on the other hand, their 
prerogatives, as circumscribed by their mandate, the mandate of the Human Rights Council, and 
the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful of the fact</i> that it is desirable to spell out, complete and increase the visibility of 
the rules and principles governing the behaviour of mandate-holders, 
</p>

than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission that was adopted by the General Assembly in 
resolution 56/280 of 27 March 2002,

<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also </i>the draft Manual of the United Nations Human Rights Special Procedures 
adopted in 1999 by the sixth annual meeting of mandate-holders, as revised, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the deliberations and proposals of the Open-ended Intergovernmental 
Working Group<b> </b>on<b> </b>Review of Mandates, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Urges<b> </b></i>all States to cooperate with, and assist, the special procedures in the

to communications transmitted to them by the special procedures without undue delay;

<p> 2. <i>Adopts</i> the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-Holders of the

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>ANNEXES 
</b></p>
<p>ANNEX I 
</p>
<p><b>Agenda 
</b></p>
<p>1. Adoption of the agenda and organization of work. 
</p>
<p>2. Implementation of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 entitled 
&#8220;Human Rights Council&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. Report to the General Assembly on the fifth session of the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>ANNEX II 
</p>
<p><b>Estimated administrative and programme budget implications 
of Council resolutions and decisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>5/1.  Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of its resolution 5/1, the Human Rights Council has adopted the text 
entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council&#8221;, annexed to the 
resolution, including its appendices and decided to submit a draft resolution to the 
General Assembly for its adoption as a matter of priority in order to facilitate the timely 
implementation of the text contained thereafter. 
</p>
<p>2. Under the terms of the text entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council&#8221;, the Council will establish a universal periodic review (UPR) mechanism, 
special procedures, a Human Rights Council Advisory Committee and a complaint procedure. 
According to that text, the operational structure and modalities of the human rights machinery 
will be established. Incremental resource requirements in respect of some of the proposals in the 
President&#8217;s text are being addressed in a separate report of the Secretary-General to the 
General Assembly on the implementation of the Human Rights Council decision 3/104, namely 
additional sessions of the Council (regular/organizational, etc.), special sessions and a high-level 
segment. Therefore, only incremental resources requirements over and above those submitted in 
connection with the decision 3/104 are included in this statement. 
</p>
<p>3. As regards the universal periodic review mechanism, the Council decides that: 
</p>
<p> (a) The review will begin after the adoption of the UPR mechanism by the Council; 
</p>
<p> (b) The periodicity of the review for the first cycle will be of four years, implying the 
consideration of 48 States per year during three sessions of the working group of two weeks 
each; 
</p>
<p> (c) A compilation of the information contained in the reports of treaty bodies and special 
procedures, including observations and comments by the State concerned, and in other relevant 
official United Nations documents, will be prepared by OHCHR. This shall not exceed 10 pages; 
</p>
<p> (d) In the review, the Council could also take into consideration additional credible and 
reliable information provided by other relevant stakeholders to the UPR. OHCHR will prepare a 
summary of such information that shall not exceed 10 pages; 
</p>
<p> (e) Each member State will decide on the composition of its delegation [to the review] 
and a UPR Voluntary Trust Fund should be established to facilitate the participation of 
developing countries, particularly LDCs, in the UPR mechanism;</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (f) A group of three rapporteurs, selected by drawing of lots among the members of the 
Council and from different Regional Groups (the &#8220;troika&#8221;), will be formed to facilitate each 
review, including the preparation of the report of the working group. OHCHR will provide the 
necessary assistance and expertise to the rapporteurs; 
</p>
<p> (g) Interactive dialogue between the country under review and the Council will take 
place in the working group. The rapporteurs may collate issues or questions to be transmitted to 
the State under review to facilitate its preparation and focus the interactive dialogue, while 
guaranteeing fairness and transparency. 
</p>
<p>4. In order to implement the above-mentioned proposals, it is estimated that the following 
additional resources will be required: 
</p>
<p>(a) Seventeen (17) new posts for OHCHR at the P-4 level to ensure the preparation of 
the relevant documents to be submitted for the review of each country during the sessions of the 
UPR working group and for support to the rapporteurs in their review and preparation of the 
report of the country group as from 2007;  
</p>
<p>(b) Conference services requirements for six weeks of meetings of the UPR working 
group starting from 2008;  
</p>
<p>(c) Information services requirements to provide for press, radio, television and 
documentation coverage as well as webcasting. 
</p>
<p>5. Total estimated resource requirements will amount to: 
</p>
<p>2006-2007 2008-2009  
United States dollars 
</p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social 
  Council affairs and conference management 
</p>
<p>- 3 847 300 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human rights - 3 139 800 
Section 27, Information Service - 353 700 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva - 323 100 
     Total  7 672 900 
</p>
<p>6. Provisions have not been made in the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009 for the above-mentioned activities, and as illustrated under paragraph 5 
above. It does not appear that it will be possible to absorb the estimated additional requirements 
within the provisions for the 2008-2009 biennium. Therefore, an additional appropriation by the 
General Assembly will be required for the biennium 2008-2009. Although it is estimated that the 
17 new P-4 posts will be required as from 2007, since it is expected that the General Assembly 
will only approve the requirements at its sixty-second session and recruitment will take several 
months, the workload will be met by use of temporary arrangements such as the use of vacant 
posts.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. As regards special procedures, the Council decides that: 
</p>
<p> (a) OHCHR shall immediately prepare, maintain and periodically update a public list of 
eligible candidates in a standardized format, which shall include personal data, areas of expertise 
and professional experience. Upcoming vacancies of mandates shall be publicized; 
</p>
<p> (b) A consultative group will be established to propose to the President a list of 
candidates who possess the highest qualifications for each mandate and meets the general criteria 
and particular requirements. The Group will be assisted by OHCHR; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Council will continue the review of mandates through an individual 
consideration of each mandate during its session of 2007/2008. With this purpose the Council 
will extend the mandates until they will be reviewed, in accordance with annex I [of the 
President&#8217;s text on institution-building]. 
</p>
<p>8. In order to implement the proposals relating to the public list and the consultative group, 
one additional new post for OHCHR at the P-3 level is required. For the biennium 2006-2007 the 
workload will be met through temporary arrangements such as the use of a vacant post for the 
reason given in paragraph 6 above. As from biennium 2008-2009, it is proposed that a new post 
be established at the P-3 level to implement the terms of the President&#8217;s statement. 
</p>
<p>9. Total estimated resource requirements will amount to: 
</p>
<p>2006-2007 2008-2009  
United States dollars 
</p>
<p>Section 23,  Human rights - 156 200 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva - 17 400 
     Total  173 600 
</p>
<p>10. Provision has not been made in the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009 for the above-mentioned activities, as illustrated under paragraph 9 above. 
It does not appear that it will be possible to absorb the estimated additional requirements of 
$151,200 within the provisions for the 2008-2009 biennium. Therefore, an additional 
appropriation by the General Assembly will be required for the biennium 2008-2009. 
</p>
<p>11. As regards the extension of existing special mandates, related provisions have been 
included under Section 23, Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 
and requested under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. 
</p>
<p>12. The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee will replace the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The Council will decide that the Advisory 
Committee shall convene up to two sessions for a maximum of 10 working days per year. 
Additional sessions may be scheduled on an ad hoc basis with prior approval of the Council. 
</p>
<p>13. In order to implement the above-mentioned proposals, resources of US$ 710,600 for travel 
and daily subsistence allowance (DSA) for 18 Committee members attending two sessions 
annually will be needed under Section 23, Human rights, starting from the biennium 2008-2009.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. Provisions for travel and DSA on a maintenance basis for the former Sub-Commission 
and its working groups have been requested under the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009.  
</p>
<p>15. Requirements for conference servicing of two sessions of the Advisory Committee of five 
days duration each required under Sections 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social 
Council affairs and conference management and 28E, Administration, Geneva, will be covered 
within the resources approved for the former Sub-Commission (three weeks per year). The 
resulting one-week saving in conference servicing requirements vis-&#224;-vis the existing provisions 
for the Sub-Commission will be used to offset requirements for an additional week of meetings 
of the Working Group on Situations under the Complaint Procedure (see paragraph 18 below). 
</p>
<p>16. Resource requirements for travel, DSA and conference services relating to the working 
groups of the former Sub-Commission will be determined in connection with the Council&#8217;s 
review of their status at its sixth session. 
</p>
<p>17. The complaint procedure will replace the former 1503 procedure. The Council decides 
that: 
</p>
<p> (a) Two distinct Working Groups shall be established with the mandate to examine the 
communications and to bring to the attention of the Human Rights Council consistent patterns of 
gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee shall appoint five of its members, 
one from each Regional Group, with due consideration to gender balance, to constitute the 
Working Group on Communications;  
</p>
<p> (c) Each Regional Group shall appoint a representative of a member State of the 
Council, with due consideration to gender balance, to serve on the Working Group on Situations;  
</p>
<p> (d) Both Working Groups shall meet at least twice a year for five working days each 
session. 
</p>
<p>18. In order to implement the above-mentioned proposals, conference servicing resources 
starting in the biennium 2008-2009 will be required for two five-day sessions per year for both 
the Working Group on Communications and the Working Group on Situations. 
</p>
<p>19. Provisions for two weeks of meetings for the Working Group on Communications and one 
week for the Working Group on Situations under the former Commission and Sub-Commission 
mandates have been included in the 2006-2007 budget and were also requested under the 
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. The additional week of meetings for 
the Working Group on Situations will be offset against savings from the reduction of meetings of 
the former Sub-Commission by one week. Thus, no additional resources will be required. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. In summary, should the Council adopt the proposed resolution, the following additional 
resources will be required by budget section: 
</p>
<p>2006-2007 2008-2009  
United States dollars 
</p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social 
  Council affairs and conference management 
</p>
<p>- 3 847 300 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human rights - 3 296 000 
Section 27, Information Service      353 700 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva    349 500 
     Total  7 846 500 
</p>
<p>21. The Secretary-General notes that the Council is expected to continue its review in 
September 2007 of the existing special mandates through 2007/2008. Accordingly, it may also 
be noted that the submission of related estimated additional requirements of US$ 7,846,500 will 
be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session by which time the Council is 
expected to have concluded its revision of such mandates. The Secretariat will then be in a better 
position to determine the totality of resources required to implement recent Human Rights 
Council decisions. </p>
