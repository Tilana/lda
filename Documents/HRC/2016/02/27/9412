<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is being submitted pursuant to a request made by the Intergovernmental 
Working Group on the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action at its fourth session (Geneva 16 - 20 January 2006). The request was endorsed by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolution 1/5 of 30 June 2006. 
</p>
<p> The introduction to the report provides an overview of the background to the establishment 
of the group of experts. The mandate of the experts to study &#8220;the content and scope of the 
substantive gaps in the existing international instruments to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221; and to &#8220;produce &#8230; concrete recommendations on the means 
or avenues to bridge these gaps&#8221; is also discussed. As to the methodology of the study, the 
experts reached agreement regarding the meaning which is to be attached to the concepts of 
racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and related intolerance and the notion of 
substantive normative gaps. The introduction also covers measures to address substantive 
normative gaps and the process and structure of the study. 
</p>
<p> The body of the report dealing with complementary international standards is divided into 
three chapters as follows: chapter I concerns the positive obligations of States parties; chapter II 
examines possible gaps with regard to groups requiring special protection against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; and chapter III addresses possible gaps with 
regard to manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> In chapter I the experts focus on normative gaps concerning norms which set out (a) the 
obligations of States to promote tolerance and (b) the obligations of States to adopt national 
anti-discrimination legislation. In chapter II, the experts consider the following categories as 
formulated by the Chair of the Working Group at its fourth session: (a) religious groups; 
(b) refugees; (c) asylum-seekers; (d) stateless persons; (e) migrant workers; (f) internally 
displaced persons; (g) descent-based communities; (h) indigenous peoples; (i) minorities; 
and (j) people under foreign occupation. 
 In chapter III, the experts consider the following phenomena as formulated by the Chair of 
the Working Group: (a)<b> </b>multiple discrimination or aggravated forms of racial discrimination; 
(b) ethnic cleansing; (c) genocide; (d) religious intolerance and defamation of religious symbols; 
(e) racial discrimination in the private sphere; and (f) incitement to racial hatred and 
dissemination of hate speech and xenophobic and caricatural pictures, through traditional mass 
media and information technology, including the Internet. 
</p>
<p> The experts provide an assessment and recommendations at the end of each thematic 
section. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b>Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that:  
&#8220;Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this  
Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex,  
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin,  
                                property, birth or other status.&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Establishment of the Group of experts 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (DDPA) adopted in 2001 at the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance 
considered the need to expand the human rights normative framework to appropriately cover 
manifestations of racism and xenophobia. In this context, the DDPA recommended &#8220;that the 
Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international standards to strengthen 
and update international instruments against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance in all their aspects.&#8221;<b>1</b> In its resolution 2002/68 the Commission entrusted 
this task to the Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (Intergovernmental Working Group). 
</p>
<p>2. The Intergovernmental Working Group at its fourth session held a high level seminar on 
complementary international standards which further informed the Group as to areas where there 
may be a need for complementary standards. It is in this context that the Intergovernmental 
Working Group requested the Human Rights Council to establish a group of experts to prepare a 
base document that would contain concrete recommendations on the means or avenues to bridge 
gaps in the existing international instruments to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; and for the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD) to prepare a base document on the procedural aspects of the issue. 
Both documents are to be submitted to the fifth session of the Working Group.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>3. Following the request of the Intergovernmental Working Group, the Human Rights 
Council (HRC) in its resolution 1/5 adopted on 30 June 2006 decided to establish the group 
of experts. To that end, the resolution recommended that the Group of experts carry out 
consultations with human rights treaty bodies, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and other relevant 
mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>4. Consistent with resolution 1/5, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
in consultation with the regional groups, invited the following experts to conduct the study: 
Mr. Syafi&#8217;i Anwar (Indonesia, Group of Asian States), Ms. Jenny Goldschmidt (the Netherlands,

African States); Ms. Dimitrina Petrova (Bulgaria, Group of Eastern European States); and 
Mr. Waldo Luis Villalpando (Argentina , Group of Latin American and Caribbean States). 
</p>
<p><b>Methodology of the study 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Definition of the concepts of racism, racial discrimination  
and xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>5. The notions of racism and xenophobia are well established. For the purpose of this report, 
the experts will rely on the DDPA which states inter alia that: &#8220;We recognize that racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent 
or national or ethnic origin and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination based on other related grounds such as sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, social origin, property, birth or other status.&#8221;<b>3</b> It is also to be noted that the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD)<b>4</b> defines the term 
racial discrimination as &#8220;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, 
colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or 
impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public 
life.&#8221;<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The term xenophobia is understood as a type of prejudice combined with a negative 
sentiment towards persons perceived as alien and different in a significant way. The term related 
intolerance is understood as any intolerance connected in some way with racism and racial 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The notion of substantive normative gaps 
</b></p>
<p>7. A normative gap exists when a recurring event (or act or structural factor) deprives human 
beings of their dignity and is not effectively countered by a normative standard. In such a case, a 
new or more comprehensive provision or instrument may be the necessary step to redress this 
situation.<b>6</b> A normative gap may occur as a consequence of one of the two following situations: 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Para. 2 Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Adopted in 1965, ICERD entered into force on 4 January 1969. As of 13 December 2005, 
</p>
<p>170 States had ratified the treaty, making it one of the most widely ratified human rights treaties. 
The ICERD provisions remain the most important normative basis upon which international 
efforts to eliminate racial discrimination should rely.

</p>
<p>Commission of Jurists and International Service for Human Rights, <i>Human Rights Standards: 
Learning from Experience</i>, 2006, p. 7-10. The experts&#8217; classification of gaps is based on this 
publication. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate norms addressing a given phenomenon, in general - a normative gap 
proper - and/or absence of an instrument, enabling the application of existing standards to a 
given category/ies of subjects and/or specific circumstances. Such a normative gap is in the 
application. 
</p>
<p>8. In identifying normative gaps, the experts noted that a gap exists not only when there is a 
complete absence of norms addressing the problem. A gap can also be identified when a standard 
does not provide sufficient specificity so as to impose clear obligations on the duty-bearers, 
thereby rendering effective protection of rights illusory. 
</p>
<p>9. The distinction between &#8220;normative gap proper&#8221; and &#8220;application gap&#8221; is helpful in 
the consideration of recommended measures to be taken to fill a gap. While in the first 
case, setting or developing a standard to address a specific phenomenon may be the 
best solution; in the second, the extension of the application of an existing standard may be 
sufficient. 
</p>
<p>10. Normative gaps can further be divided into substantive and procedural (supervisory) gaps, 
depending on whether the gap in question relates to the content of a right or the procedure of its 
protection. A procedural gap exists when a right has been included in an instrument, but no 
mechanism exists to monitor and enforce compliance thereto, or the mechanism is insufficient to 
ensure compliance or provide remedy to victims. 
</p>
<p>11. The experts understand their mandate as focusing on studying substantive normative gaps, 
while procedural (supervisory) gaps are being addressed in a parallel study by the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 
</p>
<p>12. The diagnosis of gaps is based on analysis of international human rights law and current 
facts. Bearing in mind the impact of implementation gaps on the functional assessment of the 
existing legal framework, the experts recognized certain findings concerning implementation 
gaps as an integral part of their analysis and assessments. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Measures to address substantive normative gaps 
</b></p>
<p>13. Practical steps that may be considered to fill the gaps are the following: (a) new standard 
setting - in the form of a separate convention and/or optional protocol/s to the existing ones; 
and (b) standard development through extended application of the existing standards as to the 
substance or circle of addressees, including by the following means: (i) authentic interpretation 
of the existing treaty norms by States parties, (ii) general comments by treaty bodies, adopted by 
human rights treaty bodies individually or jointly; (iii) incorporation of the extended 
interpretation into the reporting guidelines adopted by human rights treaty bodies; 
and (iv) incorporation of the extended interpretation into the rules of procedure adopted by 
human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>14. The experts recognize the need to correlate the recommended measures with the nature of 
the normative gaps that have been identified. While analyzing specific gaps, they have been 
guided by the extent to which the proposed measure/s can improve the situation of victims of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>discrimination and/or counter or deter manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and by the consideration of not undermining current 
international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>The study process 
</b></p>
<p>15. The assessment leading to the identification of substantive normative gaps and the 
recommendations regarding measures to be taken to fill these gaps rely on a variety of sources, 
including (a) international human rights instruments and treaties, general comments and 
recommendations, as well as other relevant documents adopted by human rights treaty bodies, 
(b) comparative legal and quasi-legal materials both universal and regional (e.g. resolutions of 
intergovernmental bodies), (c) basic policy documents, such as the DDPA, the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome, the conclusions and recommendations of the Intergovernmental Working 
Group and the other Durban mechanisms, and (d) selected professional publications. 
</p>
<p>16. The experts carried out extensive consultations on the subject. To that end, they adopted a 
questionnaire, annex to this report, to solicit views and comments from various stakeholders. 
The questionnaire was sent to all relevant actors, and posted on the Internet site established by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and made 
accessible to the general public. 
</p>
<p>17. Oral consultations were also held. The organs, bodies and individuals consulted included: 
(a) the human rights treaty bodies, in particular the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination; (b) special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council (HRC), in 
particular the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; (c) the Intergovernmental Working Group; 
(d) intergovernmental regional groups; (e) individual Governments, (f) non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs); and (g) experts from OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>The structure of the study 
</b></p>
<p>18. In conducting the study the experts were guided by the conclusions formulated by the 
Chair of the Intergovernmental Working Group at its fourth session which list (a) manifestations 
of racism and xenophobia and (b) protection of victims or groups and persons at risk.<b>7</b> In 
addition, the experts identified other subjects for inclusion in their study, in particular promotion 
of tolerance and specific obligations of States. The experts agreed on the subjects to be included 
in the study and adopted their recommendations by consensus.<b> </b> However, the experts did not 
reach consensus on the inclusion of any discussion and/or reference to sexual orientation in 
relation to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the study. 
Mr. Anwar specifically requested that his dissenting position on this matter be recorded. 
</p>
<p>19. Under manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
the experts considered the following phenomena, as formulated by the Chair of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group: (a) multiple or aggravated forms of racial discrimination; 
                                                 
</p>

</p>
<p>(b) ethnic cleansing; (c) genocide; (d) religious intolerance and defamation of religious symbols; 
(e) racial discrimination in the private sphere; and (f) incitement to racial hatred and 
dissemination of hate speech and xenophobic and caricatural pictures, through traditional mass 
media and information technology, including the Internet. 
</p>
<p>20. Under protection against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, the experts considered the following categories, as formulated by the 
Chair of the Intergovernmental Working Group: (a) religious groups; (b) refugees; 
(c) asylum-seekers; (d) stateless persons; (e) migrant workers; (f) internally displaced persons; 
(g) descent-based communities; (h) indigenous peoples; (i) minorities; and (j) people under 
foreign occupation. 
</p>
<p>21. The experts also decided to include a third thematic area in the study, namely positive 
obligations of States. In this part the experts focussed on normative gaps regarding 
(a) obligations of States to promote tolerance; and (b) obligations of States to adopt national 
anti-discrimination legislation. 
</p>
<p>22. In light of the above, the experts agreed on a set of recommendations which mark the 
conclusion of each area examined. In this endeavour, the experts were guided by the following 
considerations: 
</p>
<p> (a) Overall, the experts believe that enhanced coherence in the anti-racism comments 
and recommendations issued by the treaty bodies in the field of equality and combating racial 
discrimination would contribute to consistency in implementation at the national level and serve 
to facilitate the tasks of States parties concerned in developing legislation, policies and 
programmes; 
</p>
<p> (b) The incorporation of the DDPA recommendations and those issued by the Durban 
mechanisms and ICERD into domestic constitutional and legal systems, policies and 
programmes would enhance the ability of individuals to assert and claim their rights to equality 
and non-discrimination and help alleviate the scourge of racism. The experts encourage training 
and the holding of workshops at the national level as part of Durban follow-up activities to 
enhance the implementation of the Durban Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p><b>I. COMPLEMENTARY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WITH REGARD 
TO POSITIVE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES PARTIES 
</b></p>
<p>23. The notion of positive obligations with regard to human rights denotes those obligations 
that impose upon the State a duty to undertake some positive action in order to ensure the 
effective enjoyment of the protected rights. A significant number of human rights norms entail 
positive obligations for the States bound by them.<b>8</b> For instance, with regard to the positive 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general 
</p>
<p>legal obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant, paras. 6, 7 and 8. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>obligation to protect the right to non-discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), article 26 requires States to &#8220;guarantee to all persons equal and 
effective protection against discrimination.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>24. Article 2(1) (d) of ICERD requires States to prohibit and bring to an end &#8220;racial 
discrimination by any persons, group or organisation.&#8221;<b>9</b> In its general comment No. 3 (1981) on 
article 2 (Implementation at the national level) of the ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee 
&#8220;recognizes, in particular, that the implementation does not depend solely on constitutional or 
legislative enactments, which in themselves are often not per se sufficient. The Committee 
considers it necessary to draw the attention of States parties to the fact that the obligation under 
the Covenant is not confined to the respect of human rights, but that States parties have also 
undertaken to ensure the enjoyment of these rights to all individuals under their jurisdiction. This 
aspect calls for specific activities by the States parties to enable individuals to enjoy their 
rights.&#8221;<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations under article 2 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) considers that States&#8217; &#8220;obligations include both what may 
be termed (following the work of the International Law Commission) obligations of conduct and 
obligations of result &#8230; while the Covenant provides for progressive realization and 
acknowledges the constraints due to the limits of available resources, it also imposes various 
obligations which are of immediate effect. Of these, two are of particular importance in 
understanding the precise nature of States parties&#8217; obligations. One of these, which is dealt with 
in a separate general comment, and which is to be considered by the Committee at its sixth 
session, is the &#8216;undertaking to guarantee&#8217; that relevant rights &#8216;will be exercised without 
discrimination ...&#8217;&#8221;.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>26. CESCR general comment No. 16 (2005) on the equal right of men and women to the 
enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights (art. 3), interprets article 2, paragraph 2 of 
ICESCR, which provides for a guarantee of non-discrimination on the basis of sex among other 
grounds. Here, the Committee asserts that the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of

Rights of the Child (CRC) art. 2, paras. 1 and 2; International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) art. 7; and

</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights is a mandatory and immediate obligation of States parties. 
Similarly to all human rights, equality of rights imposes three levels of obligations on States 
parties - &#8220;the obligation to respect, to protect and to fulfil&#8221;.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>27. According to CESCR, the obligation to fulfil requires States parties to take steps to ensure 
that in practice, men and women enjoy their economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of 
equality.<b>13</b> The obligation to respect requires States parties to refrain from discriminatory actions 
that directly or indirectly result in the denial of the equal right of men and women to their 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.<b>14</b> The obligation to protect requires States 
parties to take steps aimed directly at the elimination of prejudices, customary and all other 
practices that perpetuate the notion of inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes, and 
stereotyped roles for men and women.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The experts believe that progress in ensuring protection against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance is hampered by the lack at present of legally 
binding norms which impose on States the obligation to introduce mandatory human rights 
education in their educational systems. Further, the provisions which require that States adopt 
anti-discrimination legislation are often too general and abstract, leaving States without guidance 
as to minimum legal standards to be met in their domestic laws, in the absence of which 
protection against racial discrimination may be rendered illusory. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The role of human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>29. The DDPA underlines the importance of human rights education as a key to changing 
attitudes and behaviour and to promoting tolerance and respect for diversity in societies<b>16</b> and, 
therefore as crucial in the struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance.<b>17</b> The importance of human rights education is also underlined in several other 
human rights documents. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action assert that &#8220;human 
rights education, training and public information are essential for the promotion and achievement

<p>tolerance and peace.&#8221;<b>18</b> The World Programme for Human Rights Education identifies the 
promotion of understanding, tolerance, gender equality and friendship among all nations, 
indigenous peoples and racial, national, ethnic, religious and linguistic groups as one of the 
constitutive elements of human rights education that aims at building a universal culture of 
human rights.<b>19</b> The 2005 World Summit Outcome calls for the implementation of the World 
Programme for Human Rights Education and encourages all States to develop initiatives in this 
regard.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>30. ICERD commits States parties &#8220;to undertake to adopt immediate and effective measures, 
particularly in the fields of teaching, education, culture and information, with a view to 
combating prejudices which lead to racial discrimination and to promoting understanding, 
tolerance and friendship among nations and racial or ethnical groups.&#8221;<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Human rights treaty bodies dedicate much attention to the role of education in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. In its general recommendation No. 27 (2000) on 
discrimination against Roma, CERD recommended that States parties take &#8220;the necessary 
measures, in cooperation with civil society, and initiate projects to develop the political culture 
and educate the population as a whole in a spirit of non-discrimination, respect for others and 
tolerance, in particular concerning Roma.&#8221;<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The World Programme for Human Rights Education provides a common framework for 
action for all relevant actors. However, it is not a legally binding document. In the view of the 
experts, the adoption of a comprehensive binding instrument establishing the duty to promote 
non-discrimination, tolerance and equality of rights irrespective of race, ethnicity, and other 
related grounds through human rights education has important merit. Such an instrument would 
essentially contribute to the promotion of tolerance and the countering of racism and xenophobia 
through instruction at all levels of formal and informal education, in public and private school 
curricula, as well as schools the ethos of which is based on religion or belief. This goal should 
also be pursued in other educational frameworks, such as training in detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>33. In conclusion, the experts acknowledge the existence of a normative gap in the area under 
discussion, the filling of which should be recognized as one of the priorities on the agenda of the 
international community.

<p><b>2.  The role of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation 
</b></p>
<p>34. The DDPA identifies lack of political will, weak legislation and lack of implementation 
strategies and overall concrete action by States as the major obstacles to overcoming racial 
discrimination and achieving racial equality. The DDPA stresses unequivocally that the faithful 
implementation of human rights norms and obligations, including enactment of laws and 
political, social and economic policies are crucial in this regard.<b>23</b> It is in light of the nature of 
these obstacles that States should be specifically required to adopt and implement 
anti-discrimination legislation and equality policies as a matter of highest priority and urgency. 
</p>
<p>35. Several treaties, including ICCPR and ICERD contain provisions with positive obligations 
to adopt laws against racial and related discrimination. ICCPR in article 2, paragraph 1, requires 
States to ensure to all persons within its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the Covenant 
without distinction of any kind. Article 2, paragraph 2, requires, &#8220;where not already provided for 
by existing legislative or other measures&#8221;, the necessary steps to be undertaken &#8220;to adopt such 
laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present 
Covenant.&#8221; Read together with ICCPR articles 26 and 27, this provision constitutes a positive 
obligation of States to put into place domestic laws as necessary to ensure freedom from 
discrimination on the basis of, inter alia, race, colour, national or social origin. Article 2, 
paragraph 1 (d) of ICERD also provides that &#8220;Each State party shall prohibit and bring to an end, 
by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by circumstances, racial 
discrimination by any persons, group or organization.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>36. Apart from the positive obligation of States to protect against racial discrimination the 
question arises as to whether ICERD and other international human rights instruments provide a 
sufficiently firm foundation for the positive obligation of States parties to adopt not just any 
general legal provisions prohibiting racial discrimination, but comprehensive anti-discrimination 
legislation. In addition, it is important to consider the minimum standards which are to be met 
for the State to have the appropriate legal regime to ensure and fulfil Convention rights regarding 
the equal enjoyment of all human rights by all without any discrimination on the basis of race. 
</p><p>37. CERD in its concluding observations frequently recommends to States parties to adopt 
national anti-discrimination legislation, in fulfilling their obligations under the Convention. 
However, the analysis of the experts as regards discriminatory practices and the situation of 
various categories of victims demonstrate that among the obstacles preventing the elimination of 
all forms of racial discrimination is the lack of comprehensive and detailed national 
anti-discrimination legislation in the majority of States parties to this Convention. 
38. From the general comments, the case law and the concluding observations of treaty bodies 
we can garner the following minimum requirements which would make national legislation

</p>
<p>efficient: provide legal definitions of the concept of discrimination, including direct and indirect 
discrimination;<b>24</b> set out clear and detailed provisions as to what conduct, actions, measures, 
policies, or criteria would be considered discriminatory; provide for a substantive, asymmetric 
approach to non-discrimination, as opposed to a merely formal understanding of 
non-discrimination as &#8220;same treatment&#8221;; prohibit discrimination in all spheres of public life 
whether by State or non-State actors; prohibit incitement to discrimination, harassment, and 
segregation; incorporate specialized bodies which would be empowered to assist victims and to 
promote a culture of equal rights; provide for effective judicial remedy, including as necessary 
through criminal, civil or administrative processes, to victims of discrimination and ensure that 
sanctions in place are efficient, dissuasive and proportional; allow the procedural possibility for 
proving discrimination through appropriate rules and criteria of evidence and burdens of proof, 
deriving from the understanding that the victims of discrimination are usually at a disadvantage 
and would not be able to defend their rights in the courts unless special care is taken as to their 
procedural rights; and establish clear obligations related to the duty to promote equality in a 
proactive way through appropriate policies. 
</p>
<p>39. The experts believe that there exists a gap in the sense that thin and abstract norms in 
international human rights instruments can perpetuate a normative vacuum at the national level, 
leaving certain manifestations of racism unaddressed and certain victims unprotected, especially 
when the lack of explicit obligatory standards is combined with weak political will of the State to 
ensure and fulfil Convention rights. However, the experts also believe that these problems could 
be addressed by rendering the positive obligations of States more explicit through means other 
than standard-setting. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>The experts recommend that a convention on human rights education be adopted, 
to define positive obligations of States regarding the incorporation of human 
rights education in their educational systems, including in private, religious, and military 
schools. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The experts recommend that the treaty bodies consider adopting general 
comments which would clarify the positive obligations of States parties regarding the 
adoption of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and provide relevant guidance 
for States. 
</b></p>
<p>

<p><b>24
</b>  Direct discrimination on the basis of race and related characteristics is defined as less 
</p>
<p>favourable treatment based wholly or in part on the person&#8217;s race, ethnicity, colour, descent, 
ethnic or national origin, without objective and reasonable justification. Indirect discrimination is 
defined as a neutral measure, criterion or practice which would put persons of a particular race or 
related characteristic at a particular disadvantage, when there is no objective and reasonable 
justification. </p>

<p><b>II. COMPLEMENTARY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS  
WITH REGARD TO GROUPS REQUIRING SPECIAL  
PROTECTION AGAINST RACISM, RACIAL,  
DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA 
AND RELATED INTOLERANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Religious groups 
</b></p>
<p>42. International concern raised by the recent increase in violence and discrimination based on 
religion or belief in many countries is justified. It is also a contemporary phenomenon that 
discrimination on various grounds such as race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin is 
frequently aggravated by the closely related ground of religion or belief. The Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action (DDPA) notes with particular concern &#8220;the existence in various parts 
of the world of religious intolerance against religious communities and their members, in 
particular limitation of their right to practice their beliefs freely, as well as the emergence of 
increased negative stereotyping, hostile acts and violence against such communities because of 
their religious beliefs and their ethnic or so-called racial origin.&#8221;<b>25</b> The DDPA urges States to 
adopt legislative and other measures to protect religious minorities from any form of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.<b>26</b> It also calls on States to implement 
policies and programmes in their educational institutions that promote respect and tolerance for 
religious diversity as human rights education is an effective means for combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Under international law, the right to freedom of religion, which includes &#8220;freedom to 
change his religion or belief&#8221; and freedom &#8220;to manifest his religion or belief&#8221;, was first 
articulated in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With regard to the core 
human right treaties, freedom of religion is primarily guaranteed under the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Proclaimed under article 18 of ICCPR, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which 
includes freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of one&#8217;s choice, and freedom, either 
individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one&#8217;s religion or 
belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching religion, is a non-derogable right even in

<p>time of public emergency.<b>29</b> Consequently, in the view of the Human Rights Committee, 
freedom from coercion to have or to adopt a religion or belief and the freedom of parents and 
guardians to ensure religious and moral education cannot be restricted.<b>30</b> The Committee also 
points out that article 18 of ICCPR protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as 
the right not to profess any religion or belief. The terms belief and religion are to be broadly 
construed and article 18 is not limited to traditional religions or to religions and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>45. The Covenant permits, however, limitations on the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or 
beliefs &#8220;as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or 
morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&#8221;<b>31</b> In the view of the Human Rights 
Committee, States parties are not free to establish limitations on the exercise of rights and 
freedoms: &#8220;Limitations imposed must be established by law and must not be applied in a manner 
that would vitiate the rights guaranteed in article 18.&#8221;<b>32</b> The Committee also emphasizes that no 
manifestation of religion or belief may amount to propaganda for war or advocacy of national, 
racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
</p>
<p>46. In addition, article 26 of the Covenant guarantees equality before the law and the equal 
protection of the law. It establishes the obligation of States parties to prohibit any discrimination 
and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground, 
including race and religion. Article 27 of ICCPR provides for the rights of members of religious 
minorities by ensuring their right &#8220;to profess and practice their own religion&#8221;.<b>33</b> Other core 
human rights treaties indicate both race and religion as prohibited grounds for any differentiation 
between people as far as their human rights are concerned.<b>34</b> Although the definition of the racial 
discrimination formulated in article 1, paragraph 1 of ICERD does not encompass religion, it is 
listed under article 5, paragraph (d) (vii). ICESCR identifies education as a tool for the 
promotion of &#8220;understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations and all racial, ethnic or 
religious groups.&#8221;<b>35</b>

</p>
<p>47. The 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief defines intolerance and discrimination in this context 
as &#8220;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on religion or belief and having as 
its purpose or as its effect nullification or impairment of the recognition, enjoyment or exercise 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis.&#8221; Human rights bodies and 
Governments should rely on the provisions thereof. Article 2 of the Declaration underlines that 
&#8220;no one shall be subject to discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons, or person 
on the grounds of religion or other belief&#8221; and article 4 calls on States to take effective measures 
and &#8220;make all efforts&#8221; to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or 
belief. According to the 1992 Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or 
Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities &#8220;States shall take measures to create favourable 
conditions to enable persons belonging to minorities to express their characteristics and to 
develop their culture, language, religion, traditions and customs ...&#8221;.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>48. The nexus between racism and religion poses complex and sensitive issues which are not 
adequately addressed under international law. The experts believe that the reference to the right 
to freedom of religion in article 5, paragraph (d) (vii) of ICERD should be further developed to 
cover the complexity of the connection between religion and race, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. In light of the increasing incidents of Islamophobia, 
anti-Semitism and Christianophobia in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, it is 
necessary that human rights bodies update accordingly their general comments or 
recommendations, reporting guidelines, and rules of procedures. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>It is recommended in particular that CERD adopt a general recommendation 
addressing concerns which have emerged in the area of racial discrimination and religion 
or belief. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>In addition, the experts recommend that the Human Rights Committee revise general 
comment No. 22 (1993) on article 18 (Freedom of thought, conscience or religion) in order 
to address present challenges. The experts stress that in addressing problems linked to the 
nexus between racism and religious, it is vital that human rights bodies and Governments 
rely on the provisions of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of</b> <b>All forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Refugees, asylum-seekers, migrant workers and stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Refugees, asylum-seekers, migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>51. There is an intrinsic connection between racism and the situation of refugees, 
asylum-seekers and migrants. Racism, sometimes accompanied with violence, continues to be

</b>  Article 4, para. 2. </p>

</p>
<p>responsible for the flight of hundreds of thousands of people from their countries. Subsequently, 
such people very often become targets of racism and violence in the host countries where they 
have been forced to seek sanctuary. There is a lot of documented evidence for this. 
</p>
<p>52. The DDPA calls on the international community, Governments, NGOs and the private 
sector to undertake specific action to address problems associated with the vulnerability of 
persons falling into the aforementioned categories and to identify prompt and adequate solutions 
to ensure their protection.<b>37</b> The DDPA also underlines the urgency of addressing the root causes 
of displacement and reiterates that the international response and policy towards refugees should 
be free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin of 
the refugees concerned.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>53. ICERD does not specifically refer to the status of refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrant 
workers. However, the general provisions of this Convention and other core human rights 
treaties prohibiting discrimination are also applicable to these categories of persons.<b>39</b> Several 
treaty bodies have addressed this issue in their general comments. 
</p>
<p>54. CERD in its general recommendation No. 22 (1996) on article 5 of the Convention on 
refugees and displaced persons recalled that the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating 
to the Status of Refugees are the main sources of the international system for the protection of 
refugees in general; and emphasized, inter alia, that: &#8220;All refugees and displaced persons have 
the right to return to their homes of origin under conditions of safety&#8221; and that &#8220;States parties are 
obliged to ensure that the return of such refugees and displaced persons is voluntary and to 
observe the principle of non-refoulement and non-expulsion of refugees.&#8221;<b>40</b> CERD general 
recommendation No. 30 (2005) on discrimination against non-citizens also includes these 
groups. 
</p>
<p>55. In its general comment No. 13 (1999) on the right to education (art. 13), CESCR states that 
&#8220;the principle of non-discrimination extends to all persons of school age residing in the territory 
of a State party, including non-nationals, and irrespective of their legal status.&#8221;<b>41</b>

</p>
<p>56. In its general recommendation No. 24 (1999) on article 12 of the Convention (women and 
health), the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women urges States to pay 
special attention &#8220;to the health needs and rights of women belonging to vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups, such as migrant women, refugee and internally displaced women, the girl 
child and older women, women in prostitution, indigenous women &#8230;.&#8221;<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Several other international instruments are of great relevance in this context. In particular, 
attention should be paid to the: International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW); Convention relating to the Status 
of Refugees of 1951, and its 1967 Protocol; the relevant ILO Conventions; Convention for the 
Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others 
of 1949; United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and the 
Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the 
Convention; Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of 1954; Convention on the 
Reduction of Statelessness of 1961; and Declaration on the Human Rights of Individuals Who 
are not Nationals of the Country in which they Live of 1985. The experts are seriously concerned 
by the exceptionally low rate of ratification of the ICRMW. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>58. The experts do not discern any substantive gaps as regards the protection of refugees, 
asylum-seekers and migrant workers from racism and racial discrimination. States parties should, 
however, be enjoined to take the necessary legislative and administrative measures to implement 
their obligations arising from ICERD with respect to these specific categories as well as from 
other related international instruments. The experts note the absence of an explicit incorporation 
of acts of xenophobia and related intolerance in international instruments and recommend that 
CERD adopt a general recommendation to rectify this lacuna. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p>59. In the absence of protection by the State by virtue of citizenship, the situation of stateless 
persons is particularly fragile in many respects. If racial prejudice and xenophobic attitudes are 
widespread in a given society, one can assume with great probability that they will affect 
primarily this group of people. Strengthening the protection of stateless persons is, therefore, an 
important aspect of the struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. 
</p>
<p>60. The DDPA does not specifically refer to stateless persons but many of its stipulations are 
mutatis mutandis of great relevance to them. Racism faced by stateless persons prompted the 
development of international standards that link<b> </b>the general protection of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>42
</b>  Paragraph 6. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>stateless persons with the prohibition of distinctions made on the grounds of race, ethnic or 
national origin. Article 3 of the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 
stipulates that the provisions of this treaty should be applied to stateless persons without 
discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin while article 9 of the 1961 Convention on 
the Reduction of Statelessness prohibits the deprivation of one&#8217;s nationality on racial, ethnic, 
religious or political grounds. Finally, the 1985 Declaration on the Human Rights of Individuals 
Who are not Nationals of the Country in which They Live extends the principles of protection 
laid down therein to all aliens without difference, including nationals of other States and stateless 
persons. Article 7 of this Declaration specifically makes illegal individual or collective expulsion 
of aliens on grounds of race, colour, religion, culture, descent or national or ethnic origin. 
</p>
<p>61. In its general recommendation No. 30 (2005) on discrimination against non-citizens, 
CERD asserts that article 1, paragraph 2 of ICERD, which permits differentiation between 
citizens and non-citizens, &#8220;&#8230; must be construed so as to avoid undermining the basic prohibition 
of discrimination;&#8221;<b>43</b> CERD further confirms that although some of the rights pronounced in 
article 5 of the Convention may be confined only to citizens, &#8220;&#8230; human rights are, in principle, 
to be enjoyed by all persons. States parties are under an obligation to guarantee equality between 
citizens and non-citizens in the enjoyment of these rights to the extent recognized under 
international law.&#8221;<b>44</b> In the same general recommendation, CERD also urges States parties to 
take a number of actions to protect the human rights of non-citizens, including inter alia by 
ensuring that non-citizens enjoy equal protection and recognition before the law and access to 
citizenship or naturalization.

<p>62. The Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 15 (1986) on the position of 
aliens under the Covenant, reconfirms that aliens are protected under ICCPR by emphasizing 
that &#8220;in general, the rights set forth in the Covenant apply to everyone, irrespective of 
reciprocity, and irrespective of his or her nationality or statelessness.&#8221;<b>45</b> In general comment 
No. 17 (1989) on article 24 (Rights of the child), the Human Rights Committee asserts that, &#8220;no 
discrimination with regard to the acquisition of nationality should be admissible under 
international law as between legitimate children and children born out of wedlock or of stateless 
parents or based on the nationality status of one or both of the parents.&#8221;<b>46</b> General comment 
No. 27 (1999) on article 12, paragraph 4 (Freedom of movement) specifies that the right of a 
person to enter his or her own country recognizes the special relationship of a person to that

<p>country. The wording of article 12, paragraph 4, does not distinguish between nationals and 
aliens (&#8220;no one&#8221;). The language permits a broader interpretation that might embrace other 
categories of long-term residents, including but not limited to stateless persons arbitrarily 
deprived of the right to acquire the nationality of the country of such residence.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. The experts recognize that fundamental human rights are guaranteed to stateless persons 
under international law. However, they wish to draw the attention of the international community 
to the uncertain status of this group of people in the context of the right to return to one&#8217;s own 
country. It is clear that arbitrary expulsion is prohibited under international law in relation to 
every person, but the right to return benefits prima facie only citizens of a given country. The 
situation of stateless persons is less favourable. Indeed, their right to return to the country of 
residence or the country of origin is questioned and the grounds of race and/or ethnic origin play 
an important role. Therefore, it is important that this problem be effectively addressed primarily 
by the Human Rights Committee in the context of article 12, paragraph 4 of ICCPR, essentially 
through some supplementary inputs to general comment No. 27. 
</p>
<p>64. Most experts in the field agree that today de jure statelessness is overshadowed by the even 
greater crisis caused by de facto statelessness resulting from irregular migration, which 
contributes to the evolution of a &#8220;grey zone of de facto statelessness.&#8221;<b>48</b> The experts are of the 
opinion that this problem should be examined by the human rights treaty bodies, both in their 
general comments and concluding observations. 
</p>
<p>65. The experts are also seriously concerned by the exceptionally low rate of ratifications of 
the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons,<b>49</b> and the still lower number of 
ratifications of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>66. Internal displacement is a worldwide phenomenon causing suffering for at least 22 million 
people who have been forced to flee or leave their homes within their own countries. According 
to Francis M. Deng, former Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced

<p>persons (IDPs),<b>51</b> internal displacement &#8220;breaks up families, cuts social and cultural ties, 
terminates dependable employment relationships, disrupts educational opportunities, denies 
access to such vital necessities as food, shelter and medicine, and exposes innocent persons to 
such acts of violence as attacks on camps, disappearances and rape.&#8221;<b>52</b> IDPs relocated in an 
unfamiliar environment are particularly vulnerable to racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia that serve to make their situation even worse. 
</p>
<p>67. The DDPA recognizes with concern instances of various forms of racism, xenophobia and 
related intolerance against internally displaced persons.<b>53</b> None of the human rights instruments 
includes provisions specifically related to internal displacement. Nevertheless, their general 
provisions prohibiting discrimination based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin 
are fully applicable to IDPs as holders of human rights. In its general recommendation 
No. 22 (1996) on article 5 of the Convention on refugees and displaced persons, CERD 
addresses the rights of displaced persons to return to their homes of origin under conditions of 
safety; to have the right to participate fully and equally in public affairs at all levels; and to have 
equal access to public services and to receive rehabilitation assistance.<b>54</b> In its general 
recommendation No. 24 (1999) on article 12 of the Convention (women and health), the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women urges States to pay special 
attention to the health needs and rights of women belonging to vulnerable and disadvantaged 
groups, such as inter alia internally displaced women.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>68. The situation of IDPs is extensively addressed by the Guiding Principles on internal 
displacement prepared by Mr. Francis Deng.<b>56</b> The Commission on Human Rights expressed its 
appreciation of this document and welcomed the fact that an increasing number of States, 
United Nations agencies and regional and NGO organizations are applying it as a standard.<b>57</b> The

</p>
<p>Guiding Principles cover a broad range of the human rights of displaced persons and proclaim 
that the Principles shall be applied without discrimination of any kind. They address protection 
from displacement, the situation during displacement, humanitarian assistance, as well as return, 
resettlement and reintegration. The reporting guidelines adopted by CERD only refer to the 
situation of displaced persons.<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69. Although the conventional mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) was established to deal with the situation of refugees, in practice, on the 
basis of relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and directives of the Executive 
Committee, UNHCR has extended its operational mandate and field of competence to cover 
IDPs as well. 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Normatively, the Guiding Principles have been accepted as a set of standards by an 
increasing number of States, United Nations agencies, as well as regional organization, and 
are applied as such. This and the interpretation by CERD of its mandate as also covering 
the situation of IDPs prompt the experts to the conclusion that for the time being there is 
no need for further standard setting in this regard. However, with a view to 
strengthening the protection of IDPs, the experts recommend the General Assembly to 
uphold the call of the Commission on Human Rights for the observance and 
implementation of the Guiding Principles as standards. In such a resolution, the 
General Assembly may wish to stress the importance of the protection of IDPs against 
racism and xenophobia. 
</b></p>
<p><b>D.  Descent-based communities 
</b></p>
<p>71. Descent-based discrimination has historically been a feature of societies in different 
regions of the world and is manifested in various forms of injustice. It is estimated that 
260 million people worldwide are affected by such discrimination. Its persistence and the 
urgent need to remedy its consequences have resulted in Governments of many 
countries recognizing the complexity of this problem and adopting legislation and policies to 
confront it. 
</p>
<p>72. The DDPA recognizes in several provisions that racism and xenophobia based on descent 
constitute major contemporary human rights challenges.<b>59</b> Following on the recommendations of 
the DDPA, the Commission on Human Rights established in its resolution 2002/68 a Working 
Group of Experts on People of African Descent composed of five independent experts to study 
the problems of racial discrimination faced by people of African descent.

</p>
<p>73. CERD in its general recommendation No. 29 (2002) on article 1, paragraph 1 of the 
Convention (Descent) confirms its view that the &#8220;term &#8216;descent&#8217; in article 1, paragraph 1 of the 
Convention does not solely refer to &#8216;race&#8217; and has a meaning and application which complement 
the other prohibited grounds of discrimination&#8221; and that &#8220;discrimination based on &#8216;descent&#8217; 
includes discrimination against members of communities based on forms of social stratification 
such as caste and analogous systems of inherited status which nullify or impair their equal 
enjoyment of human rights.&#8221;<b>60</b> CERD attempted to identify various factors that may point to the 
existence of descent-based communities who suffer from discrimination, including the 
following: inability or restricted ability to alter inherited status; socially enforced restrictions on 
marriage outside the community; private and public segregation, including in housing and 
education, access to public spaces, places of worship and public sources of food and water; 
limitation of freedom to renounce inherited occupations or degrading or hazardous work; 
subjection to debt bondage; subjection to dehumanizing discourses referring to pollution or 
untouchability; and generalized lack of respect for their human dignity and equality. 
</p>
<p>74. In general recommendation No. 29, CERD issued a series of detailed recommendations 
which if implemented would serve to alleviate the problems resulting from discrimination based 
on descent. Although CERD made the adoption of the proposed measures subject to the 
assessment of their appropriateness under particular circumstances by States parties, the relevant 
recommendations serve the development of the existing standards, in particular with regard to 
their application. Forty-eight recommendations are grouped into eight chapters: (a) measures of a 
general nature; (b) multiple discrimination against members of descent-based communities; 
(c) segregation; (d) dissemination of hate speech including through the mass media and the 
Internet; (e) administration of justice; (f) civil and political rights; (g) economic and social rights; 
and (h) right to education. 
</p>
<p>75. At the level of the Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
(the Sub-Commission), the latter adopted a resolution calling for a study on discrimination based 
on work and descent to be undertaken.<b>61</b> The Commission endorsed the request and entrusted two 
Special Rapporteurs with the task of preparing a comprehensive study on discrimination based 
on work and descent. The Special Rapporteurs submitted their progress report to the Human 
Rights Council in 2006.<b>62</b> It contains a set of principles and guidelines highlighting the 
international standards prohibiting discrimination based on work and descent.<b>63</b>

</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>76. The experts share the cohesive view of international bodies that descent-based 
discrimination constitutes one of the greatest challenges to the efforts aimed at countering racism 
and xenophobia. Considering, however, the steps taken by CERD to extend the applicability of 
ICERD to descent-based communities, and in particular its general recommendation No. 29, the 
experts discern no substantive gaps as regards the protection of members of descent-based 
communities from racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Similarly to 
other forms of discrimination, inadequate implementation and lack of political will remain 
among the basic barriers impeding the elimination of this form of discrimination. It would be 
equally important if other human rights treaty monitoring bodies paid appropriate attention to 
problems faced by descent-based communities during the examinations of States parties&#8217; reports 
and individual communications. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>77. According to United Nation estimates, approximately 300 million indigenous people live 
in more than 70 countries worldwide. The situation of indigenous peoples in various parts of the 
world is characterized by a high degree of vulnerability to discrimination on the grounds of race 
or ethnic origin. The Durban Conference expressed its &#8220;concern that in some States political and 
legal structures or institutions, some of which were inherited and persist today, do not 
correspond to the multi-ethnic, pluricultural and plurilingual characteristics of the population 
and, in many cases, constitute an important factor of discrimination in the exclusion of 
indigenous peoples.&#8221;<b>64</b> The DDPA further specifies the required measures for guaranteeing the 
fundamental rights of indigenous peoples and their protection against racism. It also recognizes 
the challenges being faced by indigenous peoples in the contemporary world, particularly as 
regards their special relationship with the land as the basis for their spiritual, physical and 
cultural existence.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p>78. The 2005 World Summit Outcome firmly reiterated the commitment of the international 
community to protect the human rights of indigenous peoples, linking them directly with 
sustainable development, and in particular with the fight against hunger and poverty.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p>79. At present, the most comprehensive international instrument concerning indigenous 
peoples is ILO Convention No. 169 of 1989 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries and which so far has been ratified by only eighteen countries: thirteen 
Latin American, four European, and one Asian.

</p>
<p>80. The core human rights treaties do not specifically refer to indigenous peoples (with the 
exception of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).<b>67</b> Nevertheless, there is no doubt 
that article 1, paragraph 1 of ICERD, and other norms of human rights treaties prohibiting 
discrimination also apply. 
</p>
<p>81. The plight of indigenous peoples was the focus of CERD general recommendation 
No. 23 (1997) on the rights of indigenous peoples, which inter alia states that &#8220;discrimination 
against indigenous peoples falls under the scope of the Convention and that all appropriate 
means must be taken to combat and eliminate such discrimination&#8221;.<b>68</b> Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women general recommendation No. 24 (1999) on 
article 12 of the Convention (women and health) pays special attention to the health needs and 
rights of women belonging to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including indigenous 
peoples.<b>69</b> Article 30 of the CRC proclaims the right of a child of indigenous origin to enjoy his 
or her own culture, to profess and practise his or her own religion, or to use his or her own 
language. The reporting guidelines adopted by CERD only mention the situation of indigenous 
peoples.<b>70</b> 
</p>
<p>82. The 2005 World Summit Outcome called upon States to conclude negotiations on and 
approve as soon as possible the United Nations draft declaration on the rights of indigenous 
peoples, under discussion by the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Commission 
on Human Rights since 1995.<b>71</b> The draft was eventually adopted by the Human Rights Council 
in 2006 but it is still pending on the agenda of the General Assembly.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>67
</b>  The CRC was adopted in 1989, and entered into force in 1990. With 192 States parties as 
</p>
<p>of 7 October 2005, it is the United Nations human rights instrument enjoying the most universal 
ratification.

<p>  It is worth noting that the second World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 called on the 
Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of 
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to complete the drafting of the declaration on the 
rights of indigenous people that had been on its agenda for several years. 
<b>72
</b></p>
<p>  On 30 January 2007, the Assembly of the African Union adopted a decision 
(Assembly/AU/ Dec. 141 (VIII)) on the draft declaration, maintaining a united position in the 
negotiations on amending the declaration and finding a solution to the concerns of African 
States, amongst the most important of which are questions about: (a) the definition of indigenous 
peoples; (b) self-determination; (c) ownership of land and resources; (d) establishment of distinct 
political and economic institutions; and (e) national and territorial integrity. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>83. The experts share the opinion expressed by CERD in its general recommendation No. 23 
and consider that ICERD covers protection against racially motivated discrimination towards 
indigenous peoples. They are of the opinion that an effective countering of racism affecting 
indigenous peoples requires a strengthening of the overall protection of their human rights. In 
this context, the experts support a swift approval of the aforementioned declaration on the rights 
of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>84. In addition, the experts believe that the universal ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 
can also be a significant step towards the protection of the human rights of indigenous peoples. 
Therefore, the experts wish to encourage Member States to consider this step as a matter of 
priority. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>85. Persons belonging to minorities amount to perhaps 30 per cent of the world population.<b>73</b> 
The overall vulnerability of minorities is significantly enhanced in the context of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The dramatic record of recent genocides and 
crimes against humanity provides evidence of the terrible potential of large scale violations of 
minority rights. Equally convincing is the observation that protection of minorities is presently 
one of the most effective ways to prevent conflicts or ensure sustainable peace. In other words, 
protection of minorities is not only a basic guarantee for the rights holders but also one of the 
fundamental tools to resolve social problems. Not surprisingly, the rights of minorities is one of 
the major concerns addressed throughout the DDPA<b>74</b> which inter alia &#8220;Urges States to take, 
where applicable, appropriate measures to prevent racial discrimination against persons 
belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities with respect to employment, 
health care, housing, social services and education, and in this context forms of multiple 
discrimination should be taken into account.&#8221;<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>86. Article 1, paragraph 1 of ICERD does not specifically address minorities but according to 
CERD it &#8220;relates to all persons who belong to different races, national or ethnic groups or to 
indigenous peoples. If the Committee is to secure the proper consideration of the periodic reports 
of States parties, it is essential that States parties provide as far as possible the Committee with 
information on the presence within their territory of such groups.&#8221;<b>76</b> In its general

<p>A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 4 (1973) concerning reporting by States parties (article 1 of the 
Convention), CERD invited States parties to include in their periodic reports relevant 
information concerning the demographic composition of the population. CERD further 
acknowledged that there is an international standard concerning the specific rights of people 
belonging to ethnic groups, together with generally recognized norms concerning equal rights for 
all and non-discrimination, including those incorporated in the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. At the same time, CERD took a position 
against arbitrary treatment of minority groups in recognizing their existence and pointing to the 
need for applying the same criteria to all of them, in particular with regard to the number of 
persons, their being of a race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin different from the 
majority, or from other groups within the population.<b>77</b> 
87. Article 27 of ICCPR guarantees that &#8220;In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community 
with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their 
own religion, or to use their own language.&#8221; In its general comment No. 23 (1994) on article 27 
(Rights of minorities), the Human Rights Committee states that &#8220;the persons designed to be 
protected are those who belong to a group and who share in common a culture, a religion and/or 
a language.&#8221;<b>78</b> Further, these rights apply to all individuals within the territory of the State party 
and not just to citizens alone.<b>79</b> Lastly, States parties are under an obligation to take positive 
measures of protection &#8220;not only against the acts of the State party itself &#8230; but also against the 
acts of other persons within the State party.&#8221;<b>80</b> 
</p>
<p>88. The most comprehensive United Nations instrument dealing with the protection of 
minorities is the 1992 Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities. This document, which lays down specific rights of persons 
belonging to minorities and defines the related obligations of States, is however of a non-binding 
nature. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Working Group on Minorities of the Sub-Commission in its recent report indicated 
&#8220;that addressing the rights of minorities remains one of the most marginalized issues within the

<p>human rights mechanisms in the United Nations.&#8221;<b>81</b> In this context, the experts welcome the 
establishment of the mandate of the Independent expert on minority issues<b>82</b> and call on the 
United Nations mechanisms to address minority issues, always when appropriate. 
</p>
<p>90. The experts have found no substantive normative gaps in the protection of persons 
belonging to cultural or ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities from racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. However, in this context, comments made in 
the section on religious groups in chapter II should also be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>91. This assessment in no way contradicts the need for further determined efforts at the 
national and international levels to fully implement the relevant standards. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  People under foreign occupation 
</b></p>
<p>92. The protection of the civilian population under foreign occupation has been on the agenda 
of the international community for a long time. The history of armed conflicts shows that the 
particular vulnerability of this group is dramatically enhanced if it is connected to racial or ethnic 
distinction from the occupying power. The Durban Declaration expresses concern about the 
plight of the Palestinian people under foreign occupation.<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>93. In the area under discussion, two branches of international law offer protection against 
racism, xenophobia and related discrimination, namely human rights law and humanitarian law. 
Although the situation of people under foreign occupation has not been spelled out under any of 
the international human rights treaties, there is no doubt that States parties to them are 
responsible for their implementation, not only within their own territories but also within all 
territories under their control. 
</p>
<p>94. General comment No. 31 (2004) of the Human Rights Committee on the nature of the 
general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant provides a clear interpretation 
in this regard. In interpreting article 2, paragraph 1 of ICCPR, it underlines inter alia that &#8220;a State 
party must respect and ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the power or 
effective control of that State party, even if not situated within the territory of the State party &#8230; . 
This principle also applies to those within the power or effective control of the forces of a State 
party acting outside its territory, regardless of the circumstances in which such power or

an initial period of two years.

<p>effective control was obtained &#8230;.&#8221;<b>84</b> These comments are directly relevant only to States parties 
of ICCPR. However, since they tackle the nature of States parties obligations under a human 
rights treaty they seem to also clarify the applicability, mutatis mutandis, of other human rights 
treaties to people under foreign occupation. Hence, States parties who occupy a territory are 
obliged to counter racism and xenophobia affecting all parts of the population under their control 
and bear full responsibility in this respect under the respective human rights treaties to which 
they are party. 
</p>
<p>95. People under foreign occupation are protected also by international humanitarian law. 
Article 2 of Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of 
War stipulates that &#8220;the Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of 
the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed 
resistance.&#8221; Article 4 states that, &#8220;Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given 
moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in 
the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals.&#8221; 
Common article 3 to all four Geneva Conventions as well as Additional Protocols I relating to 
the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts and II relating to the Protection of 
Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, contain provisions that establish the obligation of 
States parties to treat humanely all persons under their control and prohibit distinctions made on 
the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, wealth, birth or other status, or on any other similar criteria.<b>85</b> All these instruments 
specify various specific minimum standards which must be respected by each party to a 
conflict.<b>86</b> 
</p>
<p>96. It is important to note that the protection extended to people under foreign occupation by 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law should be considered in an 
integrated way. General comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee rightly observes that: 
&#8220;While, in respect of certain Covenant rights, more specific rules of international humanitarian 
law may be especially relevant for the purposes of the interpretation of Covenant rights, both

statelessness, such as asylum-seekers, refugees, migrant workers and other persons, who may 
find themselves in the territory or subject to the jurisdiction of the State Party.

that article 3 applies as well to international armed conflicts. ICJ reports (1986), para. 218. </p>

</p>
<p>spheres of law are complementary, not mutually exclusive.&#8221;<b>87</b> Thus, in order to counter racism 
and xenophobia under foreign occupation it is necessary to draw on both branches of law, 
looking for the most effective means. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>97. The experts agree, of course, that foreign occupation significantly heightens the risk of 
racial and xenophobic discrimination against the affected population. While examining the 
modalities of an appropriate response to such a situation, the experts arrived at the conclusion 
that normatively it is covered by both international humanitarian and human rights law. The 
problem is, however, that it is precisely under foreign occupation that international mechanisms, 
as experience shows, have limited impact, if any, and thus, an effective protection against racism 
and xenophobia is particularly problematic. 
</p>
<p>98. The experts hope that the proclamation of the responsibility to protect in the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome, reiterated by the Security Council, opens a new avenue to combat the most 
severe human rights violations, including under foreign occupation. This approach can contribute 
to countering racism and xenophobia and ensure the accountability of perpetrators of related 
crimes include those involving genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
</p>
<p>99. The experts consider it appropriate that CERD assess the need for recommendations 
concerning the issue of racial and xenophobic discrimination under foreign occupation. 
</p>
<p><b>III. COMPLEMENTARY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS  
WITH REGARD TO MANIFESTATIONS OF RACISM,  
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA AND  
RELATED INTOLERANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Multiple discrimination or aggravated forms of racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>100. It is widely recognized that groups most exposed to racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance frequently suffer multiple discrimination.<b>88</b> The experts 
understand the language &#8220;multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination&#8221; within the meaning of 
paragraph 2 of the Durban Declaration which recognizes &#8220;that racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or 
ethnic origin and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination based on 
other related grounds such as sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, social origin, 
property, birth or other status.&#8221; Also in the Durban Programme of Action numerous references 
are made to multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination.<b>89</b>

<p>A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>101. All human rights treaties and instruments proclaim the principles of equality and 
non-discrimination, with explicit (but not exclusive) reference to several grounds such as gender, 
race, language, religion, disability. In the decisions and comments of the treaty bodies several 
other grounds, such as age and sexual orientation have been covered and included as prohibited 
grounds of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>102. All core instruments of international human rights law apply to various grounds of 
discrimination. Linking different provisions of those instruments which concern different 
grounds of discrimination can give birth to a functional approach in addressing multiple 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>103. The international instruments concerning the protection of specific categories of rights 
holders, such as children, migrants, people with disabilities, address the issue of multiple 
discrimination in a direct way through their non-discrimination clauses in connection with 
specific substantive provisions. They can be fully applied with a view to countering multiple 
discrimination. Two of the core human rights treaties exclusively mention those grounds of 
discrimination, the countering of which was the overall purpose of their adoption, namely 
ICERD and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
(CEDAW) and, more recently, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD). 
</p>
<p>104. ICERD refers only to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin; however, CERD in several 
general recommendations leaves no doubt that this body is aware of the phenomenon of multiple 
discrimination and is determined to address its various manifestations.<b>90</b> To illustrate the CERD 
approach, one can take the example of the protection of women. General recommendation 
No. 25 (2000) on gender-related dimensions of racial discrimination states that &#8220;&#8230; racial 
discrimination does not always affect women and men equally or in the same way. There are 
circumstances in which racial discrimination only or primarily affects women, or affects women 
in a different way, or to a different degree than men.&#8221;<b>91</b> CERD points out that racial 
discrimination may have consequences that affect women only or primarily such as pregnancy 
resulting from racially motivated rape.<b>92</b> In its general recommendation No. 29 (2002) on 
article 1, paragraph 1 of the Convention (Descent), CERD urges States parties to take into 
account the situation of women members of descent-based communities as victims of multiple 
discrimination, sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.<b>93</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>90
</b>  See e.g. general recommendations No. 22 (1996) on article 5 of the Convention on refugees 
</p>
<p>and displaced persons, No. 23 (1997) on the rights of indigenous peoples, No. 24 (1999) 
concerning article 1 of the Convention, No. 25 (2000) on gender-related dimensions of racial 
discrimination and No. 30 (2005) on discrimination against non-citizens. 
<b>91
</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 1. 
<b>92
</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 2.  
<b>93
</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 2 (k). </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>105. The scope of article 1 of CEDAW is wide enough to embrace instances where women are 
victims of multiple grounds of discrimination. This view is reinforced by article 2 (c), which 
places an obligation on States parties to condemn discrimination against women in all its forms 
and undertake to establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men, 
and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions, the effective 
protection of women against any act of discrimination. Regarding article 2 (e) States parties are 
to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise. Further, 
under article 6 States parties are to suppress all forms of trafficking in women. 
</p>
<p>106. In its general recommendation No. 19 (1992) on violence against women, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stated that &#8220;The definition of 
discrimination includes gender-based violence, that is, violence that is directed against a woman 
because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately.&#8221;<b>94</b> The Committee also 
pointed out that States must take all positive measures to eliminate gender violence, taking into 
account &#8220;the close connection between discrimination against women, gender-based violence, 
and violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8221;<b>95</b> In its General 
Recommendation 24 (1999) on article 12 of the Convention (women and health), the Committee 
calls for special attention to be paid &#8220;to the health needs and rights of women belonging to 
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, such as migrant women, refugee and internally displaced 
women, the girl child and older women, women in prostitution, indigenous women &#8230;&#8221;.<b>96</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>107. Numerous studies and publications establish that the diversity in manifestations of multiple 
discrimination seems to demand a further elaboration. The purpose of this endeavour should be 
to address the phenomenon under discussion from different angles because its complex nature 
requires diversified and complementary approaches. In this context, there is no justification for 
restricting protection against multiple discrimination to the grounds that are explicitly mentioned 
in the DDPA. Here, as in the case of international human rights treaties, the list of prohibited 
grounds of discrimination is open-ended. Despite the fact that some characteristics, including 
nationality, age, health status, HIV-positive status, marital status, sexual orientation and gender 
identity when combined with race render certain categories of persons particularly vulnerable to 
discriminatory practices, they have not been to date universally recognized as factors aggravating 
racial discrimination. It is important that international protection against racism embraces these 
factors which create the phenomenon of multiple discrimination and result in the exclusion of 
people falling into the combined categories. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>96
</b>  Paragraph 6. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>108. The underlying question is whether the existing legal standards sufficiently counter these 
phenomena. It is clear that the prohibition of multiple discrimination is already well established 
in law since various forms of discrimination are prohibited. The existing standards provide 
sufficient basis for protection against multiple discrimination at the national level in terms of 
responsibility and remedies. However, multiple discrimination is not only a sum of specific 
manifestations of discrimination, but it creates a new class of discrimination, whereby 
discrimination on the basis of several grounds creates a new form. 
</p>
<p>109. It is this phenomenon which amounts to aggravated victimization and marginalization of 
large groups of people. In order to combat this phenomenon, it is important to capture its 
contours through a definition which would take into account its complex nature. 
</p>
<p>110. The experts believe that a methodology of diagnosis of the phenomenon under discussions 
is still missing. While some of the well-recognised grounds of discrimination are extensively 
addressed and developed through law and jurisprudence others have only recently been 
recognised. The assessment of multiple discrimination is lacking a coherent and integrated 
approach. This leads to accountability gaps, since the legal basis is missing that would enable 
competent organs, in particular domestic courts, tribunals and commissions, to draw 
consequences adequate to the severity of multiple discrimination. Finally, the available tools to 
react effectively to multiple discrimination, including early warning mechanisms, seem to be 
inadequate. 
</p>
<p>111. Therefore, the experts are inclined to conclude that the phenomenon of multiple 
discrimination needs to be addressed, with a particular focus on: the recognition of its diversified 
characteristics; definition of linkages between different grounds of discrimination; and an 
understanding of the consequences of their combined manifestations. To that end, it would be 
most appropriate for the treaty bodies, in particular CERD, to analyse the issue of multiple 
discrimination and aggravated forms of discrimination with racial aspects and adopt general 
comments on the methodology for countering this phenomena. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ethnic cleansing 
</b></p>
<p>112. According to the Secretary-General the term &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; came to be known as a 
process the central objective of which was using military means to terrorize civilian populations 
with the goal of forcing their flight from a certain territory.<b>97</b> Similarly, according to the Appeals 
Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ethnic cleansing 
refers to &#8220;the shared intention on the part of a group to forcibly remove members of one ethnicity 
from their town, village or region (to effect &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;) with the consequence that, in the 
course of doing so, one or more of the victims is shot and killed.&#8221;<b>98</b>

<p> A/HRC/4/WG.3/6

</p>
<p>113. The DDPA does not use the term ethnic cleansing but in several places links the forced 
displacement and the movement of people from their countries of origin as refugees and 
asylum-seekers with racism and xenophobia.<b>99</b> Equally important are the provisions that refer to 
the protection of ethnic minorities.<b>100</b> 
</p>
<p>114. Similarly, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court does not explicitly refer to 
ethnic cleansing. However, under its article 7 crimes against Humanity include inter alia extermination; deportation or forcible transfer of population; and persecution against any 
identifiable community or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, 
gender ... or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international 
law, in connection with any act referred to in this article or any other crime falling within the 
jurisdiction of the Court.<b>101</b> 
115. None of the international human rights treaties directly mentions the concept of ethnic 
cleansing but several provisions of these instruments are relevant in this context. In particular, 
one should refer here to the non-discrimination clauses, stipulations or treaty interpretations 
concerning protection of minorities and provisions prohibiting any advocacy of national, racial 
or religious superiority or hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence.<b>102</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>116. The underlying question is whether ethnic cleansing as a manifestation of racism is 
adequately countered and persecuted persons or groups are sufficiently protected by existing 
legal standards. Despite the lack of a legal definition of ethnic cleansing under international law, 
the experts are of the opinion that it is sufficiently covered by human rights treaties on the one 
hand, and the stipulations of international criminal law concerning crimes against humanity on 
the other. Nevertheless, the experts would welcome efforts towards the development of a legal 
definition for ethnic cleansing. Such a definition would be helpful in developing a more targeted 
approach to this particular manifestation of racism and pave the way to more resolute preventive 
action.

<p>  The crime of persecution has been recognized as a particularly serious crime since a

</p>
<p>117. At present, special emphasis should be placed in this respect on CERD early warning 
measures and urgent procedures and United Nations early warning mechanisms, including 
interaction between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other concerned 
United Nations agencies.<b>103 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Genocide 
</b></p>
<p>118. The crime of genocide and its links to discrimination based on ethnicity, race and religion 
is defined by the 1951 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
as &#8220;any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, 
ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious 
bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group 
conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; 
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring 
children of the group to another group.&#8221;<b>104</b> This Convention has been recognized as part of 
customary international law<b>105</b> and the statutes of the International Court of Justice, the 
International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Tribunal for 
Rwanda (ICTR) all reiterate the definition of the crime of genocide as contained in the 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>119. The DDPA recognizes &#8220;that apartheid and genocide &#8230; constitute crimes against humanity 
and are major sources and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, and acknowledge the untold evil and suffering caused by these acts.&#8221;<b>106</b> The 
DPPA also affirms that wherever and whenever these acts occur, they must be condemned and 
their recurrence prevented.<b>107</b> </p>
<p>120. The definition of genocide under the aforementioned Convention and the jurisprudence of 
the ICTY and ICTR provide clearly that in the case of genocide, victims are targeted by reason 
of their membership in a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. ICERD does not contain 
specific clauses referring to genocide but emphasizes that States parties are to &#8220;condemn all

<p>propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race 
or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial 
hatred and discrimination in any form&#8230;&#8221;.<b>108</b> In this way the principle of prevention is 
highlighted. Recognizing the importance of punishing genocide and crimes against humanity, as 
well as war crimes in the context of racism and racial discrimination, CERD decided to issue 
general recommendation No. 18 (1994) on the establishment of an international tribunal to 
prosecute crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>121. The experts have concluded that no normative substantive gap exists in protection against 
racism and racial discrimination when these escalate to the level of genocide. 
</p>
<p>122. <b>However, the experts would like to reiterate the recommendation made in the section 
of the report which addresses ethnic cleansing, that emphasis be placed on CERD early 
warning measures and urgent procedures and United Nations early warning mechanisms, 
including interaction between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other 
concerned United Nations agencies. While re-emphasizing the need for the ratification of 
human rights and other relevant international treaties, the experts would also like to stress 
the importance of a prompt universal ratification of the Rome Statute in this context. 
</b></p>
<p><b>D.  Religious intolerance and defamation of religious symbols 
</b></p>
<p>123. The experts acknowledge that religious intolerance often constitutes an essential part of 
contemporary manifestations of racism. The numerous assaults on religious symbols and attacks 
on places of worship are particularly severe and dangerous expressions of racism. Moreover, 
defamation of religious symbols can lead to incitement to religious intolerance. 
</p>
<p>124. The subject discussed here has already been largely addressed in other parts of this report, 
namely Chapter II, section A and chapter III, sections A and F. The analysis and 
recommendations contained therein are mutatis mutandis applicable to religious intolerance. 
Therefore, the experts will limit their views in this chapter to some specific additional comments. 
</p>
<p>125. In recent times, an alarming increase in violence and discrimination based on religion or 
belief can be observed. As a contemporary phenomenon, discrimination based on various 
grounds, such as race, colour, and descent, national or ethnic origin, is frequently aggravated by 
the closely related ground of religion or belief. The DDPA notes with particular concern the 
existence in various parts of the world of religious intolerance against religious communities and 
their members.<b>109</b> In this regard, the DDPA urges States to adopt legislative and other measures

</p>
<p>to protect minorities, including religious minorities, from any form of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.<b>110</b> The DDPA also calls on States to 
implement policies and programmes in their educational institutions that promote respect and 
tolerance for religious diversity, as human rights education is an effective means for combating 
racism.<b>111</b> 
</p>
<p>126. States are urged to implement policies and measures that are designed to prevent and 
eliminate all such discrimination on the basis of religion and belief<b>112</b> and to promote and protect 
the exercise of the rights set out in the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.<b>113</b> Finally, the DDPA stresses 
that religion, spirituality and belief can contribute to the eradication of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.<b>114</b> 
</p>
<p>127. The 1981 Declaration is the central piece of international legislation in the area under 
discussion. It asserts inter alia that: &#8220;Discrimination between human beings on the grounds of 
religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the principles of the 
Charter of the United Nations, and shall be condemned as a violation of the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and enunciated 
in detail in the International Covenants on Human Rights, and as an obstacle to friendly and 
peaceful relations between nations.&#8221;<b>115</b> 
</p>
<p>128. It is, however, not a binding document. In this context, it is becoming even more important 
that United Nations intergovernmental bodies attach sufficient importance to its implementation. 
In resolutions referring to the implementation of the Declaration, the Commission on Human 
Rights urged States to take &#8220;all appropriate measures&#8221;, in conformity with international standards 
for human rights, to guarantee freedom of religion and belief and to combat religious intolerance 
and acts of violence.<b>116</b> In a number of resolutions, the Commission also called on States to 
ensure that all public officials, including members of law enforcement bodies, in the course of 
their official duties respect different religions and beliefs and do not discriminate on the grounds

<p>of religion and belief, and that they are trained and educated accordingly.<b>117</b> With regard to 
implementation measures, States were urged &#8220;to ensure that religious places, sites and shrines are 
fully respected and protected and to take additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable 
to desecration or destruction.&#8221;<b>118</b> In its resolution 55/254, the General Assembly highlighted the 
fact that religious sites &#8220;represent an important aspect of the collective heritage of humankind.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>129. The Commission specified &#8220;that in the context of the fight against terrorism and the 
reaction to counter-terrorism measures, defamation of religions becomes an aggravating factor 
that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms of target groups, as well as their 
economic and social exclusion.&#8221;<b>119</b> In its resolution 61/61, the General Assembly also stated that 
equating any religion with terrorism must be avoided, as this may have adverse consequences on 
the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all members of religious 
communities concerned. Finally, the General Assembly stated that dialogue and education are 
the means to cultivate greater respect, tolerance, and understanding with regards to religion or 
belief.<b>120</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>130. The experts are of the view that there is an increase in religious intolerance, and incitement 
to religious hatred. Equally well-founded is the observation that religious intolerance and 
violations of the right to freedom of religion have increased substantially in the aftermath of 
11 September 2001. These developments give rise to serious concerns, which need to be 
addressed in a thoughtful and effective way. From the perspective of their mandate, however, the 
experts are of the opinion that religious intolerance combined with racial and xenophobic 
prejudices is adequately covered under international human rights instruments. Yet, it is in light 
of the concerns of the international community regarding the rise in religious intolerance that 
CERD may wish to consider adopting a recommendation stating explicitly the advantages of 
multicultural education in combating religious intolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Racial discrimination in the private sphere 
</b></p>
<p>131. Manifestations of racism and racial discrimination within the private sphere, such as in the 
relationships between individuals/groups and non-State subjects, constitute a cause for concern. 
It has been widely recognized that on the one hand it is the obligation of the State under human 
rights law to effectively address racism and racial discrimination and protect individuals against 
their impact in the private sphere (horizontal effect); on the other hand, non-State actors bear the 
responsibility not only to refrain from racist conduct but also to ensure respect for the principles 
of equality and non-discrimination within their own realms of activity. 
</p>

page 40 
 
</p>
<p>132. This twofold scope of responsibility within the private sphere is endorsed in the DDPA. In 
several of its provisions, it calls on private actors to counter racism and xenophobia and stresses 
the importance of the elimination of these phenomena by Member States not only from public 
but also from private life.<b>121</b> The experts follow the same approach while examining the 
recommendation of the Intergovernmental Working Group regarding racial discrimination in the 
private sphere.<b>122</b> 
</p>
<p>133. In literal terms, article 1, paragraph 1 of ICERD suggests that the subject of the 
Convention is racial discrimination in the public sphere, since it prohibits racially motivated 
distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference occurring &#8220;in the political, economic, social, 
cultural or any other field of public life.&#8221;<b>123</b> However, the extension of the prohibition of racial 
discrimination beyond the public sphere is already evident in article 2 which imposes an 
obligation on States parties to pursue all means and without delay to eliminate racial 
discrimination in all its forms and to promote understanding among races. This article explicitly 
provides that &#8220;(c) Each State party shall take effective measures to review governmental, 
national and local policies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws and regulations which 
have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists;&#8221; and 
&#8220;(d) Each State party shall prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means, including 
legislation as required by circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or 
organization.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>134. In this connection, States are obliged to address racism and racial discrimination 
originating from other than State-individual relationships. Moreover, article 3 provides for States 
parties to condemn racial segregation and apartheid and article 4 outlaws racial incitement as 
well as racist organizations. States parties are to outlaw propaganda and all organizations which 
are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or 
ethnic origin. Further, public authorities or institutions are not to promote or incite racial 
discrimination. Article 5 imposes an obligation on States parties to guarantee equality before the 
law and the security of person and protection by the State against violence, whether perpetrated 
by government officials or by any other person. This article also guarantees equality in the 
enjoyment of political, civil, social, economic and cultural rights. Finally, article 7 imposes an 
obligation on States parties to adopt immediate and effective measures, particularly in the field 
of teaching, education, culture and information with a view to combating prejudices that lead to 
racial discrimination.

</p>
<p>135. CERD has specifically declared that the reach of the Convention extends to acts beyond 
the public sphere.<b>124</b> In its general recommendation No. 19 (1995) on article 3 of the Convention, 
CERD affirmed that &#8220;&#8230; a condition of partial segregation may also arise as an unintended 
by-product of the actions of private persons&#8221; and that &#8220;&#8230; a condition of racial segregation can 
also arise without any initiative or direct involvement by the public authorities&#8221;.<b>125</b> 
</p>
<p>136. Article 17, paragraph 1 of ICCPR provides that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or 
unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks 
on his honour and reputation. Paragraph 2 further provides that everyone has the right to the 
protection of law against such interference or attacks. The provisions of article 17 should be read 
in the context of article 2 which provides that &#8220;Each State party to the present Covenant 
undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its 
jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such 
as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>137. In this context, general comment No. 31 (2004) of the Human Rights Committee on the 
nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant, is of great 
relevance since it deals with the applicability of the entire Covenant to private actors as duty 
bearers. The Committee stresses that &#8220;The article 2, paragraph 1, obligations are binding on 
States [parties] and do not, as such, have direct horizontal effect as a matter of international law.&#8221; 
The Committee goes on to state that &#8220;The Covenant cannot be viewed as a substitute for 
domestic criminal or civil law. However, the positive obligations on States parties to ensure 
Covenant rights will only be fully discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just 
against violations of Covenant rights by its agents, but also against acts committed by private 
persons or entities that would impair the enjoyment of Covenant rights insofar as they are 
amenable to application between private persons or entities.&#8221; The Committee further specifies 
that &#8220;There may be circumstances in which a failure to ensure Covenant rights as required by 
article 2 would give rise to violations by States parties of those rights &#8230;&#8221;.<b>126</b> 
</p>
<p>138. Some other international human rights instruments include similar provisions on the right 
to privacy, namely CRC in article 16, and ICRMW in article 14. Three other international 
treaties are also relevant in this regard, notably the 1962 Convention on Consent to Marriage, 
Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages, ILO Convention No. 111 of 1958 on 
Discrimination (Employment and Occupation), and the 1960 United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in 
Education.

<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>139. The question arises as to whether by taking into account the aforementioned comments 
concerning the applicability of international human rights treaties, in particular ICERD and 
ICCPR, to the private sphere, there is in this regard a need for complementary human rights 
standards. The experts are not convinced and consider that there is rather an application gap in 
the effective protection against discrimination by private actors. However, since the wording of 
article 1 of ICERD has given rise in the past to some contradictory interpretations concerning the 
scope of protection granted by this Convention, in the interest of clarity the States parties may 
wish to consider adding the words &#8220;or private&#8221; after &#8220;public&#8221; in the definition in article 1, 
paragraph 1 of the Convention in an effort to help eliminate ambiguity in this regard. 
</p>
<p>140. The experts consider that general comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee 
provides a good starting point for addressing the problems of racism and xenophobia in the 
private sphere. Hence, CERD may wish to further elaborate on this issue specifically in the field 
of racial discrimination. The experts suggest that other treaty bodies examine the problem under 
discussion and provide some clarity on the theme through their recommendations and comments. 
An important step would also be to include the topic in reporting guidelines adopted by human 
rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>F. Incitement to racial hatred and dissemination of hate speech and  
xenophobic and caricatural pictures, through traditional mass  
media and information technology, including the Internet 
</b></p>
<p>141. The recent rise in racial attacks, hate speech, xenophobia and acts of disrespect for 
religions, culture and traditions, as well as an increase in racial platforms in traditional and 
modern media are cause for alarm. The experts consider the recent debate on caricatural pictures 
as part of a broader discussion on incitement to racial and religious hatred and the dissemination 
of hate speech. 
</p>
<p>142. The DDPA expresses concern at the progression of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, including their contemporary forms and manifestations, such 
as through the use of new information and communications technologies, including the Internet, 
to disseminate ideas of racial superiority. The Programme of Action specifies actions which 
could be undertaken to counter these developments on the Internet while taking fully into 
account the existing international and regional standards on freedom of expression.<b>127</b> It also 
highlights the importance of human rights education and urges States &#8220;to introduce and, as 
applicable, to reinforce anti-discrimination and anti-racism components in human rights 
programmes in school curricula &#8230;&#8221;.<b>128</b>

<p>143. The World Summit on the Information Society stressed in its Declaration of Principles that 
&#8220;All actors in the Information Society should take appropriate actions and preventive measures, 
as determined by law, against abusive uses of ICTs [information and communication 
technologies], such as illegal and other acts motivated by racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia, and related intolerance, hatred, violence, all forms of child abuse, including 
paedophilia and child pornography, and trafficking in, and exploitation of, human beings.&#8221;<b>129</b> 
</p>
<p>144. Article 4 of ICERD requires States parties to penalize four categories of misconduct: the 
dissemination of ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred; incitement to racial hatred; acts of 
violence against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin; and incitement 
to such acts. Article 7 obliges States parties to undertake to adopt immediate and effective 
measures, particularly in the field of teaching, education, culture and information with a view to 
combating prejudices that lead to racial discrimination. 
145. In its general recommendations No. 7 (1985) relating to the implementation of article 4 and 
No. 15 (1993) on article 4 of the Convention, CERD explained that the provisions of article 4 are 
of a mandatory character. In order to comply with the obligations under this article, States parties 
need to enact appropriate legislation as well as ensure that such legislation is effectively 
enforced. CERD was fully aware of the related problems and stressed in general 
recommendation No. 15 that &#8220;the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial 
superiority or hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression.&#8221; It 
further pointed out that it wished &#8220;to draw to the attention of States parties to article 20 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according to which any advocacy of 
national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence shall be prohibited by law.&#8221;<b>130</b> Despite these specificities, 19 States have entered 
reservations and/or interpretative declarations with respect to article 4 of ICERD. 
</p>
<p>146. Similar obligations have been established under article 20 of ICCPR which compels States 
parties to outlaw any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
to discrimination, hostility or violence. Moreover, the Human Rights Committee stressed in its 
general comment No. 11 (1983) on article 20 that &#8220;For article 20 to become fully effective there 
ought to be a law making it clear that propaganda and advocacy as described therein are contrary 
to public policy and providing for an appropriate sanction in case of violation.&#8221; To this end, the 
Committee further stated that it &#8220;therefore, believes that States parties which have not yet done 
so should take the measures necessary to fulfil the obligations contained in article 20, and should 
themselves refrain from any such propaganda or advocacy.&#8221;<b>131</b>

<p>147. The UNESCO Declaration on Fundamental Principles Concerning the Contribution of the 
Mass Media to Strengthening Peace and International Understanding, to the Promotion of 
Human Rights and to Countering Racialism, Apartheid and Incitement to War<b> </b>states that &#8220;the 
exercise of freedom of opinion, expression and information, recognized as an integral part of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, is a vital factor in the strengthening of peace and 
international understanding&#8221;.<b>132</b>

<p>148. In accordance with article 25, paragraph 3 of the Rome Statute &#8220;a person shall be

occurs or is attempted&#8221;, and with regard to genocide directly and publicly incites others to 
commit it. 
</p>
<p>149. In one of its first decisions, the Human Rights Council expressed &#8220;concern over the 
increasing trend of defamation of religions, incitement to racial and religious hatred and its 
recent manifestations&#8221; and requested its Special Rapporteurs on freedom of religion or belief and 
on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as 
well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to report on this phenomenon, 
in particular its implications for article 20, paragraph 2, of ICCPR.&#8221;<b>133</b> The relevant reports 
contain several important recommendations.<b>134</b> In this context, the report from a high level 
seminar on Internet and racism, organized by the Intergovernmental Working Group at its fourth 
session, which explored the impact of communication technologies on both dissemination and 
countering propaganda of racial hatred, racial violence, and xenophobia around the world, needs 
also to be mentioned.<b>135</b> All of the reports referred to above highlight the importance of 
multicultural education, including education on the Internet, aimed at promoting understanding, 
tolerance, peace and friendly relations between communities and nations. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>150. The experts are convinced that the implementation of national legislation harmonised with 
human rights treaty obligations could serve effectively to prevent, monitor and sanction acts of 
incitement to racial and religious hatred and the dissemination of hate speech. Effective 
cooperation between Governments, NGOs and civil society-based organizations in the 
identification of good practices could help curb both incitement and dissemination. Practical 
initiatives could include the creation of a model anti-racism network for educational institutions; 
the inclusion of anti-racism messages on websites accessed by young people; training courses for

<p>teachers on the use of the Internet; the sharing of good practices; the promotion of digital 
inclusion; the ethical use of the Internet; and the development of critical thinking skills for 
children. 
</p>
<p>151. It goes without saying that particular attention should be paid to the Internet because of its 
outreach and the decentralized nature of its architecture. The emerging approach of 
self-regulatory governance of the Internet offers an important opportunity that needs to be further 
explored. This could prove to be most effective in tackling incitement to racial and religious 
hatred and the dissemination of hate speech through this medium. States should continue the 
dialogue on this subject as it will lead to political agreement on how to prevent the Internet from 
being used for racist purposes and how to promote its use to combat racism. 
</p>
<p>152. In addressing the underlying question as to whether there is a gap in international human 
rights law pertaining to combating incitement to racial and religious hatred and the dissemination 
of hate speech, the experts discern a gap in application and consider that while there are 
provisions from various treaties addressing the issue, further guidance from treaty bodies as to 
the interpretative scope of these provisions and their threshold of application would be most 
useful. </p>

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>QUESTIONNAIRE  
 ON COMPLEMENTARY STANDARDS ON RACISM,  
 RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA AND  
  RELATED INTOLERANCE 
</b></p>
<p> In the follow-up to the recommendations of the 2001 World Conference against racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Intergovernmental Working Group 
on the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
established by Commission on Human Rights (resolution 2002/68), has addressed at its 
meetings the issue of the relevant complementary normative standards. On its initiative, a 
High Level Expert Seminar on complementary international standards was organized on 
16 - 20 January 2006 (see the report of the Working Group E/CN.4/2006/18 at www.ohchr.org). 
</p>
<p> In its conclusions from the seminar, the Working Group <i>inter alia </i>considered three 
directions of action that could be additionally instrumental in countering racism and xenophobia 
through means of law, namely, by: 
</p>
<p> (a) More effective application of the existing relevant human rights standards at the 
national and international levels; 
</p>
<p> (b) Identifying substantive gaps in binding international law and filling them by 
appropriate means; 
</p>
<p> (c) Identifying gaps in relevant procedures established by international law and 
introducing complementary solutions in this area. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group specifically concluded that &#8220;a successful strategy to combat racism 
and racial discrimination on a global scale, should direct relevant attention to the need to 
reinforce the implementation of existing international instruments and the elaboration of 
complementary international standards to address substantive and procedural gaps in those 
instruments.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Following on the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations, the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 1/5 (30 June 2006) requested a Group of five Experts and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination to prepare studies, on substantive and procedural issues 
respectively, for the discussion on complementary standards at the fifth session of the Working 
Group. The selection of the Group of Experts has been entrusted to the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p> According to the HRC resolution, the Group of Experts: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; [should] &#8220;study the content and scope of the substantive gaps in the existing 
international instruments to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, including but being not limited to the areas identified in the 
conclusions of the Chair of the high-level seminar that took place during the fourth 
session of the Intergovernmental Working Group,&#8221; and </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/WG.3/6 
 page 47 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;in consultation with human rights treaty bodies, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, and other relevant mandate-holders, should produce a base document that 
contains concrete recommendations on the means or avenues to bridge these gaps, 
including but not limited to the drafting of a new optional protocol to the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination or the adoption of 
new instruments such as conventions or declarations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The purpose of this questionnaire is to facilitate the study by the Group of Experts. The 
questionnaire has been formulated on the basis of the existing documents, in particular the 
outcome of the High Level Seminar on complementary international standards, including 
conclusions of the Chairperson and of the Working Group (see the aforementioned report of the 
Working Group), as well as the discussions among the Experts.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> Hence, the questionnaire has been developed around four basic areas: 1) manifestations of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 2) the protection of victims of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,<b> </b>3) responsibilities (positive 
obligations), 4) means and avenues to address possible substantive gaps in international law. 
</p>
<p> The stakeholders participating in this exercise are kindly requested to focus on areas of 
their particular expertise and experience. In order to facilitate the formulation of contributions, 
the Experts are open to receiving replies that cover areas IV (means and avenues) with the 
responses to the previous areas or to respond to the area IV separately. </p>
