JUNE 2016 QUARTERLY REPORT

The Board of Salt Lake Potash Limited {the Company or Salt Lake) is pleased to present its

quarterly report for the period ending 30 June 2016.

Highlights:

3» Initial test pumping of the paleochannel and surface aquifers at the Lake Wells Sulphate of
Potash (SOP) Project returned very encouraging results.

3» The test pumping provided aquifer permeability measurements within or exceeding the
expected range for the paleochannel and surface aquifers, demonstrating the potential to draw
very substantial brine flows from both the paleochannel and surface aquifers.

S» An extensive geophysical survey was completed, including gravity and passive seismic
programs focused on paleochannel mapping and aquifer modelling.

S» An aircore drilling program commenced at Lake Wells, aimed atpaleochannel targets identiﬁed
by the geophysical work.

3» The first hole in the aircore program was completed during the quarter, encountering a thick
paleochannel aquifer unit and providing initial conﬁrmation of geophysical modelling.

3» Particle size distribution analysis of the paleochannel aquifer unit sediments (comprising
sands, grave/s and cobbles) indicates potentially high permeability.

F» The second heritage clearance survey at the Lake Wells Project was completed, with
Aboriginal Heritage Consultants conﬁrming the proposed drilling and resource evaluation
program.

3» The Company and its consultants have substantially advanced the Lake Wells Project Scoping
Study, with completion expected in the coming weeks.

3» Signiﬁcant progress was made in the understanding of potential brine processing and SOP
production pathways, with leading international industry experts conducting a site visit to Lake
Wells.

3» The Company placed 27.8 million shares to a range of sophisticated and institutional investors
in Australia and Overseas, raising a total of $8.9 million (before costs).

EXPLORATION
Test Pumping
Drilling and test pumping of aircore and selected mud rotary holes at a number of sites on the lake
continued during the quarter. The objective of the program was to make an initial assessment of the
permeability and other characteristics of the brine aquifers at the Lake Wells Project.
The results of the test pumping provided aquifer permeability measurements within or exceeding the
expected range for the two aquifers tested. The paleochannel aquifer and one of the surface aquifer
test production bores were pumped at 4 litres per second (Ils), which was the maximum capacity of
the pump as constrained by the borehole diameter. Based on aquifer response considerably higher
pumping rates would be achieved with a larger capacity pump.

Paleochannel Aguifer
The Paleochannel Aquifer at Lake Wells was encountered in two aircore holes approximately 2km
apart drilled in late 2015. Paleochannel aquifers are a common feature of Australian paleochannel
environments and are intepreted to be extensive in the Lake Wells paleovalley. The coarse sands
and gravels at the depths of the paleochannel are potentially a very productive source of feed brine
because of high permeability in sediments deposited in the early, high energy paleo-environment.
A 2015 aircore hole drilled in the northern arm of Lake Wells, intersected fine paleochannel sands
with interbedded clays from 105m to 120m, with a band of noticeably coarser sands and gravels in
the deepest 4—5m. In the current campaign, a 150mm mud rotary hole LWBT001 (refer to Figure 2
below) was drilled to the same depth approximately 10m from the earlier aircore hole.

Figure 2: Location of Completed Pump Test Bore Holes
The hole was cased with 100mm PVC casing above the paleochannel aquifer and slotted 100mm
PVC casing through the paleochannel aquifer (105-120m), the bore annulus was gravel packed and
grouted. After bore development, a 100mm 4KW submersible pump was set at approximately 50m
below ground level. Test pumping comprised a step test where the bore was pumped at increasing
flow rates until the capacity of the pump was reached at approximately 4|/s. At this rate the water
level in the bore was lowered and maintained at 37m below ground level.
Using the standard Cooper-Jacob (1946) method, the pumping data was analysed and modelled to
estimate aquifer transmissivity of 8m2 per day, equating to bulk average permeability of 0.5m per
day at this site.

P 0 T A S H L T D
lmportantly, particle size distribution analysis for samples from this part of the paleochannel aquifer
record much coarser sands in the lower part of the aquifer, from 116-120m. This indicates that there
is much higher permeability in the lower part of the aquifer, rather than the finer sands higher in the
unit, where substantial clay is also present. Based on the particle size distribution analysis,
permeability in the 1 16-120m inten/al equated to 2—3m per day. This is particularly encouraging given
the current understanding of the geological setting is that the hole is located on the flank of the
paleochannel and the deepest part of the channel is a few hundred metres north of LWTBOO1.
Surface Aguifer
The Playa Lake Sediment (PLS) hosted aquifer at the surface of the Lake is a potential source of
feed brine from either or both of surface trenching or shallow bores. The PLS exhibits a wide range
of lithology, with variably sorted, fine grained clays, silts and sands, including gypsum crystals and
silcrete which influence the porosity and permeability of the sediments.
A shallow aircore drill hole in late 2015 in the Northern arm of the Lake encountered PLS and a band
of crystalline silcrete from approximately 5-13m, which exhibited excellent brine ﬂow during airlifting.
In the current campaign, a 24m mud rotary hole LWBTOO7 was drilled adjacent to the air core hole.
The hole was cased and gravel packed, with slotted PVC from 6m to 20m. A 100mm 4KW
submersible pump was installed 15m below ground level and a constant ﬂow rate test was run for
24 hours at 6|/s. Drawdown was stable at 1.8m, before the failure of the pump generator terminated
testing. Prior to the constant rate flow test an initial trial pumping reached the capacity of the pump.
Modelling of the pumping test using the standard Cooper-Jacob (1946) method produced an aquifer
transmissivity of 3400m2 per day, equating to bulk average permeability of 240m per day for this site.
This exceptional result is partly due to the enhanced secondary porosity developed within the silcrete
zone. The extent of the silcrete zone has not been defined by the two holes drilled.
An additional mud rotary hole LWBTOO4 was drilled to 21m and adjacent to the location of a 2015
aircore hole which intersected interbedded clays, sands and silts from surface to the targeted depth.
The pump test was conducted on an inten/al from 1m to 21m as per the procedures described for
LWBT007, with the equivalent calculation method producing a transmissivity of 4m2 per day,
equating to bulk average permeability of 0.2m per day.
Fractured Siltstone Aguifer
The majority of drill holes completed during the aircore drill program in 2015 ended in a fractured
bedrock brine yielding aquifer, which was deﬁned as the Fractured siltstone Aquifer (FSA). The
upper part of the formation yielded water at variable rates for these drill holes demonstrating elevated
permeability. The permeability of this unit is likely to be associated with weathering and fracturing of
the rock matrix. Where fractured, the rock is expected to act as an aquifer. The siltstone aquifer and
brine pool potentially continues some depth below the range of the aircore drill program.
During the 2015 program aircore hole LWA009 intersected shallow fractured and weathered
Proterozoic siltstone from 11 to 63m below ground level (m bgl) where the hole was terminated due
to refusal. Airlift yields of between 0.2 to 0.3 l/s were recorded from 42 to 63m bgl and showed a
general increase with depth indicating the potential for productive fracture zones beyond 63m.
In 2016, a Mud rotary hole LWBT002 was located adjacent to LWA009 in the “Neck” area of Lake
Wells and drilled to 99m. Results oftest pumping indicated a transmissivity of 16m2 per day, equating
to bulk average permeability of 0.3m per day, from an interval of 20m to 775m. Further exploration
to define structural controls and identify more highly fractured zones will be undertaken to determine
additional drilling and test pumping targets in the FSA.

Test Pumping Program Brine Sampling Results
Brine samples were obtained at regular intervals during test pumping. Brine analysis has been
completed on the samples collected to date from each of the test pumped aquifers as presented in
Table 1 below. The SOP grade of the samples range from 8.56kg/m3 to 10.09kg/m3, with an average
of 9.47kg/m3. Samples collected from the two surface aquifer tests exhibit a slightly higher grade
SOP compared with the paleochannel aquifer. The brine analysis results are consistent over the
duration of each test, and with the corresponding samples collected from adjacent aircore holes
during the 2015 aircore drilling program.

Completion of Detailed Geophysical Survey
An extensive ground based geophysical survey was completed in the quarter aimed at assessing
the Lake Wells bedrock topography and generation of aquifer drill targets. Atlas Geophysics were
engaged to undertake a gravity sun/ey using industw leading high accuracy gravimeters and position
systems to measure subsurface density. A total of 46 gravity lines comprising 2,147 stations spaced
50 — 200m apart (see Figure 3) were completed. In addition, a low impact high-resolution passive
seismic system was used to correlate a secondaw geophysical interpretation tool with the gravity
and provide a more robust model. A total of 11 passive seismic lines spanning 30km was completed
on priority lines identified by the gravity sun/ey. Interpretation and modelling of the geophysical
survey data is ongoing.

Aircore Drilling Program
A truck mounted air-core drill rig was mobilized to the northern end of the Lake during the quarter.
A program of 5-10 holes to 120m is planned to validate the geophysical modeling and test potential
palaeochannel aquifer targets identified by geophysical surveys. The first hole in the program,
LWA030, was located approximately 3km from the northernmost point of Lake Wells (see Figure
2). The hole encountered a highly permeable silcrete aquifer of brackish water from 9m to 21m
followed by a sequence of paleovalley clays from 21 m to 95m. A paleochannel aquifer comprising
fine to coarse sands, gravels and cobbles from approximately 95m to 107m was encountered. The
hole ended in cobbles which the aircore failed to penetrate. Airlift water flows of up to 9lls were
recorded in this zone, as well as considerable sub-artesian water pressure.

Table 2: Brine Analysis Results
Samples of coarse sands and gravels which were collected from intervals from 95 to 96m, and 100
to 107m, were submitted for Particle Size Distribution (PSD) analysis. These zones have theoretical
permeability ranging from 0.01 to 66m/d. The balance of the sampled interval includes some sands
and clays which bring the average permeability down to approximately 17m/d. This equates to a
Transmissivity of approximately 136m2/day over the sampled interval, indicating potentially high
water flows in this part of the aquifer. The results of the PSD analysis are presented in Figure 4
below, where high permeability zones relate to more well sorted coarse grained sediments.
