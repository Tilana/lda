</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 12/2 of 1 October 2009 and 22/6

</p>
<p>  
 * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, 
and taking note with appreciation of the summary thereof,1 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> <i>also </i>the different roles played by the Secretary-General, the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the President of the Human Rights 
Council in addressing, including in a public manner, acts of intimidation or reprisals against 
individuals and groups who cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> <i>further </i>the work done by special procedures, individually or jointly, and 
the increased attention given by treaty bodies to preventing and addressing intimidation and 
reprisals, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> at the continued reports of intimidation and reprisals against 
individuals and groups who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, 
its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, and at the seriousness of 
reported reprisals, including violations of the right of the victim to life, liberty and security 
of person, and violations of obligations under international law prohibiting torture and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that acts of intimidation or reprisals carried out or tolerated by the 
State undermine and often violate human rights, and underscoring that States should 
investigate any alleged act of intimidation or reprisal, ensure accountability and effective 
remedies and take steps to prevent further intimidation and reprisals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles), and underlining the role 
that national human rights institutions can play in preventing and addressing cases of 
reprisal as part of supporting cooperation between their Governments and the United 
Nations in the promotion of human rights, including by contributing to follow-up actions, 
as appropriate, to recommendations made by international human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
to unhindered access to and communication with international bodies, in particular the 
United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, including 
the Human Rights Council, its special procedures, the universal periodic review mechanism 
and treaty bodies, as well as regional human rights mechanisms, bearing in mind that free 
and unhindered access to and communication with individuals and civil society are indeed 
indispensable to enable the United Nations and its mechanisms to fulfil their mandates; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Strongly calls upon</i> all States to review legislation, policies and practices that 
have the effect of undermining unhindered access to and communication with international 
bodies as set forth in paragraph 1 above and to avoid adopting any such new legislation; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> all States to prevent and refrain from all acts of intimidation or reprisal 
against those who:

testimony or information to them; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Avail or have availed themselves of procedures established under the 
auspices of the United Nations for the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to them for this 
purpose; 
</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Submit or have submitted communications under procedures established by 
human rights instruments, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to them 
for this purpose; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Are relatives of victims of human rights violations or of those who have 
provided legal or other assistance to victims; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> States to take all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of 
intimidation or reprisals, including, where necessary, by adopting and consequently 
implementing specific legislation and policies and by issuing appropriate guidance to 
national authorities in order to effectively protect those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or 
have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of 
human rights from any act of intimidation or reprisal; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also urges</i> States to ensure accountability for any acts of intimidation or 
reprisal against those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights by ensuring 
impartial, prompt and thorough investigations of any alleged acts of intimidation or reprisal 
in order to bring the perpetrators to justice; to provide access to effective remedies for 
victims in accordance with their international human rights obligations and commitments; 
and to prevent any recurrence; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages</i> States to provide information, as appropriate, to the Human 
Rights Council  on all measures taken to prevent and address acts of intimidation or reprisal 
against those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, 
its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, including on cases 
mentioned in the reports of the Secretary-General; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States, when electing members to the Human Rights Council, to take 
into account that Council members should uphold the highest standards in the promotion 
and protection of human rights and fully cooperate with the Council, in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, to designate, within the existing structures, a United 
Nations-wide senior focal point to engage with all stakeholders, in particular Member 
States, to promote the prevention of, protection against and accountability for reprisals and 
intimidation related to cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms, and to encourage a prompt and effective unified response to such acts by 
sensitizing the United Nations system as a whole by facilitating cooperation and 
coordination among all stakeholders, with the overall objective of supporting and 
promoting cooperation with the United Nations in the field of human rights, including 
cooperation with civil society;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages</i> States to address acts of intimidation and reprisals against 
individuals and groups who cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights by considering, inter alia, the 
establishment of a national focal point; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Invites</i> the Secretary-General to include, in his next annual report on 
cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of 
human rights, information on the activities of the United Nations-wide senior focal point, 
the different measures hampering cooperation with United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, and best practices of international, regional and national human rights bodies 
and institutions that address cases of intimidation or reprisals against those cooperating 
with them; </p>


<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> all stakeholders, including international and regional 
organizations, Member States, national human rights institutions, civil society and 
academic institutions, to contribute to the future consideration of this issue by the Human 
Rights Council by, inter alia, convening expert workshops on the issue of legislation, 
policies and practices that effectively protect those who seek to, cooperate or have 
cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of 
human rights from acts of intimidation or reprisals; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> all representatives and mechanisms of the United Nations to 
continue to include in their respective reports to the Human Rights Council or to the 
General Assembly a reference to credible allegations of intimidation or reprisal against 
those who seek to cooperate, cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, as well as an account of action 
they have taken in this regard.
