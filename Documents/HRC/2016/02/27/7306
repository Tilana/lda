<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction and background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The endorsement of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(hereinafter, the Guiding Principles)2 by the Human Rights Council in June 2011 in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 17/4  represented a milestone in global efforts to close governance gaps between 
</p>
<p>the scope and impact of economic actors and the capacity of society to manage their 
</p>
<p>adverse impacts. This provided for the first time a United Nations-backed framework to 
</p>
<p>define the respective duties and responsibilities of Governments and business enterprises 
</p>
<p>for preventing and addressing adverse human rights impacts arising from business 
</p>
<p>activities. In order to advance the Guiding Principles, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>established the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations 
</p>
<p>and other business enterprises with a mandate to promote the dissemination and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles worldwide.3 
</p>
<p>2. As part of its efforts to engage a wider set of actors, the Working Group decided in 
</p>
<p>November 2012 to organize regional forums to complement the annual Forum on Business 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights.
4
 Such regional forums would seek to enable more direct engagement 
</p>
<p>with stakeholders charged with putting the three pillars of the Guiding Principles into 
</p>
<p>practice &#8220;on the ground&#8221;, including Government institutions, national business associations, 
</p>
<p>business enterprises with a regional and domestic reach, national and local civil society 
</p>
<p>groups, and regional organizations and mechanisms. The first regional forum, for the Latin 
</p>
<p>America and the Caribbean region, was held from 28 to 30 August 2013 in Medell&#237;n, 
</p>
<p>Colombia.
5
 
</p>
<p>3. In June 2014, in its resolution 26/22, the Human Rights Council welcomed the work 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group in the fulfilment of its mandate, including the convening of regional 
</p>
<p>forums to discuss challenges and lessons learned from the implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles with States and other stakeholders in a regional context. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The African Regional Forum 
</b></p>
<p>4. The African Regional Forum on Business and Human Rights was held in Addis 
</p>
<p>Ababa, from 16 to 18 September 2014. It was convened by the Working Group with the 
</p>
<p>support of the African Union Commission&#8217;s Department of Political Affairs, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Programme and the United Nations Global Compact also assisted with the organization of 
</p>
<p>the event.  
</p>
<p>5. The regional forum aimed to promote multi-stakeholder dialogue and cooperation on 
</p>
<p>business and human rights and the implementation of the Guiding Principles in Africa, with 
</p>
<p>a view to: (a) advancing the business and human rights agenda in the region and promoting 
</p>
<p>progress with regard to all three pillars of the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and 
</p>
<p>Remedy&#8221; Framework; (b) identifying regional implementation experiences, challenges and 
</p>
<p>opportunities; (c) identifying opportunities for embedding the Guiding Principles in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 The Guiding Principles are contained in the annex to document A/HRC/17/31.

</p>
<p>regional and subregional governance frameworks, and exploring the synergies between the 
</p>
<p>Working Group&#8217;s mandate and the work of regional and subregional African institutions 
</p>
<p>and mechanisms; (d) identifying linkages between the business and human rights and 
</p>
<p>sustainable development agendas from a regional perspective; and (e) promoting and 
</p>
<p>supporting capacity-building opportunities in relation to the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>6. The forum was open to all relevant stakeholders, including Governments, 
</p>
<p>international and regional bodies, global, regional and domestic business, industry 
</p>
<p>associations, trade unions, affected persons and community members, civil society, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, the United Nations and other international organizations. 
</p>
<p>Approximately 200 individuals from all the stakeholder groups participated, which included 
</p>
<p>participants travelling from some 30 African countries. In addition, several diplomatic 
</p>
<p>missions based in Addis Ababa attended.  
</p>
<p>7. The event featured 12 official panel sessions and seven side events over three days.6 
</p>
<p>Side events addressed both general and more specialized aspects concerning 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles. The official plenary and parallel sessions 
</p>
<p>focused on ways to advance implementation of the Guiding Principles across Africa, 
</p>
<p>including by enhancing access to remedy for business-related human rights abuse, sector-
</p>
<p>specific trends and challenges (respectively in the extractive sector and in land investment), 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by African business in implementing the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights, building an African strategy on business and human rights, the 
</p>
<p>importance of national action plans to implement the Guiding Principles and, in particular, 
</p>
<p>the challenges and roles of national human rights institutions and human rights defenders in 
</p>
<p>promoting corporate accountability. The human rights issues featured on the forum&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>agenda reflected inputs solicited by the Working Group in its pre-consultations with 
</p>
<p>stakeholder groups.7 
</p>
<p><b> III. </b>A vision for implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, 
<b>Respect and </b>Remedy&#8221; Framework across Africa<b>  
</b></p>
<p>8. During the high-level opening session, aimed at setting out a vision for 
</p>
<p>implementing the Guiding Principles in the region, all speakers acknowledged the 
</p>
<p>importance of the regional forum, emphasizing its role of fostering multi-stakeholder 
</p>
<p>dialogue and advancing the business and human rights agenda in Africa. They also referred 
</p>
<p>to the importance of the Guiding Principles and called for joint efforts to promote their 
</p>
<p>implementation in the region.  
</p>
<p>9. The representative of the Working Group stressed that the Guiding Principles served 
</p>
<p>as the key reference point for global efforts to strengthen the protection of human rights in 
</p>
<p>the context of business activities, highlighting that they were not &#8220;voluntary&#8221; guidelines but 
</p>
<p>grounded in legally binding norms and standards and provide authoritative guidance on the 
</p>
<p>application of existing core international human rights treaties in that area. All African 
</p>
<p>States were encouraged to initiate inclusive multi-stakeholder processes to develop national 
</p>
<p>action plans on business and human rights. Steps taken to initiate such processes in the 
</p>

 Summaries of the side events and the names of panel speakers are included in the appendix to the 
</p>
<p>present report. The African Union Commission and the European Union also jointly organized a 
</p>
<p>seminar on business and human rights on the margins of the regional forum (see

</b></p>
<p>region, including in Ghana, Morocco, Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania, 
</p>
<p>were welcomed.  
</p>
<p>10. In highlighting some of the human rights issues facing the continent, a representative 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group called strongly for multi-stakeholder dialogue and cooperation, 
</p>
<p>noting that it was only through a dialogue between all parties &#8212; States, business 
</p>
<p>enterprises, national human rights institutions, civil society and affected communities &#8212; 
</p>
<p>that effective solutions could be found.  
</p>
<p>11. The representative of the African Union Commission noted that African leaders 
</p>
<p>agreed that business and human rights is a crucial issue. Attention was drawn to the 2011 
</p>
<p>African Union human rights strategy for Africa, which sought to address the current 
</p>
<p>challenges facing the African human rights system in ensuring effective promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights on the continent. Additional steps that had been taken with 
</p>
<p>regard to business and human rights specifically were also highlighted, including: (a) 
</p>
<p>creation of the African Commission&#8217;s Working Group on Extractive Industries, 
</p>
<p>Environment and Human Rights Violations; (b) development of the African Mining Vision; 
</p>
<p>and (c) strong advocacy by many national human rights institutions on the continent 
</p>
<p>regarding business and human rights issues, based on the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>12. The representative of the African Union Commission reiterated its commitment to 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles and the development of an African framework on business and 
</p>
<p>human rights based on the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>13. The representative of UNECA said that the protection of human rights was 
</p>
<p>compatible with business, and that there was a need for a human rights-based approach to 
</p>
<p>development, as a crucial part of the post-2015 agenda. It was underlined that there was a 
</p>
<p>need for a common African position on how business could be most beneficial for human 
</p>
<p>rights and that the Guiding Principles was a vital document in that regard, as the pursuit of 
</p>
<p>human rights was a social and economic necessity for inclusive and sustainable 
</p>
<p>development and cohesive societies. 
</p>
<p>14. The representative of the Government of Ethiopia emphasized that, in the efforts of 
</p>
<p>the continent to lift millions out of poverty through economic development, human rights 
</p>
<p>needed to be protected by both Governments and the private sector.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Identifying key business and human rights challenges 
and opportunities across the continent 
</b></p>
<p>15. A central aim of the regional forum was to identify some of the main business and 
</p>
<p>human rights issues in Africa and discuss how various stakeholders could address them by 
</p>
<p>applying the Guiding Principles. Perspectives on the state of play and opportunities for the 
</p>
<p>way forward were shared by different actors. 
</p>
<p>16. The representative of the International Labour Organization (ILO) welcomed the 
</p>
<p>African Union&#8217;s interest in the issue and stressed that the contextualization of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles was crucial, including through the development of national action plans. The 
</p>
<p>need for coordination among African Governments was underlined and the key importance 
</p>
<p>for African States to sign, ratify and implement the ILO conventions, in particular the eight 
</p>
<p>ILO core conventions, noted. The progress seen with regard to the application of the ILO 
</p>
<p>conventions in Africa was welcomed and the positive trend of decreased use of child labour 
</p>
<p>was noted. The need to focus on groups that were particularly vulnerable, such as women, 
</p>
<p>migrants or domestic workers, was also highlighted. 
</p>
<p>17. A representative of Business Africa, representing the perspective of African 
</p>
<p>employers&#8217; federations, underlined the need to encourage all stakeholders to commit to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>reducing adverse human rights impacts by companies on the ground. With regard to human 
</p>
<p>rights challenges on the continent, it was noted that they differed widely across countries, 
</p>
<p>but problems such as weak governance, the legacy of colonialism, ethnic tensions or 
</p>
<p>poverty were relevant in most parts of Africa. Governments were called upon to do much 
</p>
<p>more, including: (a) strengthening public governance and legal systems to ensure redress, 
</p>
<p>noting that the implementation of the Guiding Principles crucially required rule of law and 
</p>
<p>that weak judicial systems were a major problem; (b) addressing the challenge of the 
</p>
<p>informal sector and facilitating transition to formality; and (c) developing national action 
</p>
<p>plans to implement the Guiding Principles, which should be done in close consultation with 
</p>
<p>business.  
</p>
<p>18. Another point raised was the need for better dialogue between Western and African 
</p>
<p>Governments, as well as international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Such 
</p>
<p>dialogue was necessary to help African States avoid the negative impacts of regulation 
</p>
<p>introduced by States in the West, examples being the conflict minerals reporting 
</p>
<p>requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of the 
</p>
<p>United States of America and reported negative impacts for people on the ground in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>19. The discussion also featured an example to highlight the value of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles as a tool for enhancing multi-stakeholder dialogue: a project called &#8220;pillars in 
</p>
<p>practice&#8221; where the Guiding Principles had been applied by an NGO in the mining sector in 
</p>
<p>Zimbabwe to address adverse human rights impacts arising from extractive operations. The 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles had provided a helpful platform for engagement in many ways, 
</p>
<p>including by: enabling a more constructive engagement with the Government and business; 
</p>
<p>and providing an authoritative framework defining the duties and responsibilities of the 
</p>
<p>Government and companies. 
</p>
<p>20. However, it was noted that, despite the progress, there was still mistrust and hostility 
</p>
<p>from business and Governments towards civil society and collaboration needed to improve.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Preventing and addressing adverse human rights impacts 
in the extractive industries: challenges, opportunities 
and current practice 
</b></p>
<p>21. Human rights challenges in the extractive sector had been identified as a key issue 
</p>
<p>for the regional forum and, during multi-stakeholder discussions, participants sought to 
</p>
<p>shed further light on those challenges, as well as innovations in corporate practice, public 
</p>
<p>policy and civil society advocacy.  
</p>
<p>22. The work of the African Minerals Development Centre to support implementation of 
</p>
<p>the African Mining Vision was highlighted. That framework, adopted by the African Union 
</p>
<p>Heads of State and Government in February 2009, establishes that the extraction of mineral 
</p>
<p>resources on the continent should be in accordance with labour standards and respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>23. An important development cited was the establishment of the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Extractive Industries, Environment and Human Rights Violations of the African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in 2009 with a mandate to examine the impact 
</p>
<p>of the extractive industries in the light of the African Charter, to research specific issues 
</p>
<p>and to inform the Commission of potential steps to take. The issues that the Commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>working group was examining included: (a) inadequate mechanisms used by companies to 
</p>
<p>engage communities, often made in a &#8220;tick-the-box&#8221; manner without the possibility for the 
</p>
<p>community to bring alternatives to the table; (b) environmental impact assessments that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>frequently did not reflect the requirements set by relevant laws and standards; (c) the effect 
</p>
<p>of extractive industries on access to land; (c) lack of coherence within Governments; (d) 
</p>
<p>access to remedy; and (e) free prior and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>24. Experiences were shared by the Government of Ghana. It was noted that the country 
</p>
<p>was benefiting significantly from mining, but there was serious environmental and social 
</p>
<p>damage occurring, such as water pollution, destruction of land, community resettlement and 
</p>
<p>concerns related to noise from project sites. Examples of how the Government was seeking 
</p>
<p>to address those issues included: mechanisms to ensure adequate compensation for people 
</p>
<p>who needed to be resettled; efforts to strengthen communication between mining 
</p>
<p>companies and communities; and adherence to the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>25. With reference to experiences of advocacy relating to a World Bank-financed 
</p>
<p>project in the extractive sector in Chad, it was observed that, in a context where there was a 
</p>
<p>relative absence of Government, civil society took over the role of trying to protect people 
</p>
<p>from negative impacts. However, civil society actors faced a number of challenges related 
</p>
<p>to: (a) lack of democracy and possibilities for political participation; (b) lack of access to 
</p>
<p>education; (c) impunity of those in power; asymmetric power relations and government-
</p>
<p>business collusion; and (d) lack of effective avenues for access to justice. 
</p>
<p>26. A participant from a major mining corporation noted that respecting the rights of 
</p>
<p>communities was the right thing to do, but that there was also a &#8220;business case&#8221; for it. 
</p>
<p>Among the challenges experienced by that corporation in implementing the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles, the following were noted: migration issues &#8212; mining projects attracting people 
</p>
<p>and the influx of people bringing social problems; security at the project site and the 
</p>
<p>question of what capacities and instruments could be given to private security providers; 
</p>
<p>and Governments that failed to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>27. An industry-based multi-stakeholder initiative with a specific business and human 
</p>
<p>rights focus was presented at the forum as one possible model for overcoming challenges. 
</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;Nairobi Process&#8221; aimed to embed the Guiding Principles in the oil and gas 
</p>
<p>sector in East Africa and included three main work areas: creating knowledge &#8212; gaining 
</p>
<p>understanding of human rights risks; capacity-building &#8212; informing and training 
</p>
<p>stakeholders; and establishing a space for dialogue with Government, civil society and 
</p>
<p>companies. 
</p>
<p>28. Research showed that the oil and gas sector in East Africa (which consisted mainly 
</p>
<p>of small and medium-sized companies) had both positive and negative impacts: positive &#8212; 
</p>
<p>creation of livelihood opportunities, some support for education and sometimes improved 
</p>
<p>access to water; negative &#8212; inadequate information causing conflicts with communities, 
</p>
<p>lack of sustainability of the investment and non-respect of community land rights.  
</p>
<p>29. Several other aspects relating to the oil and gas sector were addressed during the 
</p>
<p>Forum, including: (a) the need for companies to respect human rights regardless of how 
</p>
<p>Governments were meeting their respective duties; (b) the frequent failure to engage and 
</p>
<p>informing communities before decisions about licensing were made; (c) community 
</p>

<p><b> VI. Discussions on access to remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Multi-stakeholder consultation on enhancing access to judicial remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b>for corporate involvement in human rights impacts 
</b></p>
<p>30. The aim of the session was to seek input from African experts and stakeholders for a 
</p>
<p>consultative process led by OHCHR, in cooperation with the Working Group, pursuant to 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 26/22, which requested OHCHR to facilitate the sharing 
</p>
<p>and exploration of the full range of legal options and practical measures to improve access 
</p>
<p>to remedy for victims of business-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>31. It was stressed that access to effective remedies for victims of human rights abuse 
</p>
<p>was a critical component of any legal system and of all the core international human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties. It was also a central component of the Guiding Principles and the third pillar on 
</p>
<p>access to effective remedy.  
</p>
<p>32. As part of the project it was leading on enhancing accountability and access to 
</p>
<p>remedy in cases of business involvement in human rights abuses, OHCHR had 
</p>
<p>commissioned a study on corporate liability for gross human rights abuses and ways to 
</p>
<p>move towards a fairer and more effective system of domestic law remedies. In brief, the 
</p>
<p>study, which examined a number of jurisdictions, found that:
8
  
</p>
<p>(a) The expanding net of liability was not yet translating into an effective system 
</p>
<p>of remedies in practice; 
</p>
<p>(b) The current tendency of litigants to favour action in foreign courts was costly 
</p>
<p>and inefficient and might have adverse consequences in the longer term; 
</p>
<p>(c) There were uneven levels of legal protection and inequalities in the ability of 
</p>
<p>victims to access justice; 
</p>
<p>(d) There was currently a lack of legal certainty for both victims and companies; 
</p>
<p>(e) There was lack of a level playing field for companies. 
</p>
<p>33. The ongoing consultative multi-stakeholder process was addressing several aspects, 
</p>
<p>including: 
</p>
<p>(a) Clarification of the various tests for corporate liability currently applied in 
</p>
<p>different jurisdictions; 
</p>
<p>(b) Roles and responsibilities of interested States in relation to standard-setting 
</p>
<p>and enforcement; 
</p>
<p>(c) Identification of good State practice in relation to three key areas of focus: 
</p>
<p>(i) Funding for legal claims; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Criminal law sanctions (corporate legal responsibility, innovative 
</p>
<p>practice in different jurisdictions); 
</p>
<p>(iii) Civil law remedies; 
</p>
<p>(d) The practice of domestic prosecution bodies (why cases were not taken up 
</p>
<p>even if the domestic institution was in place).

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>34. Forum participants heard from a person affected by the 2004 Kilwa massacre in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, in which a mining company had provided logistical 
</p>
<p>support to security forces that committed the violations. That personal account 
</p>
<p>demonstrated the stark reality faced by victims seeking access to remedy. Efforts to seek 
</p>
<p>justice both in domestic courts and abroad had failed to bring results, even 10 years after 
</p>
<p>the event. It was noted how litigation in Canada against the implicated company domiciled 
</p>
<p>there had first seemed to be possible as the Supreme Court had accepted the case, but that 
</p>
<p>then the case was dismissed on grounds of a lack of jurisdiction. During the process, the 
</p>
<p>litigants had been informed that the mining company involved in the massacre had been 
</p>
<p>sold to another company. 
</p>
<p>35. Another perspective shared by a participant was on the experience of the national 
</p>
<p>human rights institution in Ghana and its function as a quasi-judicial mechanism. Several 
</p>
<p>challenges with regard to ensuring access to remedy for victims were highlighted, 
</p>
<p>including: (a) a lack of protection of human rights in investment law and failure by 
</p>
<p>involved ministries to take access to remedy for victims into account; (b) in spite of 
</p>
<p>regulation on the requirement and a procedure for compensation on land acquisition, a 
</p>
<p>general gap in access to judicial remedy; and (c) a lack of funding for legal aid. 
</p>
<p>36. Another key issue discussed was the need for capacity-building, including the role of 
</p>
<p>the State in ensuring capacity-building for communities and business. Participants called 
</p>
<p>for further clarification of the concept of company liability and complicity, as well as of the 
</p>
<p>criteria for company due diligence. With regard to the roles and responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>interested States in cross-border cases, it was suggested that host States would welcome the 
</p>
<p>support and cooperation of home States in cases of corporate involvement in gross human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>37. Civil society organizations involved in litigation also gave their perspectives during 
</p>
<p>the discussion on access to judicial remedy. One recommended that the approach of 
</p>
<p>strategic litigation in national courts should be tested further. It was suggested that bringing 
</p>
<p>selected cases to court would be a good way to promote legal reform, citing experience 
</p>
<p>from South Africa. It was noted that non-judicial remedy was also important, and that 
</p>
<p>stakeholders should try to make best use of the resources currently available within their 
</p>
<p>own jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p>38. Several challenges involved in bringing cases of corporate-related human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses to national courts were highlighted, including:  
</p>
<p>(a) In some jurisdictions, collective litigation was not accepted; 
</p>
<p>(b) Victims lacked financial support and legal assistance; 
</p>
<p>(c) There was a lack of capacity at community level: when human rights 
</p>
<p>violations occurred, the victims could not document the facts to bring a case to court; 
</p>
<p>(d) Companies could not be prosecuted in the host States due to weak 
</p>
<p>enforcement of the rule of law. At international level, it was also hard to get access to 
</p>
<p>remedy. Knowledge about the cost and process to bring cases to courts in other jurisdictions 
</p>
<p>was elusive; 
</p>
<p>(e) Lack of political will. 
</p>
<p>39. A representative of African employers&#8217; federations suggested that non-judicial 
</p>
<p>mechanisms had an important role to play in providing access to remedy, as they were often 
</p>
<p>less expensive and faster to use than judicial mechanisms. It was noted that, in some 
</p>
<p>countries, the lack of political will, of an independent judicial system, of financial support 
</p>
<p>and of a modern case-management system and the presence of corruption all undermined 
</p>
<p>trust in the judicial system. Suggestions for addressing those gaps included making an </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>effective national legal system a criterion for accessing international funds. The way 
</p>
<p>forward required action from Governments, but also increased awareness among companies 
</p>
<p>about the need to implement grievance mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>40. During the discussion on judicial remedy, participants also emphasized the 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by people living in poverty whose human rights were adversely affected 
</p>
<p>by business operations and the need to improve access to legal aid, the possibility of 
</p>
<p>utilizing existing mechanisms, such as consumer protection, and greater potential leverage 
</p>
<p>in cases involving listed companies as opposed to non-listed companies. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to non-judicial remedy: experiences and lessons from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>continent in ensuring access to remedy for affected stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b>through operational-level grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>41. The aim of the session was to examine lessons and experiences of operational-level 
</p>
<p>grievances mechanisms across African business operations and reflect on the challenges 
</p>
<p>and opportunities in aligning current practice with the criteria set out in the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles to ensure effective remedy outcomes.  
</p>
<p>42. A premise for the discussion was that operational-level grievance mechanisms could 
</p>
<p>have some advantages in certain circumstances, as they: could act as a system of early 
</p>
<p>warning and early response; provided a process of trust-building among different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders; and served as a mechanism to manage expectations of projects and facilitate 
</p>
<p>community engagement. 
</p>
<p>43. It was also pointed out that non-judicial mechanisms could fill some of the gaps 
</p>
<p>related to weak governance in some countries.  
</p>
<p>44. Participants from business suggested that non-judicial grievance mechanisms could 
</p>
<p>be fast and cost-effective, if they kicked in at an early stage, all parties were involved, the 
</p>
<p>expectations held by all parties were clear and the mechanisms were geared towards 
</p>
<p>preventing grievances. With reference to mechanisms such as the Organization for 
</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation and Development system of national contact points and industry-
</p>
<p>level systems, it was noted that such mechanisms could solve issues more quickly given the 
</p>
<p>use of industry knowledge and expertise. However, it was also underlined that such 
</p>
<p>mechanisms were only effective when people were aware of them and trusted them. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, a main challenge was a lack of resources and consistency. Moreover, it was stressed 
</p>
<p>that non-judicial remedy processes should not undermine judicial remedy, and that States 
</p>
<p>needed to provide a conducive legal environment to level the playing field. 
</p>
<p>45. Several NGOs gave their views. One NGO shared an example from Kenya, where 
</p>
<p>one company grievance mechanism had handled the issue of childcare needs among 
</p>
<p>workers. The company subsequently set up a childcare facility. It was noted that grievance 
</p>
<p>systems could help companies detect and mitigate problems. However, grievance 
</p>
<p>mechanisms also had limitations. For example, they could not deliver punishment for 
</p>
<p>serious abuses, and workers might be reluctant to use them from fear for losing their jobs. 
</p>
<p>With regard to conducive regulatory frameworks, the standard set by the Employment Act 
</p>
<p>in Kenya with regard to terminating contracts was referenced. It was suggested that it might 
</p>
<p>be helpful if a similar standard was used for operational-level grievance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>46. Another key issue underlined was the need for stakeholders to sit down together in 
</p>
<p>an impartial manner to solve issues. It was suggested that States should have a policy to 
</p>
<p>encourage legal remedy and promote grievance mechanisms at company level, and that 
</p>
<p>victims should have options to use all mechanism available. The mechanisms needed to 
</p>
<p>have clear timetables to be efficient and strategic.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>47. One participant highlighted the experience of promoting operational-level grievance 
</p>
<p>processes in Nigeria, arguing that each grievance mechanism needed to be tailored to the 
</p>
<p>respective project. Such mechanisms could facilitate early warning and early response, but 
</p>
<p>could not handle serious human rights violations, only smaller conflicts. Grievance 
</p>
<p>mechanisms could serve as a platform for building relationships between different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and a forum for dialogue, and help to manage the expectation of projects and 
</p>
<p>facilitate community engagement. The cost of grievance mechanisms should be budgeted 
</p>
<p>into the cost of projects, and Governments should encourage companies to have such 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and set standards.  
</p>
<p>48. A representative of the World Bank Group&#8217;s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>(CAO), which had been set up to receive complaints directly from people affected by 
</p>
<p>projects sponsored by the International Finance Corporation or the Multilateral Investment 
</p>
<p>Guarantee Agency, also took part in the discussion. It carried out dispute resolution, 
</p>
<p>assessing compliance with International Finance Corporation safeguards (which covered 
</p>
<p>elements of the second pillar of the Guiding Principles) and advising stakeholders. The 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman received complaints when grievance mechanisms at company level either 
</p>
<p>failed or did not exist and, in its experience, the problem was not a lack of human rights-
</p>
<p>related policies at company level, but rather a lack of implementation of existing policies. It 
</p>
<p>was noted that some problems could be solved through mediation and, as part of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman process, local institutions, local Government and local non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations could all play a role. 
</p>
<p>49. All participants stressed the need for joint stakeholder action and that the 
</p>
<p>operational-level grievance mechanisms should meet all criteria set out in the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles. It was recalled that the non-judicial remedy process should not undermine the 
</p>
<p>right of victims to access to judicial remedy. A key issue was how to ensure the 
</p>
<p>independence of and trust in operational-level mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Business and human rights in the African context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Integrating the corporate responsibility to respect human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>across African businesses: challenges and opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>50. The aim of the session was to identify key challenges and opportunities in 
</p>
<p>implementing the second pillar of Guiding Principles (the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights) in the operations of African-based business enterprises, as well as to 
</p>
<p>share emerging good practice to address human rights issues.  
</p>
<p>51. The discussion highlighted both the potential contribution of the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>and some critical challenges for the success of their uptake: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Guiding Principles could help companies do good business and become 
</p>
<p>good corporate citizens; 
</p>
<p>(b) In Africa, 80 per cent of companies were small and medium-sized enterprises 
</p>
<p>(SMEs), most of which lacked of awareness about responsible business and the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles; 
</p>
<p>(c) The issue of corruption led to problems in the implementation of laws.  
</p>
<p>52. Participants stressed that all stakeholders needed to be involved in addressing those 
</p>
<p>challenges and generating an environment which fostered business respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights, and that Governments had a particularly important role to play in bringing about 
</p>
<p>real, transformational change. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>53. The discussion also highlighted the emerging recognition that negative impacts on 
</p>
<p>human rights could also have negative impacts on economic success, which was prompting 
</p>
<p>shareholders to increasingly raise questions about human rights issues. As a consequence, it 
</p>
<p>was argued, businesses increasingly wanted to do the right thing. However, challenges such 
</p>
<p>as complex supply chains, a lack of senior management buy-in and the cost implications of 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence processes mean that companies were not progressing as fast as 
</p>
<p>many would like them to. 
</p>
<p>54. One participant expressed the view that asymmetric power relations between the 
</p>
<p>State and transnational corporations presented the greatest challenge.  
</p>
<p>55. Attention was drawn to the vital role that trade unions could play in improving the 
</p>
<p>situation for workers and an example from Ghana was referred to. In 2008, trade unions 
</p>
<p>uncovered abusive conditions for workers in several camps of a Chinese company. The 
</p>
<p>trade unions stepped in and managed to improve the working conditions drastically to make 
</p>
<p>sure the workers got contracts, higher salaries and social security. Engagement with the 
</p>
<p>diplomatic mission had been important in succeeding in that case. 
</p>
<p>56. As an example of how civil society engaged with business to promote corporate 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights, the representative of the Business and Human Rights Resource 
</p>
<p>Centre drew attention to the organization&#8217;s approach of posting information from all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and confronting stakeholders with the allegations it received, asking for 
</p>
<p>comments.  
</p>
<p>57. Participants gave specific examples of company engagement with external parties 
</p>
<p>aimed at integrating the Guiding Principles into company operations, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) Nestl&#233;&#8217;s partnership with the Danish Institute for Human Rights to develop a 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence programme, including human rights impact assessments in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria and Angola; Nestl&#233;&#8217;s partnership with the Fair Labor Association on child labour 
</p>
<p>issues, and similar kinds of collaborations involving other companies, including with 
</p>
<p>International Alert in Uganda; 
</p>
<p>(b) A human rights impact assessment conducted and published by Kuoni in 
</p>
<p>Kenya (tourism sector).  
</p>
<p>58. The discussion covered lessons from other regions, and the experience of the 
</p>
<p>European Commission in promoting the Guiding Principles was shared with regional forum 
</p>
<p>participants. Attention was drawn to various guidelines that could prove useful in the 
</p>
<p>context of African business: 
</p>
<p>(a) Sector-specific guidance for implementing the Guiding Principles for the 
</p>
<p>following industries: the employment and recruitment industry; the information, 
</p>
<p>communication and technology sector; and the oil and gas sector; 
</p>
<p>(b) A booklet for SMEs called &#8220;My business and human rights&#8221; which provides 
</p>
<p>an introduction into the field in simple language. 
</p>
<p>59. Other initiatives by the European Commission to strengthen the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles were flagged as well, such as: encouraging States to develop 
</p>
<p>national action plans on business and human rights; and transparency requirements for large 
</p>
<p>companies from the European Union, which would require companies to report on non-
</p>
<p>financial issues and thereby enhance transparency on their human rights impacts and 
</p>
<p>measures taken to address them. 
</p>
<p>60. The discussion also covered issues such as the role of media as a tool to press 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders to implement the Guiding Principles, and the challenges of carrying 
</p>
<p>out human rights due diligence on the ground and building the awareness and capacity of 
</p>
<p>relevant staff within companies.  </p>

<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. An African strategy to advance the business and human rights agenda  
</b></p>
<p>61. The aim of the session was to reflect on options for developing an African strategy 
</p>
<p>on business and human rights through leadership at the regional level, including through 
</p>
<p>promoting development of national action plans.  
</p>
<p>62. During the discussion, participants highlighted the steps taken by African national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions to promote implementation of the Guiding Principles and that 
</p>
<p>business and human rights was a priority for the regional network of national institutions. 
</p>
<p>At the network&#8217;s 2011 conference in Yaound&#233;, three key areas had been identified: land 
</p>
<p>rights, water and work conditions. With regard to an African regional strategy on business 
</p>
<p>and human rights, the African network of national human rights institutions stressed the 
</p>
<p>following elements as important: 
</p>
<p>(a) The need to contextualize the Guiding Principles both at country and 
</p>
<p>continental level and identify innovative approaches by all actors; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Guiding Principles should be integrated in existing processes and 
</p>
<p>become a priority at the African Union level; 
</p>
<p>(c) The African Union should consider developing a legally binding instrument;  
</p>
<p>(d) The role of national human rights institutions should be recognized. 
</p>
<p>63. Civil society participants highlighted and challenged two assumptions that often 
</p>
<p>formed the basis of the business and human rights debate in Africa: first, the notion that 
</p>
<p>Africa had &#8220;weak States&#8221; was seen as problematic because States were not as weak as they 
</p>
<p>were often made out to be; second, the emphasis on the need for large-scale development 
</p>
<p>could be used as a pretext to ignore concerns raised by local communities. 
</p>
<p>64. It was argued there was a need to change the conversation, with emphasis on the 
</p>
<p>following points: 
</p>
<p>(a) Communities needed to have the right to choose their own path to 
</p>
<p>development; 
</p>
<p>(b) Customary law needed to be taken seriously; 
</p>
<p>(c) Community experience needed to be the starting point; 
</p>
<p>(d) Communities needed to be involved before a project was decided upon in 
</p>
<p>order to have the possibility of refusing consent. 
</p>
<p>65. Those four points were already enshrined in African instruments, such as the African 
</p>
<p>Charter and the resolution of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on a 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach to natural resource governance or the African Land Policy 
</p>
<p>Initiative.  
</p>
<p>66. A representative of UNECA highlighted the need to identify the common interests 
</p>
<p>of companies and States regarding human rights, pointing to the paradox of simultaneous 
</p>
<p>high economic growth rates and increasing poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The need for 
</p>
<p>inclusive development based on a human rights-based approach was stressed: two crucial 
</p>
<p>issues were access to education and health and the need for States to ensure adequate 
</p>
<p>regulation, including of private-sector service providers.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> VIII. Groups, contexts, sectors and national action plans 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Supporting and protecting human rights defenders and the role 
</b></p>
<p><b>of national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>67. The session aimed to identify challenges faced by human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>discuss how the Guiding Principles clarify the respective duties and responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>States and business and corresponding actions to address those challenges. A key issue was 
</p>
<p>the role that national human rights institutions could play.  
</p>
<p>68. It was highlighted that the human rights defenders working on issues related to 
</p>
<p>environmental protection, indigenous peoples, minority rights, people living in poverty and 
</p>
<p>construction projects frequently experienced serious attacks and harassment. 
</p>
<p>69. With regard to the role that national human rights institutions played in protecting 
</p>
<p>the human rights of human rights defenders, whether they were representatives of NGOs, 
</p>
<p>community-based organizations, trade unions or journalists, several mechanisms were 
</p>
<p>highlighted: possibilities for receiving complaints and carrying out investigations and 
</p>
<p>public hearings; public awareness campaigns; parliamentary submissions; reports to 
</p>
<p>regional and United Nations bodies; authoritative public statements/opinions; and influence 
</p>
<p>on relevant laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>70. Factors that enabled national institutions to play such roles included: the integrity of 
</p>
<p>commission members and appointment process; financial and operational independence; a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive legislative process, including an enforcement process; and the existence of 
</p>
<p>other effective institutions supporting the &#8220;embedding&#8221; of a human rights culture, e.g. an 
</p>
<p>independent judiciary and an effective parliament. 
</p>
<p>71. It was further stressed that, if national human rights institutions were to be credible, 
</p>
<p>they must have a clear mandate and acquire powers set out in law/from the national 
</p>
<p>constitution. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Business and human rights in conflict contexts 
</b></p>
<p>72. The session aimed to discuss challenges and good practices related to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles in conflict-affected areas and identify ways to 
</p>
<p>strengthen preventive measures and the implementation of the State duty to protect human 
</p>
<p>rights and ensure security.  
</p>
<p>73. Participants argued that the profit-seeking character and pragmatism of companies 
</p>
<p>had in some cases benefited communities and societies in conflict-affected areas. On the 
</p>
<p>other hand, that same pragmatism had led companies to focus on security measures with the 
</p>
<p>resulting risk of becoming complicit in human rights abuse, as demonstrated by emblematic 
</p>
<p>cases, such as the trade in conflict diamonds (Liberia, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe) and oil 
</p>
<p>extraction (Niger delta). 
</p>
<p>74. Guiding Principle 7 was recalled, which clarifies that the risk of human rights is 
</p>
<p>heightened in conflict-affected areas, and States should therefore intervene at the earliest 
</p>
<p>stage possible, provide support for companies in their due diligence, deny support to 
</p>
<p>companies involved in grave human rights abuses and make sure that regulations and 
</p>
<p>policies were appropriate to meet the specific risks of conflict-affected areas. Companies 
</p>
<p>should, as set out under the second and third pillars of the Guiding Principles, conduct due 
</p>
<p>diligence and, where a violation has taken place, ensure mediation and access to remedy. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>75. Concerning possible ways to strengthen the State duty to protect, it was suggested 
</p>
<p>there was a need for the home countries of transnational corporations to strengthen direct 
</p>
<p>regulation, given the often weak governance systems in conflict-affected areas. Several 
</p>
<p>participants expressed the view that, for grave human rights impacts, it should be possible 
</p>
<p>to hold corporate entitles liable under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>76. Attention was also drawn to the outcome of the 2013 International Conference in the 
</p>
<p>Great Lakes Region on natural resources in Bujumbura, which identified the following 
</p>
<p>main challenges: 
</p>
<p>(a) States frequently did not respect their own laws nor regional and international 
</p>
<p>standards; 
</p>
<p>(b) It was difficult to collect credible information on the situation on the ground; 
</p>
<p>(c) The negotiation and content of contracts between the Government and 
</p>
<p>companies were often highly politicized and lacked transparency; 
</p>
<p>(d) Extractive industries could have negative impacts on access to land, food 
</p>
<p>security and health; 
</p>
<p>(e) The most important challenge was often the lack of political will to address 
</p>
<p>those issues as well as lack of good governance and exclusion of civil society. 
</p>
<p>77. In order to address those challenges, three priorities were highlighted: strengthening 
</p>
<p>the inclusion of civil society; strengthening the rule of law; and raising awareness of 
</p>
<p>business and human rights issues among the population, including through media 
</p>
<p>campaigns.  
</p>
<p>78. Another focus of the discussion was the Montreux Document on pertinent 
</p>
<p>international legal obligations and good practices for States related to operations of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies during armed conflict and how it related to the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles. The former was adopted in 2008 and defines how international law applies to 
</p>
<p>the activities of private military and security companies when they are operating in an 
</p>
<p>armed conflict zone. It contains a set of good practices designed to help States take 
</p>
<p>measures nationally in order to fulfil their obligations under international law. As such, it is 
</p>
<p>a voluntary initiative and not legally binding. It was clarified that the initiative focused on 
</p>
<p>States because, although problems with private military and security companies had long 
</p>
<p>existed, there was a general lack of national oversight and no international regulation. To 
</p>
<p>date, 50 States had joined that initiative of the Government of Switzerland and the 
</p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross.  
</p>
<p>79. The discussion also underlined the fact that conflicts could occur in seemingly 
</p>
<p>peaceful environments. In that regard, South Africa was given as an example, where there 
</p>
<p>had been cases of conflict around extractive industry sites, including the Marikana incident 
</p>
<p>where 39 miners were killed in clashes with security forces. Participants argued that it was 
</p>
<p>crucial to unpack what &#8220;heightened due diligence&#8221; meant in those contexts, because a lot of 
</p>
<p>things could go wrong if due diligence was not carried out properly. 
</p>
<p>80. With regard to the issue of security and dealing with private and public security 
</p>
<p>forces, it was stressed that there were many existing guidelines, such as the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Principles on Security and Human Rights and the International Code of Conduct for Private 
</p>
<p>Security Service Providers, but that, in order to increase incentives for companies to adhere 
</p>
<p>to them, there was a need for better legislation.  
</p>
<p>81. International Alert&#8217;s guidance on conflict-sensitive business practice was 
</p>
<p>highlighted as an available tool for conducting impact assessments in conflict contexts. 
</p>
<p>Companies needed to assess their impacts from a rights-holder&#8217;s perspective; some 
</p>
<p>participants argued that standard social and environmental impact assessments to a large </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>extent took a company perspective and failed to engage with communities&#8217; concerns. 
</p>
<p>Human rights impact assessments were seen as much more promising in that regard.  
</p>
<p>82. It was further stressed that companies needed to act ethically and with integrity and, 
</p>
<p>if that was not possible, they should not invest. A key question to be asked of companies 
</p>
<p>investing in mines being built at the beginning of a project was whether the mine could be 
</p>
<p>built without a bullet being fired. If not, it was suggested that companies should probably 
</p>
<p>not invest in the first place. The need for a zero-harm policy not only for company staff but 
</p>
<p>also for the community was emphasized. Besides avoiding negative impacts, companies 
</p>
<p>should use their leverage and engage with stakeholders and communities to try to help 
</p>
<p>resolve existing or emerging conflicts in peaceful ways. 
</p>
<p>83. Further discussion addressed: different types of conflict scenarios in which 
</p>
<p>companies were operating and the need for meaningful community engagement and 
</p>
<p>empowering communities and civil society to be in a position to manage impacts; the 
</p>
<p>relationship between the Guiding Principles and the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights; the need for integrating gender analysis into any corporate activity in 
</p>
<p>conflict-affected areas; and how companies could contribute positively to improving State 
</p>
<p>conduct. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Investment in land: applying a human rights lens 
</b></p>
<p>84. The session aimed to identify challenges and opportunities in implementing the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles in land-related investments and business activities. The focus was on 
</p>
<p>agribusiness and large-scale land investments, including the implications of impacts on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>85. The discussion highlighted several key human rights issues, such as a lack of 
</p>
<p>consultation with local communities, loss of land and land acquisition without fair 
</p>
<p>compensation, forced resettlements, food insecurity and loss of livelihoods, and poor 
</p>
<p>working conditions for those employed in the sector. Case studies of corporate land 
</p>
<p>investments carried out by Oxfam were referred to, which found that, even if a company 
</p>
<p>had good policies and practice in relation to land rights, women were not commonly 
</p>
<p>involved in the consultation process and their land rights were not respected. The lack of 
</p>
<p>recognition of the rights of women and adverse impacts on their rights among investors was 
</p>
<p>found to be prevalent, and there was an urgent need to ensure empowerment and 
</p>
<p>meaningful engagement of affected women in that context. 
</p>
<p>86. The South African Human Rights Commission had also uncovered cases where 
</p>
<p>projects that were publicized as demonstrating good practice with regard to respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights showed a different reality, and that the affected poor community had not been 
</p>
<p>empowered to engage meaningfully. It was suggested that good practice would include 
</p>
<p>elements such as gender-sensitive budgets that supported promotion of gender equity.  
</p>
<p>87. A business representative stated that the Guiding Principles provided a good starting 
</p>
<p>point for companies to deal with business and human rights issues. In terms of practical 
</p>
<p>approaches, the need to build trust among different stakeholders and engender mutual 
</p>
<p>communication were emphasized and, at the same time, it was noted that such processes 
</p>
<p>took time and that companies faced a range of challenges (political history and context, 
</p>
<p>social expectations, environmental concerns, agronomical targets, economic costs and the 
</p>
<p>legal landscape) that had to be balanced. Free, prior and informed consent and participatory 
</p>
<p>approaches were seen as key elements for ensuring sustainable investments. 
</p>
<p>88. Human rights due diligence was also increasingly included in the portfolio of 
</p>
<p>corporate law firms, as it was increasingly seen as presenting opportunities for investors. 
</p>
<p>The experience by one major firm of advising clients investing in natural resources and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>land to increasingly bringing human rights into investment negotiations and &#8220;putting 
</p>
<p>humans into the corporate speak of due diligence&#8221; was shared. A number of elements to be 
</p>
<p>considered for moving towards better practices and contracts were highlighted, including 
</p>
<p>short durations, specifying the land and resources that were being allocated, flexibility to 
</p>
<p>re-negotiate contracts, making entitlements of investors subject to national law and 
</p>
<p>development priorities, avoiding &#8220;stabilization clauses&#8221; and ensuring transparency.  
</p>
<p>89. Finally, the guidance on State-investor contracts by the former Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
</p>
<p>corporations and other business enterprises was highlighted as a key reference.

</p>
<p><b> D. Strengthening implementation of the State duty to protect human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>through a national action plan 
</b></p>
<p>90. Another main objective of the forum was to promote development of national action 
</p>
<p>plans for implementing the Guiding Principles in Africa and identify essential elements of 
</p>
<p>such plans that would be of particular relevance in the local context. Thus, a key session of 
</p>
<p>the event was the panel focused on national action plans, which also served the purpose of 
</p>
<p>consultation with local stakeholders on the Working Group&#8217;s efforts to develop guidance to 
</p>
<p>support States in developing national action plans.10 
</p>
<p>91. A key message from the Working Group on Business and Human Rights throughout 
</p>
<p>the event was that national action plans were especially well-suited to advancing policy 
</p>
<p>coherence and implementation of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>92. The experience of the Government of Mozambique in developing a strategy for 
</p>
<p>implementing the Guiding Principles through a 2013 national initiative was shared at the 
</p>
<p>forum. The Government&#8217;s efforts would eventually result in a baseline study and drafting of 
</p>
<p>a national action plan. In that context, the need for broad consultations with all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and the Government&#8217;s need for financial and technical support, from 
</p>
<p>international donors as well as international and regional organizations, were emphasized. 
</p>
<p>93. Another example was given by a representative of the Moroccan National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission. It had launched a multi-stakeholder dialogue process and started work 
</p>
<p>to produce reports on specific issues, all which were going to feed into a national action 
</p>
<p>plan to be developed by the Government. Four points were emphasized: 
</p>
<p>(a) There was a need to sensitize Governments to the very specific problems 
</p>
<p>which must be tackled; 
</p>
<p>(b) There was a need to include all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>(c) While it was important to have guidance from the Working Group, business 
</p>
<p>and human rights challenges differed across countries, so national action plans would be 
</p>
<p>different from one country to another; 
</p>
<p>(d) National human rights institutions were very important in many regards: they 
</p>
<p>helped evaluate the situation, played a role in bringing stakeholders together and could 
</p>
<p>support capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>94. The session also featured the presentation of a toolkit developed by the International 
</p>
<p>Corporate Accountability Roundtable and the Danish Institute for Human Rights, intended 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>to guide States and other actors in developing national baseline studies and national action 
</p>
<p>plans. A number of specific issues relevant to national action plans in the African region 
</p>
<p>were raised: the role of international investment agreements; legislation pertaining to 
</p>
<p>environmental impact assessments; the impact of foreign direct investment; addressing 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability of State-linked businesses; and the sharing of knowledge 
</p>
<p>among different States.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>95. Further discussion addressed the position held by some that the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>and the development of national action plans, and the idea of a binding international treaty 
</p>
<p>on business and human rights were in opposition to each other. It was argued that this was a 
</p>
<p>mistake, and that independently of deliberations on a treaty, there should be focus on 
</p>
<p>developing plans that addressed the existing business and human rights challenges in 
</p>
<p>various countries. Three main issues were highlighted: 
</p>
<p>(a) Gender: there was a need to look at the impacts which were specific to 
</p>
<p>women; 
</p>
<p>(b) Conflict zones: business and human rights challenges were very particular in 
</p>
<p>such contexts; 
</p>
<p>(c) The need to tackle issues of extraterritoriality and access to remedy. 
</p>
<p>96. Other issues addressed during the discussions included the different challenges 
</p>
<p>facing developed and developing economies, as well as the need to look at the issue of tax 
</p>
<p>avoidance as a central business and human rights challenge. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Closing plenary: the way forward for the African business 
and human rights agenda 
</b></p>
<p>97. Speakers in the high-level closing plenary reiterated the importance of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles as an authoritative framework to prevent and address adverse human rights risks 
</p>
<p>and impacts of business activities, and emphasized the urgent need to scale up its 
</p>
<p>implementation across the continent.  
</p>
<p>98. The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Ethiopia stressed that economic growth 
</p>
<p>needed to be coupled with respect for human rights, and human dignity needed to be at the 
</p>
<p>centre of development. It was further stated that the Guiding Principles offered practical 
</p>
<p>and complex guidance to States and businesses to make that happen. The United Nations 
</p>
<p>system was a relevant partner for Governments in that effort but, importantly, African 
</p>
<p>strategies should be driven by African actors. 
</p>
<p>99. From a pan-African business viewpoint, human rights were just one of dozens of 
</p>
<p>considerations that companies must take into account every day. While the type of 
</p>
<p>involvement by companies depended on the challenges faced, the contexts in which they 
</p>
<p>operated and their core business, the responsibility to respect human rights was nevertheless 
</p>
<p>the same for all companies. One critical challenge was that the concept of human rights due 
</p>
<p>diligence had yet to enter the business arena in Africa, and there was a need for capacity-
</p>
<p>building. It was further emphasized that the Guiding Principles provided a useful 
</p>
<p>framework for addressing problems, and need to be contextualized at company level and 
</p>
<p>integrated into company strategies.  
</p>
<p>100. With regard to the role of civil society in advancing the business and human rights 
</p>
<p>agenda in Africa, a number of challenges were highlighted, although it was noted that not 
</p>
<p>all were relevant for all countries: disparity between growth in gross domestic product and 
</p>
<p>human development; a lack of an independent judiciary; operations by foreign providing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>revenues to oppressive authorities; corruption; and the need to strengthen rule of law. 
</p>
<p>Specific suggestions regarding the role of civil society included:  
</p>
<p>(a) The need to ensure that civil society was invited to and had the resources to 
</p>
<p>take part in international conferences such as the 2014 Africa Summit convened by the 
</p>
<p>Government of the United States of America; 
</p>
<p>(b) The need for African civil society organizations to work more closely with 
</p>
<p>home States of transnational corporations to clarify the actual problems on the ground; 
</p>
<p>(c) African civil society organizations should use the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p>including the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>and the treaty bodies to request action on business and human rights by their respective 
</p>
<p>Governments; 
</p>
<p>(d) Explore the development of an international tribunal to adjudicate some of 
</p>
<p>the gross human rights violations involving business enterprises; 
</p>
<p>(e) Address tax justice issues, as illicit financial flows were seen as an important 
</p>
<p>part of current problems. 
</p>
<p>101. In the closing remarks from the representative of the African Union Commission, 
</p>
<p>the commitment to engage with the Working Group to develop an African strategy to 
</p>
<p>implement the Guiding Principles was reiterated. Moreover, the potential of national action 
</p>
<p>plans to ensure constructive national dialogue and effective implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Principles, which ultimately should contribute to the well-being of individuals on the 
</p>
<p>continent, was emphasized. 
</p>
<p>102. The members of the Working Group noted that the forum had been an 
</p>
<p>unprecedented event, convening for the first time such a range of stakeholders from the 
</p>
<p>whole region to come together to discuss business and human rights issues. The forum had 
</p>
<p>also shown that increasing attention was being paid to the effects of economic growth and 
</p>
<p>investment on the environment and the human rights of workers and local communities. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group recalled in that regard that African States had played an active role in 
</p>
<p>the development of the United Nations Framework, and joined the global consensus 
</p>
<p>endorsing the Guiding Principles. It also underlined the crucial role of civil society and 
</p>
<p>affected stakeholders in demanding greater accountability, and recalled how many 
</p>
<p>participants had pointed to the potential of the Guiding Principles as a platform for breaking 
</p>
<p>political deadlock, and for transcending the adversarial roles that too often characterized 
</p>
<p>relationships between communities and companies.  
</p>
<p>103. In going forward, the Working Group highlighted the following issues as critical to 
</p>
<p>achieving progress: 
</p>
<p>(a) The importance of national action plans: they should be based on inclusive 
</p>
<p>consultation and result in focused actions to strengthen prevention and remedy of adverse 
</p>
<p>business-related human rights impacts; 
</p>
<p>(b) The need to enhance access to remedy, strengthen the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and build capacity to address business and human rights abuses;  
</p>
<p>(c) Ensure that economic growth did not come at the cost of human rights. 
</p>
<p>104. Among remaining challenges that needed further attention, the members of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group highlighted the lack of transparency surrounding State-investor contracts 
</p>
<p>and the activities of State-owned enterprises, as well as lack of oversight over booming 
</p>
<p>sectors in the region, such as agribusiness, telecommunications and retail.  
</p>
<p>105. Finally, the members of the Working Group stressed the need for solutions that took 
</p>
<p>into account those challenges, and acknowledged the realities of twenty-first century </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>globalization. In going forward, the Working Group concluded that the dialogue among the 
</p>
<p>key economic and political actors driving global corporate accountability, including the 
</p>
<p>African Union and stakeholders in the region, must continue. 
</p>
<p><b> X. </b>The Working Group&#8217;s reflections on the proceedings of the 
<b>regional forum: conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Working Group would like to express its appreciation to organizing 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners, supporters and all participants for their contributions to making the 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional forum a successful event. It was encouraged by the interest in and support 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the Guiding Principles expressed by the wide range of stakeholders who 
</b></p>
<p><b>participated, as these actors form a critical part of the movement that is needed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>scale up action on the Guiding Principles in all regions.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The discussions at the regional forum made a significant contribution in 
</b></p>
<p><b>informing the Working Group</b>&#8217;s<b> efforts to promote the effective implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles worldwide. Based on the inputs from participants, the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group would like to make the following observations and recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Regional Forum provided a unique opportunity for multi-
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholder dialogue and cooperation on business and human rights among relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>actors in Africa: multi-stakeholder engagement, involving all relevant groups, should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be a central element for further progress, both at regional and national levels, in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure effectiveness and legitimacy;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In order to take advantage of the momentum created by the regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>forum, strengthen the sharing of experiences and practices on implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles across countries in the region and continue to reinforce the links 
</b></p>
<p><b>between the global and regional business and human rights agendas (including to 
</b></p>
<p><b>inform the annual Forum on Business and Human Rights),</b>11<b> the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages stakeholders in Africa to convene local business and human rights forums 
</b></p>
<p><b>to share lessons and discuss solutions to aspects related to implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Effective implementation of the Guiding Principles requires ownership 
</b></p>
<p><b>by local stakeholders, and the Working Group commends the African Union 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission for its commitment to promoting concrete action plans, tailored to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realities of African countries, to implement the Guiding Principles.</b>12 <b>The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group would like to encourage the African Union Commission and relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms of the Afric</b>an Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, in particular 
</p>
<p><b>the Working Group on Extractive Industries, Environment and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violations, to support the development of such national action plans in alignment with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Guiding Principles and in collaboration with itself and OHCHR; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) All stakeholder groups at the regional forum stressed the importance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>national action plans on business and human rights. These were seen as a means to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen accountability and access to remedy and to ensure that human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>become an integral part of efforts to promote economic growth and development does 
</b></p>
<p><b>not come at the expense of those rights. The Working Group calls on all African States

<p><b>(f) The Working Group is concerned by reports of continued </b>&#8212;<b> and in

<p><b> I. Highlights from side events  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Key features and implications of the Guiding Principles on Business 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. A key objective of the regional forum was to offer an opportunity for capacity 
</p>
<p>building to participants. To this end, the first day included a training session on the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles, conducted by OHCHR.
a
 Participants were given an overview of the state of play 
</p>
<p>and the &#8220;what to do&#8221; in this field, notably the key elements of the three pillars of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles and the respective roles of States and business: 
</p>
<p>(i) The State duty to protect against human rights abuse resulting from business 
</p>
<p>activities through appropriate policies, regulation and adjudication; 
</p>
<p>(ii) The corporate responsibility to respect human rights by acting with due 
</p>
<p>diligence to avoid infringement on human rights and addressing adverse impacts that do 
</p>
<p>occur; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Enhancing access to effective remedy for victims of business-related human 
</p>
<p>rights abuse, through both judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>2. Participants learned about the main features of the Guiding Principles and that they 
</p>
<p>apply to all States and to all companies, of all sizes, in every sector, and in any country; 
</p>
<p>contain distinct, but complementary duties, responsibilities and roles of States and 
</p>
<p>companies; contain no new legal obligations, but elaborate on the practical implications of 
</p>
<p>existing international legal obligations of States and standards and practices for business; 
</p>
<p>clarify that human rights cannot be &#8220;offset&#8221;, meaning that philanthropic activities cannot 
</p>
<p>compensate for human rights harms elsewhere; and contain a &#8220;smart mix&#8221; of both 
</p>
<p>regulatory and voluntary approaches. 
</p>
<p>3. During the discussion a number of frequently asked questions were addressed: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>If the Guiding Principles themselves are not a legally binding document, how does 
</i></p>
<p><i>civil society monitor their implementation, and what are the implications of the 
</i></p>
<p><i>proposed treaty on business and human rights</i>: It was clarified that the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles are based on existing international human rights law, and that civil society 
</p>
<p>is encouraged to use the Guiding Principles as a benchmark in their monitoring of 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; performance, including to ask questions to States about what actions they are 
</p>
<p>taking to implement the Guiding Principles in processes such as the Universal 
</p>
<p>Periodic Review and human rights treaty body reporting. With regard to the 
</p>
<p>proposed treaty, it was noted that at this stage it is unclear what it will look like, but 
</p>
<p>that proponents of a treaty generally argued that such instrument would build upon 
</p>
<p>the framework set out in the Guiding Principles.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>How to deal with the conflict between international law and national law</i>: It was 
</p>
<p>clarified that the Guiding Principles do not tell companies to break the law in the 
</p>
<p>countries they are operating, but also recognize that sometimes national laws are in 
</p>
<p>conflict with international legal standards, in which case the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>prescribe that the responsibility of companies to respect human rights exists 
</p>
<p>independently of States&#8217; abilities and/or willingness to fulfil their own human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, and thus exists over and above compliance with national laws and 
</p>
<p>regulations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>What is the relationship between Guiding Principles and corporate social 
</i></p>
<p><i>responsibility (CSR)</i>: Participants heard that the Guiding Principles set out the 
</p>
<p>minimum standards for companies when it comes to human rights &#8212; that is, to 
</p>
<p>ensure that they do no harm and respect human rights wherever they operate &#8212; but 
</p>
<p>that there is nothing in the Guiding Principles that prevent them from pursuing CSR 
</p>
<p>activities that go beyond these minimum standards.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights and business tools 
</b></p>
<p>4. With the objective of providing regional forum participants with an overview of 
</p>
<p>some of the tools available to stakeholders in the area of business and human rights, a joint 
</p>
<p>session was hosted by the United Nations Global Compact and the Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Resource Centre.  
</p>
<p>5. The Global Compact Kenya Local Network gave a brief introduction on the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Global Compact, the UN Guiding Principles and the relationship between these 
</p>
<p>two mechanisms. Reference was made to various activities carried out by Local Global 
</p>
<p>Compact Networks to promote business and human rights, such as a &#8220;human rights and 
</p>
<p>business dilemmas&#8221; forum, trainings, sharing good practice notes and case studies, and 
</p>
<p>promotion of several special initiatives. The topics ranged from access to water, business in 
</p>
<p>conflict, child labour, decent jobs, gender equality, and human trafficking to product 
</p>
<p>misuse.  
</p>
<p>6. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre introduced how it works as an 
</p>
<p>information hub on different issues in relation to business and human rights. Its website 
</p>
<p>now includes the profiles of 5000 companies, featuring concerns raised by NGOs about 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses by companies and the responses from companies, positive initiatives 
</p>
<p>by companies, the work of United Nations Working Group as well as some regional 
</p>
<p>briefings on key business and human rights trends. The Resource Centre has representatives 
</p>
<p>and researchers in all regions, including several in Africa, covering the different sub-
</p>
<p>regions.  
</p>
<p>7. Discussion with the audience focused on the Resource Centre&#8217;s approach to publish 
</p>
<p>concerns about alleged human rights impacts of individual companies and to invite 
</p>
<p>implicated companies to respond after receiving the concerns raised by other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>It was noted that companies appreciate this approach, and that at the same time, the 
</p>
<p>Resource Centre also publishes the positive initiatives of companies.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights reporting in the African context 
</b></p>
<p>8. A session focused on human rights reporting was hosted by Shift. It was organized 
</p>
<p>as a consultation composed of two parts: the first part focusing on human rights reporting in 
</p>
<p>the African context, and the second part seeking views on the human rights reporting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>framework being developed by Shift through the Reporting and Assurance Frameworks 
</p>
<p>Initiative (&#8220;RAFI&#8221;).b  
</p>
<p>9. The introduction provided participants with an overview of current trends for human 
</p>
<p>rights reporting, highlighting that there is increasing demand for information from 
</p>
<p>companies on their human rights performance. Research conducted during the mandate of 
</p>
<p>former Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General on business and 
</p>
<p>human rights, John Ruggie, was highlighted, in which 20 law firms in 39 jurisdictions 
</p>
<p>(including Africa) looked at how corporate and securities laws were evolving to reflect 
</p>
<p>human rights.
c
 This research showed that the demand for sustainability reporting was on the 
</p>
<p>rise. More recent research by Shift had found a further increase in demands for corporate 
</p>
<p>reporting specifically on human rights from a wide range of stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>international organizations, national legislators, regulators, stock exchanges, and investors. 
</p>
<p>Many of these initiatives reference the Guiding Principles as a key framework for 
</p>
<p>reporting.
d
 
</p>
<p>10. Other panel presentations provided perspectives from both business and civil society 
</p>
<p>angles. From a business perspective, the initial focus was on the drivers for reporting on the 
</p>
<p>African continent, highlighting the increase in demand for information on how companies 
</p>
<p>are integrating the Guiding Principles. It was pointed out that producing this type of 
</p>
<p>information can in turn help companies improve their human rights performance and their 
</p>
<p>relationship with communities, while noting a number of specific challenges that remain, 
</p>
<p>including lack of knowledge and capacity on how to implement the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>Participants also heard from experiences of facilitating dialogue between companies and 
</p>
<p>communities on the ground in Malawi. This contribution highlighted the kind of 
</p>
<p>information that communities are seeking. Communities want information from companies 
</p>
<p>throughout the lifecycle of a project, from the inception, all the way to the winding up of a 
</p>
<p>project. It was underscored that companies&#8217; communication needs to be tailored to the 
</p>
<p>situation of communities and include concrete and practical information, such the human 
</p>
<p>rights assessment tools the company is applying, how it is complying with international 
</p>
<p>standards, audit procedures, and its human rights due diligence, and how its plans for 
</p>
<p>meaningful stakeholder engagement. Failure to deliver on such information may have real 
</p>
<p>impacts for a company, as highlighted by cases picked up by the media. Finally, it was 
</p>
<p>stressed that the Guiding Principles provide a good platform for engagement, seeking 
</p>
<p>redress and trust building among key stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>11. Further discussion with participants highlighted that regulatory frameworks across 
</p>
<p>the continent remain weak and that companies tend to evade their responsibility towards 
</p>
<p>communities and affected stakeholders. Civil society participants also expressed 
</p>
<p>dissatisfaction with the type of information that is currently provided by companies 
</p>
<p>operating in Africa on how they are addressing human rights risks. It was also highlighted 
</p>
<p>that drivers for reporting such as legislation and stock exchange requirements that are

<p>evolving in other regions, are less at play in Africa, and that currently it is rather civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations that are providing the strongest push behind demands for better 
</p>
<p>disclosure, but that most organizations lack capacity and resources. 
</p>
<p>12. Shift also presented the ongoing RAFI project, which is seeking to address the 
</p>
<p>increase in demands for corporate reporting on human rights performance and the risk of 
</p>
<p>highly divergent understandings of what this means in practice. The aim of the project is to 
</p>
<p>develop a twin set of frameworks grounded on the Guiding Principles: one with guidance 
</p>
<p>for companies on what good reporting on human rights looks like and the other with 
</p>
<p>guidance on what good assurance of such reports would involve. During the discussion 
</p>
<p>participants raised a number of issues that were relevant both for the African context and 
</p>
<p>beyond, including that reporting cannot replace dialogue with communities, the need to 
</p>
<p>take into account the role of the State, how to ensure accuracy of information provided by 
</p>
<p>companies, ensuring alignment with other initiatives, and ensuring that the data used for 
</p>
<p>reporting actually helps companies improve their human rights performance. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Building capacity for participatory monitoring and joint fact finding 
</b></p>
<p>13. The World Bank Group Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) and Global Rights 
</p>
<p>(Coordinator of the African Coalition for Corporate Accountability), with support from the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Global Compact, hosted a practically oriented session entitled &#8220;What to do 
</p>
<p>when project impacts are in dispute &#8211; Seeking solutions through participatory monitoring 
</p>
<p>and joint fact-finding with companies, communities, CSOs, and governments&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. The goal of the session was to examine the process through which NGOs can 
</p>
<p>collaborate with companies in monitoring corporate impacts based on guidance from CAO.
e
 
</p>
<p>Participants were given an introduction to the functions of CAO as an accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanism, set up to receive complaints directly from people affected by projects 
</p>
<p>sponsored by IFC or MIGA: through dispute resolution, assessing compliance with IFC 
</p>
<p>safeguards (which includes elements of the second pillar of the Guiding Principles), and 
</p>
<p>advising stakeholders. A specific focus of the session was on participatory water 
</p>
<p>monitoring, defined as &#8220;a participatory approach to monitor water. In the process, it not 
</p>
<p>only generates credible data and information but also builds trust and helps resolve or avoid 
</p>
<p>conflict surrounding perceived or actual impacts.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>15. Some of the challenges of participatory water monitoring highlighted at the session 
</p>
<p>included:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capacity of communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Turnover in companies and communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unclear legal liabilities, i.e. who is responsible for cleaning things up? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Role of governments which oftentimes side with companies. 
</p>
<p>16. The key process elements of participatory water monitoring included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Starting point: oftentimes, companies and NGOs do separate monitoring, which 
</p>
<p>leads to dispute over the results and lack in trust; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participatory monitoring describes process in which to do the different steps 
</p>
<p>together: collecting, analysing, interpreting, sharing results; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Idea is to include communities and local stakeholders, so participatory process is not 
</p>
<p>only scientific, but also social, political, and cultural;

<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Goals and outcome: more credibility of data generated, helps to create trust by 
</p>
<p>relevant local stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Can help prevent conflict, but also mitigate conflict; 
</p>
<p>17. Through discussions that sought to examine the perspectives of the common 
</p>
<p>stakeholder groups in water monitoring &#8212; communities, international NGOs, companies 
</p>
<p>and local Governments &#8212; the following challenges were identified:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Communication: when should what be communicated to whom? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identification of communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Finding ways/methodologies for the community to participate, e.g. how to ensure 
</p>
<p>representativeness, how to deal with the issue of illiteracy. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Community-based human rights impact assessment methodologies 
</b></p>
<p>18. Oxfam and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) hosted a 
</p>
<p>session focused on community-based human rights impact assessment methodologies, 
</p>
<p>introducing the tool &#8216;Getting it right&#8217;.f This tool is based on six phases: preparation; legal 
</p>
<p>framework; adapting the guide; investigation processes; analysis and report; engagement, 
</p>
<p>monitoring and follow-up. 
</p>
<p>19. The session addressed the difference notions of social Impact assessment (SIA), 
</p>
<p>human rights impact assessments (HRIA) and environmental impact assessments (EIA), 
</p>
<p>highlighting several dimensions: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The reference against which operations are analysed differs:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; SIA: broad range of social impacts; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; HRIA: impacts on human rights, anchored in international conventions; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; EIA: impacts on environment; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Perspective of how they have been applied: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; SIAs and EIAs are the traditional instruments taken by companies and have 
</p>
<p>mostly been implemented from a strong company-perspective; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; HRIA methodologies have a stronger focus on the perspective of rights 
</p>
<p>holders. 
</p>
<p>20. It was noted that there is a general view that with the gaining importance of human 
</p>
<p>rights due diligence, the SIAs will be replaced by HRIAs, and that one of the strong 
</p>
<p>advantages of HRIAs is a clearer understanding of who is responsible for what. However, 
</p>
<p>opinions continue to differ as to what extent HRIAs and EIAs should be integrated. 
</p>
<p>21. Discussion in the sessions was very rich, with company representatives, community 
</p>
<p>representatives, international NGOs, and academics engaging in very constructive debates 
</p>
<p>on how HRIAs should be carried out in practice.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Commerce, crime and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. The International Corporate Accountability Roundtable (ICAR) and Amnesty 
</p>
<p>International (AI) hosted a side event workshop with invited experts from the African 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>region to discuss prosecution opportunities as well as the challenges that currently exist and 
</p>
<p>how to overcome them. The event was convened with the support of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>23. The purpose of the event was to gather inputs to the ICAR/AI &#8220;Commerce, Crime, 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights Project&#8221;,g and the OHCHR programme of work aimed at enhancing 
</p>
<p>accountability and access to remedy, the aim of which is to develop reliable and credible 
</p>
<p>guidance for States as to how they can contribute to a fairer and more effective system of 
</p>
<p>domestic law remedies, particularly in cases of gross human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>24. This discussion identified perceived and actual obstacles that hinder prosecutions, as 
</p>
<p>well as existing laws that may allow for the prosecution of corporate crimes at the national 
</p>
<p>and international level. Participants shared recommendations on how to address obstacles,  
</p>
<p>25. Some of the obstacles identified included: 
</p>
<p>(i) The limitations of the structure and mandate of the relevant investigative and 
</p>
<p>prosecutorial offices; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Corruption among the judiciary; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Personal jurisdiction limitations; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Lack of access to evidence. 
</p>
<p>26. Recommendations put forward included: 
</p>
<p>(a) Establish and support specialized units that have a full mandate to investigate 
</p>
<p>and prosecute; 
</p>
<p>(b) Take lessons from the successes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices&#8217; Act, 
</p>
<p>leadership of the United States in particular on anti-corruption; 
</p>
<p>(c) Consider how these obstacles may be addressed through an international 
</p>
<p>agreement; 
</p>
<p>(d) Better collaboration between and among governments, particularly in cases 
</p>
<p>where multinational companies are involved; 
</p>
<p>(e) Reform the types of sanctions that are available so that corporate culture can 
</p>
<p>be addressed when necessary. 
</p>
<p>27. In general, the point was made that not enough cases have been tried in the African 
</p>
<p>region to have a perfect sense of what the key obstacles are, and that more work must be 
</p>
<p>done to ensure that these cases are investigated and tried.
