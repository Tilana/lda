humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all previous Human Rights Council resolutions on the Syrian Arab 
Republic, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> the grave deterioration of the human rights situation and the 
indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians as such, in violation of 
international humanitarian law, and acts of violence that may foment sectarian tensions, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deepest concern</i> about the findings of the independent international 
commission of inquiry and also the allegations contained in the evidence presented by 
&#8220;Caesar&#8221; in January 2014 regarding the torture and execution of persons incarcerated by the 
current Syrian regime, and underscoring the need for those allegations and similar evidence 
to be collected, examined and made available for future accountability efforts, 
</p>
<p><i>Strongly condemning</i> the lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities with the 
commission of inquiry, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing </i>its appreciation for the efforts of the Joint Special Representative of the 
United Nations and the League of Arab States, and expressing its deep regret at the failure 
to date to reach a political solution, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> Security Council resolution 2139 (2014) of 22 February 2014,  
expressing grave concern at its lack of implementation, and noting its demand for rapid, 
safe and unhindered humanitarian access and of the need to end impunity for violations of 
international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council that crimes 
against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been committed in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, and noting the repeated encouragement by the High Commissioner to the 
Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the efforts of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women and Syrian civil society to find a peaceful, inclusive and long-
term solution to the conflict, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the reports of the independent international commission on inquiry

civilians as a method of combat, and further condemns the besiegement of civilians;

human rights and all violations of international humanitarian law by the Syrian authorities 
and affiliated militias, including those involving aerial bombardment of civilian areas, in 
particular the indiscriminate use of barrel bombs, ballistic missiles, chlorine gas and cluster 
bombs, and other actions that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the use of chemical weapons and all indiscriminate 
methods of warfare in the Syrian Arab Republic, which is prohibited under international 
law, amounts to a serious crime and has a devastating impact on civilians, and in this regard 
calls upon the Syrian authorities to accelerate the complete and irreversible elimination of 
their chemical weapons programme and the removal of its chemical weapons in accordance 
with their obligations under the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and the 
time frames pursuant to Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) of 27 September 2013,

</p>
<p>15. <i>Demands</i> that the Syrian authorities meet their responsibility to protect the 
Syrian population; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Notes</i> the reporting of the commission of inquiry, including on the amount 
and type of crimes committed, in which it assesses that crimes against humanity and war 
crimes have been, and continue to be, committed in the territory of the Syrian Arab 
Republic; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Also notes</i> that the International Criminal Court was established to help end 
impunity for such crimes where the State is unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out 
investigations or prosecutions; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Emphasizes </i>the need to ensure that all those responsible for violations of 
international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights law are held to 
account, through appropriate fair and independent domestic or international criminal justice 
mechanisms, and stresses the need to pursue practical steps towards this goal, noting the 
important role that the International Criminal Court can play in this regard; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Reaffirms</i> that, in the context of an inclusive and credible dialogue, the Syrian 
people should determine the appropriate process and mechanisms to achieve justice, 
reconciliation, truth and accountability for gross violations and abuses of international law, 
as well as reparations and effective remedies for victims; 
</p>

to the Syrian crisis have not so far succeeded and condemns those parties who have 
undermined such efforts;  
</p>
<p>24. <i>Reaffirms</i> its commitment to international efforts to find a political solution 
to the Syrian crisis that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for a civil, 
democratic and pluralistic State, where all citizens are equal, regardless of gender, religion 
and ethnicity, and emphasizes that the decision to hold presidential elections on 3 June 
2014, in the midst of this crisis, undermined the Geneva communiqu&#233;, which calls for a 
transitional governing body with full executive powers to be agreed by mutual consent, in 
order to achieve a peaceful settlement;  
</p>
<p>25. <i>Urges</i> those countries with influence over the Syrian parties to take all 
measures to encourage the parties to the conflict to negotiate constructively and on the basis 
of the call made in the Geneva communiqu&#233; for the formation of a transitional governing 
body; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to support the leadership and full 
participation of women in political talks as envisaged by the Security Council in its 
resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and 2122 (2013) of 18 October 2013, and 
welcomes the work of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women, and its partners, in this regard; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Condemns</i> the intentional denial of humanitarian assistance to civilians, from 
whatever quarter, and in particular the denial of medical assistance and the withdrawal of 
water and sanitation services to civilian areas, which has recently worsened, noting 
especially the primary responsibility of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic in this 
regard, and deplores the deteriorating humanitarian situation; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Further strongly condemns</i> all acts of violence directed against humanitarian 
actors, and demands that the Syrian authorities promptly allow, and all other parties to the 
conflict do not obstruct, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for United Nations 
humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners, including across conflict lines and 
across borders, in order to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches people in need 
through the most direct routes; 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the growing number of refugees and internally 
displaced persons fleeing the violence, and welcomes the efforts by neighbouring countries 
to host Syrian refugees while acknowledging the socioeconomic consequences of the 
presence of large-scale refugee populations in those countries; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Urges</i> the international community, including all donors, to provide urgent 
financial support to enable the host countries to respond to the growing humanitarian needs 
of Syrian refugees, while emphasizing the principle of burden-sharing; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Calls upon</i> all members of the international community to respond 
expeditiously to the Syrian humanitarian appeal and fulfil previous pledges; 
</p>
<p>32. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
