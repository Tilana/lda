 OVERVIEW
Metals for modern societies 
The world’s metal requirements are growing as large, population-dense 
developing countries achieve the economic preconditions necessary for urban-
isation and modernisation. A more modern society leads to increased con-
sumption of capital goods, and investments in more advanced housing, and 
augments the need for infrastructural expansion. Boliden’s main metals – zinc 
and copper – are primarily used in the construction and automotive industries, 
with the emphasis on infrastructure. Consumption of these metals has almost 
doubled over the past 25 years and the growth in consumption will continue as 
living standards improve worldwide. Boliden has produced base and precious 
metals through exploration, mining and smelting operations, and recycling for 
a good many years now. Continuous development of technology and produc-
tion methods has enabled our mines and smelters to maintain high standards, 
from an international viewpoint, with regard to the environment, staff  safety, 
and productivity.

Boliden is the world’s 
fi fth biggest producer 
of zinc metal from 
smelters and the 
eighth biggest pro-
ducer of metal con-
centrate from mines. 
Zinc is an easily 
worked base metal 
with good alloyability 
and when used in gal-
vanisation, provides 
steel with a high 
degree of corrosion 
resistance. Approxi-
mately half of all zinc 
produced is used in 
galvanisation. Boli-
den’s zinc is mainly 
sold to the European 
steel industry and the 
end-users come 
mainly from the con-
struction and auto-
motive industries.
Boliden is a medium-
sized producer of 
 copper metal from 
smelters and a smaller 
producer of metal in 
the form of mined 
concentrate. Boliden 
is Europe’s third big-
gest producer of both 
metal and metal con-
centrate. Copper is a 
good conductor of 
both electricity and 
heat. Boliden’s copper 
is mainly sold to 
European manufac-
turers of copper com-
ponents, such as wire 
rod, and semi- fi nished 
goods, who, in turn, 
supply end-users in 
the construction, 
 electronics and auto-
motive industries.
Boliden produces 
lead in the form of 
both primary lead 
from mines and 
 secondary lead from 
recycled batteries. 
Boliden has a strong 
position in Europe. 
Th  e majority of the 
world’s lead produc-
tion is used in the 
manufacture of 
vehicular batteries 
and other industrial 
applications. Approx-
imately 75 per cent 
of Boliden’s lead pro-
duction comes from 
recycled batteries and 
most of its lead is sold 
to the battery indus-
try, with a smaller 
percentage sold to 
the construction 
industry.
Gold is an important 
metal in Boliden’s 
mines and smelters. 
Boliden’s gold pro-
duction totals around 
15,000 kilos per 
annum, two thirds of 
which comes from 
the smelters’ elec-
tronic recycling proc-
esses, with the 
remainder coming 
from copper concen-
trate. Th  e biggest 
sphere of use for the 
metal is in jewellery, 
but it is increasingly 
also regarded as an 
asset class for fi nan-
cial players. Th  e 
world’s central banks 
have massive gold 
reserves.
Several of Boliden’s 
mines have substantial 
amounts of silver and 
the Group produces 
approximately 500,000 
kilos of silver per 
annum. Silver is a very 
good conductor of heat 
and electricity. Th  e 
electrical and electron-
ics industries currently 
consume just over half 
of global silver produc-
tion, while usage in the 
photographic industry 
is declining. As with 
gold, silver is increas-
ingly being regarded as 
an asset class for fi nan-
cial players.

DRAMATIC FLUCTUATIONS IN 2009
Targeted measures and a strong recovery 
in metal prices have enabled Boliden to emerge 
robust from a difficult period. Challenging 
times  notwithstanding,  we  resolved  to  go 
ahead with the expansion of the Aitik mine 
and as a result, the production increase can 
begin at the start of the second quarter of 
2010.
A YEAR INITIALLY MARKED BY GLOBAL 
RECESSION 
To understand the market conditions and the 
challenges Boliden faced in 2009, we must 
think back to what happened previously. The 
price of zinc began to fall back in 2007, while 
the price of copper had remained at historically 
high levels all the way up until the fourth quar-
ter, when it fell by 50 per cent in just a few 
weeks.
Large disbursements were going to be made 
in conjunction with the expansion of the Aitik 
mine, where we are investing a total of Sek 6 
billion, with the majority of the money being 
spent in 2008 and 2009. With such major 
financial undertakings and with indications 
that the economic climate was about to worsen, 
we refinanced our loan portfolio in the spring 
of 2008 and extended our copper and dollar 
hedging contracts at favourable levels.
Our planning for 2009 included the assess-
ment that prices would not fall below the lev-
els seen at the end of 2008/beginning of 2009, 
when prices, relative to the industry’s produc-
tion costs, were at levels similar to those seen 
when prices bottomed out in the early 1980s

and 90s. We calculated that Boliden would be 
able to retain sufficient financial strength if sav-
ings  programmes  were  implemented  and 
investments restricted.
A BALANCE BETWEEN SHORT-TERM 
MEASURES AND LONG-TERM INVEST-
MENTS
Maintaining a healthy balance between short-
term measures and long-term investments is 
important in a business where many decisions 
take a long time to implement. We opted, 
instead, to cut costs through implementing 
staff reductions, by increasing our purchasing 
efficiency, and by cutting back on our explora-
tion investments. Maintenance work was also 
minimised and postponed. At the same time, 
we decided to continue with the Aitik expan-
sion and the extension of a new tailings pond 
in the Boliden Area. Measures designed to 
improve profitability at the Tara mine were also 
intensified, and we continued with the change 
management programme already begun, with 
the aim of establishing a culture of continuous 
improvement in accordance with what is com-
monly known as lean methodology – what we, 
here at Boliden, call the New Boliden Way.
Production of zinc and copper at our smelt-
ers was reduced in order to adjust production 
levels in line with market conditions. Our 
mines have enjoyed a more favourable climate, 
with a better market balance, and have been 
able to produce at full capacity throughout.
Our cost cutting has been implemented as 
planned. Investments stayed within the reduced

frameworks and metal prices stayed above the 
level obtaining at the end of 2008/beginning of 
2009. An improved market climate enabled the 
zinc smelters to return to full production dur-
ing the latter half of 2009, but the copper smelt-
ers remained at low levels of capacity utilisation 
throughout the year.
RAPID RECOVERY DRIVEN BY CHINA
The weakening of the Swedish krona during the 
period when metal prices were at their lowest 
was  positive  for  us.  The  decline  in  global 
demand was also shorter in duration than we 
had anticipated – a trend due, entirely, to the 
strong development in China.
Demand for copper and zinc is largely reli-
ant on urbanisation and increasing prosperity 
in population-dense parts of the world. The 
past ten years have seen large numbers of  people 
moving from rural areas into towns and cities 
– a trend that has been particularly strong in 
China. After the collapse of the financial  system 
in October 2008, demand fell rapidly in most 
countries,  but  China,  which  had  already 
emerged as the world’s biggest market for cop-
per and zinc, put in place governmental stim-
ulus packages that resulted in strong economic 
growth. Signs of a slow economic recovery in 
North  America  and  Europe  also  became 
increasingly clear in the latter half of 2009, and 
expectations of continued strong demand in 
China and economic recovery in the mature 
economies resulted in a rise in the prices of zinc 
and copper.
In response to the rise in metal prices, the 
world’s mines are now producing at almost full 
capacity, but many smelters are operating at 
reduced production levels because the global 
smelter capacity is substantially larger than the 
mines’ capacity for metal concentrate produc-
tion. Competition between the smelters for 
mined concentrate, which is in short supply, is 
severe and this situation is expected to continue 
for many years to come.
NEW MINING CAPACITY BECOMES 
 OPERATIONAL
Substantial resources have been invested over 
the past year in the expansion of Aitik, which is 
one of the biggest industrial projects currently 
in progress in Sweden. All of the infrastructure 
and the first of two sections of the new concen-
trator will come on line on 1st April this year. 
Three months later, on 1st July, section two will 
come on line. The increased capacity will not 
only result in higher productivity at Aitik; it will 
improve the Rönnskär copper smelter’s raw 
materials supply. Production will start at the
THIS IS BOLIDEN / PRESIDENT’S STATEMENT
Maurliden open pit mine in the Boliden Area 
at the end of 2010, when the new tailings pond 
is completed.
MARKET PREDICTIONS DIFFICULT
Predicting the metal markets is difficult and 
prices vary substantially from one period to 
another. The last two years have seen very dra-
matic trends, with rapid falls and equally rapid 
rises. We believe that it is possible to predict 
price lows reasonably accurately, but that pre-
dicting price peaks is very difficult. Base metal 
prices have risen in 2009 at the same time as 
official metal stocks have grown – increasing 
the price risk in the market. Most experts are 
agreed that demand from China, coupled with 
an economic recovery in Europe and the Usa, 
will result in shortages of copper and zinc over 
the next few years. If this scenario is realised, 
metal prices will remain at high levels. If not, 
they will be corrected downwards.
It will be the mines, rather than the smelt-
ers, that act as limiters on global metal produc-
tion in the next few years. The smelters’ excess 
capacity will make life hard for units requiring 
major investments in enhancing poor environ-
mental performance for instance, and some 
may go to the wall. This may, in the long term, 
lead to reduced global smelter capacity and bet-
ter terms for the remaining smelters.
PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE – 
 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
We have continued to work with our organisa-
tional and operational philosophy – the New 
Boliden Way – with the aim of improving pro-
ductivity and process stability throughout our 
operations. Training programmes have been 
implemented for our 140 most senior manag-
ers during the year. Pilot projects designed to 
identify new areas with scope for improvement 
have been launched at Kokkola, Rönnskär, 
Harjavalta and Kristineberg in the Boliden 
Area,  and  2010  will  see  the  programme 
expanded to more units. Achieving short-term 
productivity improvements is not at the top of 
Boliden’s agenda: it is far more important that 
we, with the aid of significant investments in 
management development, establish a culture 
of continuous improvement that permeates the 
entire Group.
One of the biggest challenges faced by the 
metals industry is to meet the world’s metal 
requirements  with  the  minimum  possible 
impact on people and the environment. We 
have been working hard on environmental, 
health and safety issues for a number of years 
now, and have achieved good results. Contin-
uing our efforts to promote sustainable devel-
opment at every stage of the value chain is fun-
damental to Boliden’s development and an 
increasingly important issue across our entire 
industry.
One of the challenges we face in the slightly 
longer term is that of energy and climate change 
issues. When the Eu’s new legislation relating 
to the emissions rights trading system comes 
into force in 2013, all smelters and mines will be 
covered. This will result in higher costs for indi-
rect carbon dioxide emissions, particularly due 
to the smelters’ energy requirements. Boliden 
is, in partnership with other electricity-inten-
sive  companies,  involved  in  nuclear  power 
projects in Sweden and Finland, with the aim 
of securing long-term, reliable access to energy 
at competitive prices.
The long-term trend in demand is upwards, 
but the economic climate will continue to fluc-
tuate in the years ahead. It is by looking to the 
future and planning ahead that we will be able 
to generate the prerequisites we need to exploit 
value-creating commercial opportunities, even 
in a downturn.
Boliden also has several interesting opportu-
nities for expansion, and we are monitoring the 
potential for acquisition-based growth along-
side a number of other projects within the 
framework of our existing operations.
In conclusion, I can state that we have coped 
well with the challenging year that was 2009. 
The trend in metal prices is, of course, one 
important reason for our success, but Boliden’s 
loyal employees have all helped implement the 
measures and activities needed to ameliorate 
the downturn, and I would, therefore, like to 
say a big thank you to every single Boliden 
employee for their efforts over the past year.

THIS IS BOLIDEN / THE OUTSIDE WORLD / DEMAND
BASE METALS DEMAND 
– GLOBAL DEMAND INCREASING
Demand for zinc and copper – Boliden’s main metals – is driven pri-
marily by demand from the construction and automotive industries, with 
the emphasis on infrastructure. Global zinc and copper consumption has 
increased by 43 and 35 per cent, respectively, over the last ten years.
Th  e growth in demand for base metals has primarily been driven, since 
the start of the new millennium, by increased economic prosperity in 
China and other population-dense countries. Metal consumption in 
developing countries with rapid economic growth has increased dramat-
ically as a percentage of global consumption, and economic development 
in these countries is, nowadays, of critical importance in terms of the 
future trend in demand for base metals.
Increased economic prosperity in developing countries generates the 
preconditions for investing in more advanced housing and capital goods, 
such as cars and household appliencies. It also increases the need for infra-
structural expansion. Over the last few decades, China has developed 
from a country with low levels of per capita metal consumption into an 
industrial nation. With a large and growing domestic manufacturing base 
for motor vehicles and other capital goods, coupled with substantial 
investments in infrastructure, demand for base metals is increasing. Chi-
na’s zinc and copper consumption in 2009 was, for the fi rst time ever, 
greater than the combined consumption of North America and Europe. 
Per capita consumption is, however, still lower than in most of the mature 
economies. Other population-dense countries can, in future, be expected 
to mirror China’s development in this respect.
Per capita metal consumption in mature economies is usually high, 
but growth is stagnating due to low rates of population growth, a slower 
rate of infrastructural expansion, and generally lower investment require-
ments in the construction sector. Metal consumption in future is expected 
to continue high in these countries, but with low growth rates. Th  e serv-
ice sector is of greater importance to economic growth in mature econ-
omies than the sectors that consume base metals.
Base metals are globally priced raw materials. Demand for zinc and 
copper is driven by global activity levels in the construction and automo-
tive industries and the pricing of base metals is determined by the bal-
ance between supply and demand, which is refl ected in the daily trading 
on the world’s offi  cial metal exchanges. Smelters’ pricing terms are, to
some extent, aff ected by the regional balance between metal consump-
tion and smelter capacity, which determines metal premium levels. Treat-
ment and refi ning charges, which make up the largest component of 
smelters’ income, are determined by the balance between the smelters’ 
production capacity and the availability of metal concentrate from the 
mines and of recycling materials. Th  e cost of zinc and copper as a per-
centage of the total cost of end products, such as cars and buildings, is 
low. Changes in base metal prices consequently have a limited eff ect in 
the short term on industrial demand for base metals.

BASE METALS SUPPLY 
– MINE CAPACITY A LIMITING FACTOR
THIS IS BOLIDEN / THE OUTSIDE WORLD / SUPPLY
The supply of zinc and copper metal is essentially determined by 
the mining industry’s production capacity. Lead times from discov-
ery of a new deposit to mining production are often long and supply 
is, therefore, considerably less elastic than the cyclically sensitive 
short to medium term demand.
A number of mines worldwide close every year because they have reached 
the end of their production life. Most years also see the opening of a 
number of new mines. The lead time from planning a mine to produc-
tion can be a long one, because infrastructure must be established at the 
mine. The infrastructure must, among other things, secure a reliable sup-
ply of energy and water and establish efficient logistics, both within the 
mining area and to the customers – the smelters. The mining operations’ 
environmental impact must also be minimised and obtaining the neces-
sary licences for mining operations is a time-consuming process. Pre-
dicted metal price levels during a mine’s lifespan and the risks entailed, 
given that mining projects are capital intensive, are of critical importance 
in determining whether a mining project is completed and results in a 
producing mine. Pilot studies, analyses, planning and the construction 
of a mine can stretch over periods of both boom and bust, and hence 
sound financial planning and stamina are a must.
If new mine projects are delayed or if demand rises rapidly, the supply 
of metals may be limited for a while, even when metal price levels are very 
high. Falling metal prices and the reduced availability of capital for much 
of 2008 and 2009 resulted in the postponement of investments in new 
mine deposits. At the same time, metal grades are falling in many of the 
world’s mines, which is usual when mines approach the end of their 
lifespans. Zinc and copper mine capacity may, for these reasons, decline 
for a while until new mine projects come into production.
There are measured mineral deposits in the world that contain signifi-
cant amounts of metal but which often require substantial investments 
in advanced technology and infrastructure before they can become pro-
ductive. The deposits are generally less accessible and the ore has a higher 
level of impurities than those mines currently in production. Many of 
these deposits are located in regions where the political risk is high, which 
would probably result in high yield requirements to compensate for the 
higher level of risk being taken. Completing these projects and turning
Boliden’s zinc metal is of so-called Special High Grade (SHG) quality and  
is increasingly supplied in the form of alloys developed in partnership with 
 customers.
the deposits into new, producing mines will probably require a belief that 
metal prices will be high in future.
The smelting industry is currently experiencing excess capacity for zinc 
and copper because the expansion of capacity in developing countries – 
and in China, in particular – has continued in 2008 and 2009. Energy 
consumption levels are high at some of the world’s smelters, while envi-
ronmental performance levels are low. High energy prices, tighter regu-
lation in the environmental sphere, and a consolidation of the industry 
into larger production units may result in production capacity where 
energy consumption is high and the environmental impact is substan-
tial being forced to close. This trend notwithstanding, smelter capacity 
is expected to outstrip mines’ concentrate production for the foreseeable 
future, which may, in turn, result in smelters’ prices and terms coming 
under pressure.
GLOBAL zINC AND COPPER  
MINING PRODUCTION
Global mining capacity is expected to fall in a few years 
as a result of lower metal grades, mine closures, and 
recent years’ lower levels of investment in new deposits.
GLOBAL zINC AND COPPER  
METALS PRODUCTION
Expanded smelter capacity in China and other devel-
oping countries in recent years has resulted in global 
overcapacity for both zinc and copper production.
zINC GRADES FALLING  
IN MINES WORLDWIDE
Metal grades are expected to fall at many of the 
world’s zinc and copper mines, as is usual when 
mines approach the end of their lifespan.

BOLIDEN’S BUSINESS MODEL
EXPLORATION
Successful exploration is vital to long-term mining opera-
tions and metal production. The primary focus of Boliden’s 
exploration is on zinc-, copper- and precious metal-bearing 
ores. The exploration work is conducted in the vicinity of 
existing mines, in order to increase their lifespan, and in 
new areas in order to expand our mine portfolio with new 
deposits.
MINES
Zinc-, copper-, lead-, gold- and silver-bearing 
ores are mined in Boliden’s four mining 
areas. The ore is transported to concentra-
tors in the various areas, where the ore is 
crushed and processed to produce zinc and 
 copper concentrate that also contains lead 
and precious metals. Approximately 60% of 
the zinc concentrates and virtually all of the 
copper concentrate is refi ned in Boliden’s 
smelters.

EXPLORATION FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH
If long-term growth is to be secured, new mineral deposits must be 
added to the portfolio at a rate that outstrips mine production. 
 Boliden has extensive experience of large-scale exploration using 
advanced techniques. Our methods are constantly improving and 
Boliden is now able to locate deposits more than 1 kilometre below 
the surface of the ground. Th  e exploration work is conducted in four 
overall phases: area selection, initial regional surveys, further local 
surveys of particularly interesting areas, and test drilling. Th  e latter 
two phases are the most time-intensive. Th  e results of the test drill-
ing work, coupled with Boliden’s technical expertise, form the basis 
for decisions on whether the economic preconditions for expanding 
an existing mining area or commencing new mining operations.

MINES WITH HIGH PRODUCTIVITY
Boliden has extensive experience of developing mines with what are, 
by international standards, low metal grades. As a result, our min-
ing areas nowadays have generally high and competitive productiv-
ity levels in terms both of mining and of concentration.
Further developing our expertise in the fi elds of mine design, 
extraction methods and concentration processes will be an impor-
tant factor in our success, forming the basis for continued good com-
petitiveness and our ability to conduct operations in a cost-eff ective 
way and generate the preconditions for growth.
Th  e market for metal concentrate – the mines’ product – is a 
 global one and income is based on the metal prices set daily on the 
London Metal Exchange (Lme).

SMELTERS
Boliden’s fi ve smelters refi ne various 
kinds of raw material – from mined 
 concentrate to electronic scrap – to 
produce both standardised and custo-
mised base metals. The production of 
Boliden’s own mines covers 70% of the 
zinc smelters’ capacity but the ability to 
optimise quality and pricing terms 
means that approximately 60% of the 
zinc concentrate is bought in externally. 
The mines’ copper production covers 
approximately 20% of the copper 
 smelters’ production capacity.
CUSTOMERS
Boliden’s metals are mainly sold to 
industrial customers in Europe, but are 
also sold to metal dealers. A large part 
of our zinc is sold to major steel com-
panies, while the copper is sold to 
manufacturers of wire rod, copper 
rods and copper alloys. Boliden also 
sells lead, gold and silver, and products 
such as sulphuric acid and aluminium 
fl uoride.

SMELTERS WITH A BROAD INCOME BASE
Boliden’s smelters use in-house developed smelting techniques and 
fl exible smelting processes. Th  is enables us to process several diff er-
ent types of raw material of varying purity levels in an environmen-
tally friendly way. Our technology also enables us to exploit other 
products contained in the raw materials, such as precious metals. 
Treatment and refi ning charges (Tc/Rc) are the income the smelt-
ers receive from suppliers for refi ning the metal concentrate and sec-
ondary materials, such as electronic scrap, to produce fi nished met-
als. Externally purchased metal concentrate with higher impurity 
levels can be refi ned with higher Tc/Rc, and have a positive impact 
on profi tability. Th  e smelters also, and in addition to the Lme price, 
receive premiums negotiated individually with customers.
BREAKDOWN 
OF  SMELTERS’ 
GROSS  PROFIT
Free metals, metal premiums and by-
products are important factors in the 
smelters’ profi ts, over and above treat-
ment and refi ning charges.

FACTORS THAT AFFECT 
BUSINESS AREA 
 SMELTERS’ RESULTS
•		Treatment	and	refi	ning	
charges (Tc/Rc).
•		Lme price and exchange rate 
(primarily Usd) trends, which 
aff ect the value of free metals 
and the Tc agreements’ price-
sharing mechanism (for zinc 
smelters). 
•		A	customer	mix	that	generates	
higher metal premiums.
•		Stability	in	the	production	
process and low costs. 
•		Th	 e	ability	to	extract	a	high	
percentage of the raw materi-
al’s metal content. 
•		Energy	prices	and	energy	effi		-
ciency, because smelter opera-
tions are energy-intensive – 
particularly for zinc.
See page 100 for an explanation of industry 
 concepts and terminology.
LONG-TERM CUSTOMER AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Base metals are essentially standardised and interchangeable prod-
ucts that are priced on a global market. Transport costs mean that 
the market for fi nished base metals is, however, essentially regional. 
Boliden focuses on establishing long-term relationships, primarily 
with industrial customers located close to the smelters and other 
metal dealers. Th  ese sales generate a metal premium, which is not 
the case for deliveries to Lme stocks.
But while base metals are very much standard products, scope 
does exist for a degree of diff erentiation. Th  is is particularly true with 
regard to zinc, where our smelters work closely with customers with 
specialist requirements, and Boliden has, in partnership with its cus-
tomers, developed a number of zinc alloys that improve the metal’s 
properties in a variety of ways.
FACTORS THAT 
 GENERATE ADDED 
VALUE FOR INDUSTRIAL 
CUSTOMERS
•		Product	customisation	
that enhances the effi  -
ciency of the customers’ 
processes.
•		Product	customisation	
that improves the refi ned 
products’ properties and 
cuts costs.
•		Effi		cient	logistics	solu-
tions that reduce the 
amount of customer 
 capital tied up. 
•		Responsibility	for	people	
and the environment that 
builds a sustainable start 
to the metals’ long value 
chain.

THIS IS BOLIDEN / STRATEGIC FOCUS
PROFITABLE GROWTH
Boliden has built up a competitive position in the fields of explo-
ration, mining operations, concentration, smelter operations and 
recycling over the years. Boliden’s main strengths are mine design and 
productivity, coupled with process efficiency, flexibility and environ-
mental performance by the smelters. Every aspect of the operations 
works towards the continuous development of its strategic strengths, 
in order to achieve growth and profitability.
EFFICIENCY AND STABILITY
Boliden’s competitiveness and profitability are based on the ability of the 
two Business Areas, Mines and Smelters, to optimise their operations on 
the basis of their respective strengths and preconditions while, at the same 
time, exploiting the synergies between the business areas. These syner-
gies include, for example, the ability to optimise smelter processes by 
using internally mined concentrate. Efficient processing of the major 
flows, both physical and financial, that run between Boliden’s own mines 
and smelters and to and from external suppliers and customers, enables 
us to limit the amount of capital tied up. This, in turn, has positive effects 
on the Group’s cash flow.
The metals market is volatile and the balance between supply and 
demand of both metal concentrate and finished metals changes over time. 
The fact that Boliden’s operations extend from exploration and mining 
operations to the production and sale of metals helps, to some extent, to 
stabilise profitability and cash flows over the business cycle.
LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH
The long-term availability of raw materials, namely metal concentrates 
and different types of recycling materials, is a prerequisite of continued 
growth. Boliden’s growth-related focus is, therefore, on developing both 
existing mines and new mining areas and on evaluating the acquisition 
of mines.
We can also potentially increase the smelters’ capacity for recycling 
electronic scrap, metal ashes and other secondary materials. At the 
Rönnskär copper smelter, electronic scrap and other recycling materials 
account for just over 20 per cent of the raw material consumed. Over and 
above the societal and environmental benefits this approach yields, it also, 
to some extent, reduces Boliden’s reliance on supplies of, in particular, 
copper concentrate.
BOLIDEN’S VISION
Boliden’s vision is to be a world-class metals partner. Not only do we 
endeavour to live up to or exceed our customers’ expectations, we also 
endeavour to be a globally respected company. Boliden shall be one of 
the industry’s leaders when it comes to generating a good long-term 
return for its shareholders and accepting its responsibility for people, the 
environment and society.
Copper cathodes are sheets of copper with a purity level of 99.99 per cent. These copper cathodes from the Rönnskär smelter are transported quickly and 
in an environmentally friendly manner on a train – known as the Copper Shuttle – to customers in southern Sweden and Europe.

THIS IS BOLIDEN / STRATEGIC FOCUS
STRATEGIC  
FOCUS AREAS
Increasing operational efficiency
Base metal prices are set on global 
metal markets and can only be 
affected to a limited extent by the 
metal market players. The com-
petitiveness of mines and smelters 
depends on a high degree of 
capacity utilisation, good produc-
tion stability, and low costs.
Organic growth
Organic growth is about growing 
through the development of exist-
ing operations. Such investments 
are based on well-known assets and 
processes, which often results in low 
risk value generation.
Acquisition of producing mines
The market for mines and smelters 
is relatively fragmented, particu-
larly on the zinc mining side.  
A major consolidation wave can 
generate opportunities for inter-
esting structural deals.
Building up a portfolio of 
 attractive mine projects
A mine’s lifespan is limited. Long-
term growth presupposes, there-
fore, that new ore reserves and 
mineral resources are added to the 
portfolio.
HOW WE WORK
Boliden works towards continuous improve-
ment in its processes with regard to production 
stability and productivity. The work is based on 
a Group-wide organisational and production 
philosophy, the New Boliden Way (Nbw). In 
2009, the Kokkola zinc smelter was the first unit 
to begin using this collective methodology to 
identify areas with scope for improvement.
ACTIVITIES IN 2009
The work on clarifying what the 
New Boliden Way means for the 
production units was intensified. 
The Group’s 140 most senior manag-
ers all completed a three-day course. 
Preparations for implementation on 
a broad front began.
Boliden achieves organic growth through:
•		The	elimination	of	production	bottlenecks,	
which can often be achieved with limited 
 capital investments. 
•		Long-term	investments	in	growth	that	entail	
higher levels of capital investment, for example 
increasing production at mines with long 
lifespans and large ore reserves.
Boliden’s expertise in the production of zinc and 
copper offers good potential for value genera-
tion. This is particularly true of mine assets, 
which can be developed with the aid of expertise 
in mine design, extraction methods and concen-
tration processes.
•		The	final	phase	of	the	Aitik	expan-
sion, which will boost the mine’s 
metal production and extend its 
lifespan to 2029. 
•		Efficiency-enhancing	measures	to	
increase the percentage of elec-
tronic scrap and other secondary 
materials, primarily in Rönnskär’s 
production processes.  
•		Development	of	the	Maurliden	
mine and construction of the new 
Hötjärn tailings pond to enable 
long-term production in the Boli-
den Area.
Boliden continued to monitor and 
analyse developments in the global 
base metals industry. Interesting 
companies and assets are evaluated 
using a number of criteria, such as 
cash cost, production lifespan and 
geographic location.
Boliden has extensive experience of explora-
tion and mining operations. Efforts are cur-
rently focusing on mine-site exploration and 
field exploration in the vicinity of the Group’s 
producing mining areas. Exploration projects 
in partnership with other companies may also, 
in future, help expand the mine portfolio. The 
primary focus is on zinc and copper.
Boliden elected, in response to the 
pronounced deterioration in the glo-
bal economy in the latter half of 
2008, to reduce its field exploration 
activities in order to cut costs. Mine-
site exploration continued. Field 
exploration began again in the latter 
half of 2009, and focused on the 
Skellefte field.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT / MARKET TRENDS
MARKET TRENDS
Global economic development was very weak in 2009. Gnp is calculated 
to have fallen by approximately 2 per cent globally – a figure unequalled 
in modern times. Demand for metals was weak in early 2009 due to the 
continued fall in investments in mature economies’ construction sectors, 
and to the levelling off of growth in emerging countries. Construction 
investments fell for the year as a whole in mature economies, with the 
exception of investments in infrastructure. Construction investments – 
often state financed – did, however increase substantially in China in 
comparison with 2008.
Global production of lightweight vehicles fell sharply at the beginning 
of the year. This trend was halted during the latter half of 2009 when the 
effect of stimulus packages in the form of governmental scrappage pre-
miums in several countries had a positive effect on car sales. Production 
of lightweight vehicles increased sharply in China in comparison with 
2008 as a whole.
Growth increased in China during the second quarter as a result of 
stimulus packages aimed primarily at infrastructural projects. China’s 
imports of zinc metal increased sharply in 2009, as did her imports of 
both copper cathodes and copper concentrate. In 2009, base metal con-
sumption in China exceeded the combined consumption of Europe and 
North America for the first time ever.
The lower level of industrial activity in mature economies was com-
pensated for, to some extent, by measures in the form of governmental 
infrastructural projects, programmes designed to boost demand for dura-
ble consumer goods, and monetary policy stimuli. Demand for base met-
als initially fell sharply but recovered in the latter half of the year as indus-
trial activity improved from initially low levels.
zINC
The price of zinc rose by 129 per cent on the London Metal Exchange 
(Lme) in 2009, reaching Usd 2,570 per tonne by the end of the year. The 
average price of zinc on the London Metal Exchange (Lme) was Usd 1,659 
per tonne in 2009, which was 11 per cent lower than the 2008 average. 
An upward price trend began at the end of March and continued through-
out the year.
Global demand for zinc is estimated to have fallen by approximately 
8 per cent in comparison with 2008. Demand did, however, rise during
the fourth quarter in comparison with both the corresponding period in 
2008 and the third quarter. Demand is estimated to have risen in China 
by 6 per cent. If China is excluded, global demand fell by 16 per cent.  
Production by zinc smelters fell globally by 3 per cent. China’s produc-
tion rose by 11 per cent and if this is excluded, global production fell by 
10 per cent. Imports of zinc metal to China increased sharply in compar-
ison with 2008 as a consequence of the rapid growth in demand.
Official global zinc stocks at Lme and Shanghai Futures Exchange 
(Shfe) increased in 2009 and totalled approximately 660,000 tonnes 
by the end of the year, corresponding to just under 22 days’ global 
consumption.
COPPER
The price of copper rose by 153 per cent on the Lme in 2009, reaching Usd 
7,346 per tonne by the end of the year. The average price for the year was 
Usd 5,164 per tonne, which was 26 per cent lower than in 2008. The price 
of copper began to recover sharply at the end of the first quarter.
Global demand for copper is estimated to have fallen by approximately 
7 per cent in comparison with 2008. Demand is estimated to have risen 
by 6 per cent in China, and if China is excluded, global demand fell by 
16 per cent. Copper cathode consumption is estimated to have fallen 
between the third and fourth quarters, both in China and globally, but 
was higher during the fourth quarter than in the corresponding period 
in 2008.
Global production by copper smelters fell by 2 per cent. Imports of 
copper cathodes and copper concentrate by China increased steeply dur-
ing the year but were slightly lower during the fourth quarter in compari-
son with the third quarter.
Official global copper stock levels increased in 2009 and by the end of 
the year, the combined stock level at Lme, Shfe and Comex totalled 
approximately 697,000 tonnes, corresponding to just under 15 days’ glo-
bal copper consumption.
LEAD
The price of lead rose by 152 per cent on the Lme in 2009, reaching Usd 
2,395 per tonne by the end of the year. The average price in 2009 fell by 
17 per cent in comparison with 2008, to Usd 1,726 per tonne.
zINC – PRICE AND STOCK  
LEVEL TRENDS
The price of zinc rose in 2009 at the same time as 
 global zinc stocks increased. Historically, stocks have 
fallen when prices have risen, and vice versa.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT / MARKET TRENDS
acid production. Demand for sulphuric acid fell at the end of 2008 and 
was very weak in early 2009. Smelters cut production levels in late 2008, 
particularly with regard to copper, because the lower level of demand 
meant that the smelters’ and other players’ sulphuric acid storage capac-
ity was largely full. Weak demand resulted in a sharp fall in the price of 
sulphuric acid from the historically high levels seen in 2008. The market 
balance improved in 2009 and early 2010, when the price increased from 
low levels.
CONCENTRATE MARKET TRENDS
The income earned by the smelters for refining mined concentrate into 
metal is steered by the supply of and demand for mined concentrate 
between mines and smelters. The copper smelters’ income includes a 
refinement charge component for the additional refining into copper, 
gold and silver metals. This stage is absent from the zinc smelters’ proc-
esses and their income accordingly comes exclusively from treatment 
charges. Price escalators, as they are known, ensure that the zinc smelt-
ers bear part of the burden of fluctuations in the price of zinc and price 
changes are, therefore, to some extent, shared by the mines and smelters. 
There has been no price escalator component to treatment and refining 
charges (Tc/Rc) for copper for some years now, and changes in the price 
of copper consequently have no effect on the smelters’ income.
The sharp fall in the price of zinc during the latter half of 2008 neces-
sitated temporary closures of a significant number of mines and zinc con-
centrate availability was consequently lower in early 2009, placing spot 
market treatment charges under pressure. Global production of zinc con-
centrate decreased by 2 per cent in comparison with 2008. Rising zinc 
prices in 2009 resulted in the reopening of much of the previously closed 
mine capacity and mined production of zinc increased by 5 per cent in the 
fourth quarter in comparison with the corresponding period in 2008.
Global production of copper concentrate has been a limiting factor 
during the year. Industrial disputes and technical disruptions at South 
American copper mines had a negative effect on supply. Global copper 
concentrate production has remained largely unchanged for the year as 
a whole in comparison with 2008. China’s substantially increased cop-
per concentrate imports led to a further worsening in the European con-
centrate shortfall. Demand for mined concentrate fell in Europe, how-
Batteries for the automotive industry and industrial applications make 
up the biggest market for lead. Changes in global production of light-
weight vehicles do not affect demand for lead to the same extent as for 
other base metals because the aftermarket for batteries is more stable.
Substantial amounts of smelter capacity in China were shut down, 
either temporarily or permanently, for environmental reasons. At the 
same time, demand for lead in China and other developing countries 
continues to grow as the need for batteries in the automotive industry 
increases.
A considerable percentage of global lead consumption is met using 
recycled metals, and changes in mined production of lead consequently 
have a lesser effect on the price than is the case with other base metals. 
Lead stocks at Lme increased continuously during 2009.
GOLD
The price of gold rose by 25 per cent in 2009 and was Usd 1,096 per ounce 
by the end of the year. The average price for the year was Usd 974 per 
ounce, corresponding to an increase of 12 per cent in comparison with the 
average price in 2008. Gold is increasingly regarded as an important asset 
class by financial investors looking to diversify their portfolios and to 
reduce the amount of risk they are taking in conjunction with financial 
market turbulence, economic decline, and inflation.
SILVER
The price of silver rose by 49 per cent in 2009 and was Usd 16.83 per 
ounce by the end of the year. The average price during the year was Usd 
14.67 per ounce, corresponding to a decrease of 2 per cent in compari-
son with 2008. The price of silver closely tracks gold price trends and, 
as with gold, the metal is to some extent used as a hedge against infla-
tion. The biggest industrial users are manufacturers in the electronics 
and pharmaceutical equipment sectors.
SULPHURIC ACID
Sulphuric acid is a by-product of the smelting process, principally at cop-
per smelters, and is primarily used in the artificial fertiliser, pulp, mining 
and petrochemical industries. Sulphuric acid must be stored in special 
tanks, and smelters must, therefore, have an outlet for their sulphuric
GOLD AND SILVER  
– PRICE TRENDS
Gold and silver are becoming increasingly important 
as an asset class among financial players. The silver 
price generally tracks the gold price trend.
zINC SPOT PREMIUMS IN EUROPE
The spot premium rose slightly during the latter  
half of 2009 from a low level, as a result of a slight 
improvement in demand for zinc.
COPPER PREMIUMS IN EUROPE
The high level of copper metal imports by China 
improved the market balance in Europe in 2009 and 
had a positive effect on European spot premiums.

ever, at the beginning of the year in response to production cutbacks at 
both zinc and copper smelters.
Treatment charges – zinc
Th  e annual treatment charge negotiations for 2009 resulted in bench-
mark contracts in Europe at levels lower than those agreed for 2008.
Zinc treatment charges fell on the spot market during the fi rst quar-
ter in response to the substantial increase in concentrate imports by Chi-
nese smelters, thereby reducing availability of zinc concentrate in other 
regions. Spot market treatment charges increased again slightly during 
the second quarter – a trend that continued into the latter half of the year 
due to the increased availability of mined concentrate. Spot treatment 
charges remained at a lower level, however, than in the yearly contracts 
for 2009. Th  e rise in the price of zinc had a positive eff ect on realised treat-
ment charges, particularly during the latter half of the year. Th  e high ratio 
of internally supplied zinc concentrate means that changes to treatment 
charge conditions have only a limited eff ect on the Boliden Group’s oper-
ating result.
Treatment and refining charges – copper
Copper concentrate availability was limited throughout the year. Th  e 
benchmark contracts for treatment and refi ning charges contracts nego-
tiated at the end of June set the level at Usd 50 per tonne in comparison 
with Usd 75 per tonne in the annual contracts.
Th  e limited concentrate availability meant that treatment and refi ning 
charges in the copper spot market came under pressure and were substan-
tially below the contract level set for 2009. Th  e eff ect was ameliorated 
slightly during the fi rst quarter as a result of the production cutbacks imple-
mented at several smelters in order to handle the limited capacity to store 
the by-product, sulphuric acid, and to balance the lower metal demand. 
Th  e market balance for sulphuric acid improved during the latter half of 
the year, while copper concentrate continued to be in short supply.
METAL PREMIUMS
Boliden’s main metals, zinc and copper, are primarily sold to industrial 
customers in Europe. Th  e regional balance between metal consumption
SALE PRICE COMPONENTS
Th  e price paid by the base metal consumer is based on the LME price, which includes 
the smelters’ income for smelting and refi ning. A metal premium that refl ects, among 
other things, regional supply and demand, is added to this cost.

and smelter capacity determines the level of the metal premiums paid by 
industrial customers.
Contract premiums for zinc were lower in 2009 than in the previous 
year. High levels of copper metal imports to China improved the balance 
between supply and demand in Europe, and the spot premium conse-
quently rose to levels approaching those in the contracts for 2009. Th  e 
benchmark contract for the copper premium was lower than in 2008. 
Lower levels of sales to industrial customers in 2009 also had a negative 
eff ect on metal premium levels.
Weak demand for zinc during the fi rst and second quarters meant that 
spot premiums in mature economies remained at the low levels obtain-
ing at the end of 2008. Spot premiums fell slightly in the Usa during the 
third quarter, but remained stable in Europe and Asia. Th  e premiums 
rose slightly towards the end of the year in Europe.
zINC TREATMENT CHARGES (TC) 
Increased zinc concentrate availability from the sec-
ond quarter of 2009 onwards had a positive eff ect on 
TC. Realised TC were positively aff ected by the rise 
in the price of zinc.
COPPER TREATMENT AND 
 REFINING CHARGES (TC/RC)
Limited global copper concentrate availability put 
downwards pressure on spot market TC/RC to levels 
considerably below the benchmark for 2009.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT / FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2009 IN BRIEF
•		The	operating	profit,	excluding	the	revaluation	of	process	inventory,	
increased by 31 per cent to Sek 2,350 million
•		Stable	production
•		Positive	effects	of	price	hedging	and	a	stronger	Usd counteracted  
the negative effect of lower average metal prices
•	Measures	taken	to	cut	costs
•		Amended	financial	goals
REVENUES
Boliden’s revenues fell by 11 per cent to Sek 27,635 million (Sek 30,987 
m). The strengthening of the Us dollar (Usd) in relation to the average 
exchange rate in 2008 had a positive effect, suppressing the negative 
effects of lower average prices for the majority of metals and the smelt-
ers’ lower production volumes.
PRODUCTION
The mines’ production levels were high and stable in 2009. Zinc produc-
tion increased by 3 per cent, despite the lower production level in the 
Boliden Area during the construction of the new Hötjärn tailings pond 
for waste sand (tailings). Garpenberg and Tara reported consistently high 
production levels with high head grades that fell slightly towards the end 
of the year. Copper production decreased by 5 per cent as a result of sub-
stantially lower grades at Aitik at the end of the third quarter and through-
out the fourth quarter.
The smelters’ production levels fell as a result of the decision to adapt 
production levels in line with the reduced demand for metals. Zinc pro-
duction, which was cut in December 2008, returned to full capacity dur-
ing the third quarter 2009. The copper smelters, where the cutbacks were 
implemented in January, continued at a reduced production level 
throughout the year. The smelters’ combined production of cast zinc 
decreased by 2 per cent, while copper production fell by 14 per cent in 
comparison with 2008.
OPERATING PROFIT
The operating profit increased to Sek 3,623 million (Sek 1,004 m). The 
result includes a positive item totalling Sek 1,273 million (Sek –789 m) from 
the revaluation of the smelters’ process inventory. If the stock revaluation 
is excluded, the operating profit totalled Sek 2,350 million (Sek 1,793 m).
The positive effects on the profit of realised metal price and currency 
hedging and of changes in exchange rates counteracted the effects of lower 
average prices, particularly for copper and zinc, and of the production 
cutbacks at the smelters.
The realised result of metal price and currency hedging was positive, 
totalling Sek 243 million (Sek –349 m). In January 2009, Boliden cur-
rency hedged its planned production of copper, lead, gold and silver in 
2009 and 2010, for which metal price hedging was already in place. The 
currency hedging was achieved at an average Usd/Sek exchange rate of 
8.30 for 2009 and 8.26 for 2010 and covers a substantial percentage of the 
exchange rate risk during these years. For further information on Boli-
den’s metal price and currency hedging, see Note 21 on pages 70–73.
Measures were put in place in late 2008 to adapt Boliden’s body of 
costs in line with the weaker market conditions and to boost the Group’s 
competitiveness. Exploration work was cut back at the beginning of the 
year, but gradually increased during the latter half of the year. The scope 
of maintenance shutdowns at the smelters was also reduced in the spring 
by postponing certain extensive activities until 2010. The reduction in

the numbers of employees and subcontractors was completed as planned 
at the end of June 2009 and resulted in a total reduction in Boliden’s 
workforce of 250 employees and 200 subcontractors – a measure yield-
ing savings of approximately Sek 200 million on a yearly basis. The three-
year programme designed to coordinate and increase the efficiency of 
purchasing processes and to reduce material consumption also proceeded 
according to plan. By the end of 2009, the purchasing programme had 
resulted in savings of just over Sek 100 million on a yearly basis.
Boliden’s operating costs (excluding raw material purchases) fell in local 
currencies by a combined total of 2 per cent as an effect of cost-cutting meas-
ures, primarily with regard to Hr, purchasing and exploration activities. 
Operating costs rose in Sek by 3 per cent in comparison with 2008.
Net financial items improved to Sek –246 million (Sek –281 m), largely 
as a result of lower average interest rates and a higher level of interest cap-
italisation attributable to the Aitik investment. This was, however, coun-
teracted in part by a negative change in the time value of currency options. 
The profit before tax totalled Sek 3,377 million (Sek 723 m).
Reported tax totalled Sek –876 million, in comparison with a positive 
item of Sek 212 million for 2008 due to a tax income yielded by the grant-
ing of a deficit deduction in the Administrative Court of Appeal.
The profit after tax was Sek 2,501 million (Sek 935 m), corresponding
to earnings per share of Sek 9.14 (Sek 3.42).

CASH FLOW
Th  e cash fl ow from operating activities, before investments, totalled Sek 
3,974 million (Sek 5,470 m).  Excessive preliminary tax paid in 2008 was 
refunded, and the tax paid item consequently yielded a positive cash fl ow 
of Sek 70 million (Sek –149 m) in 2009.
Changes in working capital had a negative eff ect of Sek 1,063 million 
(Sek 3,894 m) on the cash fl ow. Th  e increase in the amount of working 
capital was primarily due to the increase in stock levels due to price rises, 
which was counteracted in part by an increase in accounts payable.
Th  e free cash fl ow, after investments, deteriorated to Sek –948 million
(Sek 837 m).
FINANCIAL POSITION
On 31st December 2009, Boliden’s net debt totalled Sek 7,402 million 
(Sek 6,305 m). Shareholders’ equity totalled Sek 16,257 million (Sek 16,131 
m) including the net market valuation of currency, interest and raw mate-
rials derivatives totalling Sek 495 million (Sek 2,602 m) after fi scal eff ects. 
Th  e net debt/equity ratio at this time was 46 per cent (39%), with the 
increase of 7 percentage points due to a deterioration in cash fl ow.
Th  e average term of Boliden’s debt portfolio at the end of the year was 
3.8 years (4.8 yrs). During the second quarter, interest swaps were used 
to extend the fi xed interest term. Th  e average interest level on the debt 
portfolio on 31st December 2009 was 2.62 per cent (5.18%) and the fi xed 
interest term was 2.1 years (0.2 yrs).
At the end of the year, Boliden’s current liquidity totalled Sek 6,924 
million (Sek 8,319 m), comprising liquid assets and unutilised binding 
credit facilities less commercial papers issued.

INVESTMENTS
Boliden’s total assets increased from Sek 30,252 million at the beginning 
of the year to Sek 33,258 million on 31st December 2009. Tangible fi xed 
assets increased from Sek 17,192 million to Sek 20,454 million.
Investments in tangible assets totalled Sek 4,912 million (Sek 4,621 m). 
Th  e higher investment level is due to the Aitik expansion, which had 
entered its fi nal investment phase by the end of the year. Investment activ-
ities have been moderate throughout the year, with the exception of the 
Aitik expansion.
Boliden’s capital employed increased by Sek 1,496 million to Sek 
26,229 million (Sek 24,733 m). Th  e increase is due in its entirety to invest-
ments made during the year.
BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING 
COSTS
Operating costs (excluding raw material purchases) 
fell by 2 per cent in 2009 in local currencies. In SEK, 
costs increased by 3 per cent.
INVESTMENTS 
Th  e increased investments in recent years are due to 
the expansion of the Aitik copper mine. A total of 
SEK 2,982 million was invested in the Aitik expan-
sion in 2009.
FREE CASH FLOW 
Th  e reduction in free cash fl ow is due to the Aitik 
expansion and to an increase in working capital tied 
up as a result of the rise in metal prices in 2009.

Boliden’s profitability is affected to a considerable degree by external 
factors such as global industrial production and metal price and 
exchange rate trends. Boliden’s policy is, therefore, not to issue fore-
casts with regard to profit performance because such forecasts would 
largely be based on factors over which the Group has no control. Boli-
den does, however, provide quarterly analyses of the operating profit’s 
sensitivity to changes in metal prices, exchange rates and treatment and 
refining charges in its interim reports and preliminary financial state-
ment. Note 21 on pages 71–72 contains a sensitivity analysis of the way 
in which changes since 31st December 2009 will affect the Group’s oper-
ating profit over the following 12-month period.
FINANCIAL GOALS AND GOAL FULFILMENT 
Boliden operates in a cyclic and capital-intensive industry, where 
growth is primarily achieved through investments in new production, 
expanded capacity, and improved productivity. Good profitability and 
financial stability are vital to sustainable growth and long-term value 
generation. It is against this background that Boliden’s financial goals 
have been revised in conjunction with the 2009 Year End Report.
Return on capital employed
Boliden’s goal is a return on capital employed that shall exceed 10 per 
cent over a business cycle. In order to achieve this goal, Boliden both 
endeavours to increase its productivity and to cut costs, and to increase 
the efficiency of both its financial and its material flows, thereby reduc-
ing the amount of capital tied up. The return on capital employed in 
2009 totalled 14 per cent (5%). The increased return is due to the improve-
ment in the profit.
The average return during the period from 2005 to 2009 was 24 per
cent per annum.
Capital structure
The goal is for the net debt/equity ratio in an economic upturn to be 
no higher than 20 per cent, in order to maintain a reasonable financial 
ability to act in a recession.
The net debt/equity ratio at the end of 2009 was 46 per cent (39%) 
with the increase primarily due to a deterioration in cash flow for the year 
as a whole.
The net debt/equity ratio during the last five-year period has ranged
between –1 and 54 per cent.
Dividend
Boliden’s policy states that the dividend shall correspond to approxi-
mately one third of the net profit.
The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of Sek 3 per share, or a 
total of Sek 821 million, for 2009, corresponding to 32.8 per cent of the 
net profit for the year. The ordinary dividend payments during the period 
from 2005 to 2009, including the proposed dividend for 2009, corre-
spond to 25.3 per cent of the aggregate net result for the period.
PRINCIPLES FOR REMUNERATION TO THE PRESIDENT AND 
OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES
The current remuneration principles are shown in Note 1 on pages 
57–58. The Board of Directors will propose to the 2010 Annual Gen-
eral Meeting of the shareholders of the company that variable remu-
neration may total a maximum of 60 per cent, in comparison with 50 
per cent in 2009. It is proposed that the principles shall otherwise 
remain unchanged.
THE PARENT COMPANY
The Parent Company conducts no operations and has no employees. 
The Income Statements and Balance Sheets for the Parent Company 
are shown on page 50 of the Annual Accounts.
CAPITAL EMPLOYED AND RETURN
The return on capital employed was 14 per cent in 
2009. The average return per annum for the period 
from 2005 to 2009 was 24 per cent.
NET DEBT AND DEBT 
/EQUITY RATIO
The net debt/equity ratio increased to 46 per cent in 
2009, primarily as a result of the decline in the cash 
flow.
DIVIDEND PER SHARE
Boliden’s dividend goal is to pay approximately  
one third of the net profit in dividends per year.  
The  dividend percentage for 2009 is 32.8 per cent.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT / BUSINESS AREA MINES
BUSINESS AREA MINES
BUSINESS AREA MINES IN BRIEF 
Business Area Mines conducts exploration, mining and concentration 
operations in Sweden and Ireland. Th  e main products are zinc and  copper 
concentrate, but the ores’ gold, silver and lead content is also important 
in terms of the mines’ costs position and profi tability. Th  e mines’ produc-
tion is sold both to the Group’s own smelters and to external customers. 
Th  e exploration activities are primarily carried out in the vicinity of exist-
ing mining areas and the aim at all times is for all mining areas to have ore 
reserves and mineral deposits that secure production for at least the next 
ten years. Boliden’s mines are among the world leaders when it comes to 
productivity and technology. Development is driven by the fact that many 
of the mining areas have low metal grades, thereby increasing the require-
ment for high levels of both productivity and cost eff ectiveness.
2009 IN BRIEF
•		Th	 e	operating	profi	t	increased	by	194	per	cent	to	Sek 2,159 million (Sek 
734 m) due to exchange rate fl uctuations, improved profi ts from price 
hedging, and positive volume eff ects. 
•		Th	 e	expansion	of	the	Aitik	copper	mine	proceeded	according	to	plan	
in terms of both scheduling and investment frameworks. 
•		Garpenberg	increased	its	zinc	production	by	7	per	cent	and	achieved	a	
new production record. 
•		Tara’s	effi		ciency-enhancing	action	programme	helped	improve	the	
mine’s production and cut costs. A new grinding mill became opera-
tional during the fourth quarter and will cut costs still further. 
•		Preparations	for	the	start	of	production	at	Maurliden	continued	in	the	
Boliden Area, as did work on the construction of the Hötjärn tailings 
pond, which is scheduled to become operational during the third quar-
ter of 2010.

PRODUCTION
Metal grades exceeded the ore reserves’ average levels up until the end of 
the third quarter, when they fell back to lower levels.
Zinc production increased by 3 per cent in comparison with 2008, 
with the change primarily due to high metal grades at Tara and Garpen-
berg throughout most of the year and to stable ore production. Garpen-
berg’s zinc production increased by 7 per cent to just over 90,000 tonnes, 
which was a new record level.
Copper production decreased by 5 per cent due to substantially lower 
grades at Aitik at the end of the year. Aitik’s copper grade for the year as 
a whole was 0.27 per cent, in comparison with 0.30 in 2008. During the 
fourth quarter, Aitik intensifi ed its preparations for the start of produc-
tion at the new facility.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT / BUSINESS AREA MINES
An expansion project that will double ore production to 36 million tonnes per year is taking place at the Aitik copper mine between 2007 and 2010. With the 
current production plan and ore reserves, Aitik’s lifespan extends until 2029.
Gold production increased by 20 per cent while silver production 
remained on a par with levels in 2008. This was due to Aitik’s higher 
throughput and yield, higher silver grades at Garpenberg, and higher 
grades and good yields in the Boliden Area.
Lead production was 7 per cent up in comparison with 2008 as a result
of higher lead grades at Garpenberg.
Cutbacks in the Boliden Area continued in 2009 during the ongoing 
construction of the new Hötjärn tailings pond. The construction work 
will continue in 2010 and the Boliden Area is expected to increase pro-
duction levels during the third quarter when production starts at Maur-
liden, and to reach full capacity at the end of the year.

REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT
The majority of Business Area Mines’ sales are made to the Group’s 
 smelters, with a smaller percentage sold to external smelters. All sales are 
made on market terms.
Revenues rose by 26 per cent to Sek 6,509 million (Sek 5,178 m) in com-
parison with 2008. The operating profit increased during the same period 
by 194 per cent to Sek 2,159 million (Sek 734 m), an improvement which 
was mainly due to fluctuations in exchange rates and improved realised 
results from metal price and currency hedging. This was countered, to 
some extent, by lower average metal prices than in 2008 and by the fact 
that the rise in the price of zinc during the year resulted in higher realised 
zinc treatment charges. Increased production as a result of higher vol-
umes of concentrated ore had a positive effect on the profit.
Net operating costs remained unchanged in local currencies. Explo-
ration and Hr costs fell, while energy costs rose.
An action programme designed to enhance efficiency, and which 
included continuous shifts, was launched at Tara in early 2009, with the 
aim of improving profitability. A new grinding mill was installed in Tara’s 
concentrator during the fourth quarter, and will result in both lower 
grinding costs and an improved zinc yield.
STRATEGIC FOCUS
Generating results and cash flows that supply the required return depends 
on achieving a competitive cost position and the Business Area conse-
quently endeavours to achieve ongoing improvements in every aspect of 
its operations. The New Boliden Way programme has been introduced 
in 2009 and an extensive pilot programme is currently in progress at the 
Kristineberg mine. Once evaluation work is completed, the project will 
be rolled out at other units. Continuous improvements to processes and 
equipment and optimum exploitation of know-how and technical solu-
tions will be important ingredients in a comprehensive development pro-
gramme over the next few years.
Developing employees’ skills and ensuring knowledge transfer will be
important factors in achieving success.

THE AITIK EXPANSION PROJECT
The Aitik expansion project, which runs between 2007 and 2010, is one 
of Sweden’s biggest industrial projects. 2009 was the project’s most inten-
sive year. The expansion will see Aitik’s lifespan extended from 2016 to 
2029 and its ore extraction doubled from 18 to 36 million tonnes per year. 
Competitiveness is being boosted through efficient large-scale produc-
tion that enables low grade ore to be mined profitably.
The investment entails the construction of a completely new concen-
trator, with new infrastructure and new logistics solutions. The mining 
area’s average metal grade will be lower in the long term, but the increased 
level of ore extraction and concentration capacity will mean an increase 
in copper concentrate production of approximately 50 per cent in com-
parison with the average during the period from 2007 to 2009.
Measures implemented in 2009 included the provision of training in 
the run up to the commissioning of the new concentrator. The first pro-
duction line is scheduled to become operational on 1st April 2010 with 
the second production line becoming operational on 1st July that year. 
Aitik’s ore production and concentration is expected to increase to 31 mil-
lion tonnes in 2010. Full capacity of 36 million tonnes ore will be achieved 
in 2014.
Once the expansion project is completed, Aitik will be one of the 
world’s most productive, technically advanced and eco-friendly mines. 
Mining production and concentration costs will fall, despite the lower 
average grades, resulting in an improvement in Aitik’s competitiveness 
in relation to other copper mines worldwide.
The total amount scheduled for investment in the Aitik expansion is 
estimated at approximately Sek 6.1 billion, including Sek 2,982 million 
in 2009. Investments in the Aitik project have totalled Sek 5,629 million 
during the period from 2007 to 2009.
EXPLORATION
Boliden’s long-term growth depends on its mineral resources and ore 
reserves – which are the Group’s primary assets – growing faster than its 
ore production, and successful exploration is, therefore, vital to long-term 
mining operations and metal production. The primary focus of Boliden’s 
exploration is on zinc-, copper- and precious metal-bearing ores. The goal 
is to secure ore reserves corresponding to ten years’ production in all of 
the Group’s mining areas and, in the long term, to expand the explor-
ation portfolio in the form of additional mining areas. The majority of 
the exploration work is conducted in the vicinity of existing mines (mine-
site exploration), but field exploration is also conducted in Sweden and 
Ireland in parallel with the mine-site exploration. The methods and tech-
nologies are constantly improving, and this has, among other things, 
 enabled deposits to be discovered at greater depths than before. Boliden’s 
own Em34 technology for geophysical measurements, which has been 
further developed and can now also be used in conjunction with drill hole 
measurements, is one example of this improvement.
The investments in exploration account for the majority of the Group’s 
reported R&d costs. Boliden has successively increased its investments in 
exploration since 2003 and these additional activities have made signifi-
cant net contributions to the mineral deposits and ore reserves, particu-
larly at Garpenberg and Aitik, but also in the Boliden Area.
The sharp slowdown in the global economy during the latter half of 
2008, and the resulting fall in base metal prices, meant, however, that 
Boliden – in common with other mining and exploration companies – 
elected to implement cutbacks in its exploration activities, in order to cut 
costs. The cutbacks primarily related to field exploration, while mine-site 
exploration activities remained at relatively unchanged levels.

A number of mine-site exploration successes in 2009 led to an increase 
in mineral resources. The trend was particularly positive at Salmijärvi and 
Liikavaara in Aitik and at Kristineberg and Renström in the Boliden Area, 
and has resulted in an extension of Aitik’s lifespan from 2026 to 2029.
More information on the calculation of ore reserves and mineral 
resources can be read on pages 79–82. Certain field exploration projects 
were re-launched during the latter half of the year, particularly in the 
 Skellefte field.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT / BUSINESS AREA MINES
THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPLORATION PROJECTS
Boliden’s exploration activities are primarily conducted in existing mining areas 
(mine-site exploration), and focus on zinc-, copper- and precious metal-bearing ores. 
A certain amount of fi eld exploration work, looking for deposits in new areas, is also 
carried out in Sweden and Ireland. New deposits in the vicinity of mines that are 
already producing can be brought on line more quickly compared with deposits in 
new areas because important infrastructure and equipment are already on site. Explor-
ation work was particularly successful in 2009 at Salmijärvi, Liikavaara, Kristineberg 
and Renström.

THE 10 BIGGEST zINC MINING PLAYERS
Boliden is one of the world’s ten biggest players in the zinc mining sector and the third 
biggest player in Europe. Th  e market for zinc concentrate is relatively fragmented, 
with larger numbers of smaller players than is the case in the  copper market.
THE 10 BIGGEST COPPER MINING PLAYERS
Boliden is, with its production of approximately 55,000 tonnes of copper con-
centrate, a relatively small copper mining player in global terms. Boliden is 
the third biggest producer in Europe.

boliden Annual Report 2009
The Tara underground mine is Europe’s biggest zinc mine 
and the world’s fifth biggest. Tara’s products are zinc and 
lead concentrate, and the mine was acquired by Boliden in 
early 2004. Production at the mine began in 1977, and 
since then over 70 million tonnes of ore have been mined. 
The  ore  reserve  and  mineral  resources  have  been 
increased, both through exploration and through acquisi-
tions. In recent years, Tara has focused on improving its 
cost position, measured as cash cost, through investments 
designed to boost productivity and saving measures.
The deposits at Garpenberg were first worked as far back 
as the 13th century, making Garpenberg Sweden’s oldest 
mine that is still operational. Boliden acquired Garpenberg 
in 1957 and successful exploration work has since cre-
ated a mining area that now has substantial ore reserves 
and a long lifespan. Complex ore that contains zinc, cop-
per, lead, gold and silver is mined at Garpenberg, and it is 
this metal mix that has contributed to the area’s extremely 
favourable cost position.

The Boliden Area is located in the mineral-rich Skellefte 
field, where almost 30 mines have been operated since 
production began in the 1920s. The area nowadays com-
prises the Renström and Kristineberg underground mines. 
The construction of a new tailings pond, the Hötjärn tail-
ings pond, means that the Boliden Area is producing at a 
lower level during 2008 and 2009 and in the first six 
months of 2010. The Maurliden open pit mine is being 
prepared for production to start in 2010. All three mines 
produce complex ore that contains zinc, copper, lead, gold 
and silver. Exploration successes have gradually increased 
the Boliden Area’s lifespan.

The Aitik open pit mine is Boliden’s biggest mine, and pro-
duces copper ore that also contains gold and silver. The 
metal grades are low but are compensated for by high lev-
els of productivity and efficient concentration processes. 
An expansion project that will double Aitik’s ore production 
to 36 million tonnes and increase copper production by 
50 per cent is being implemented between 2007 and 
2010. The new concentrator will be commissioned in two 
stages, on 1st April and 1st July 2010. Production will 
then be successively ramped up until it reaches full capac-
ity. The expansion will generate the potential for extract-
ing additional ore and this, coupled with positive explora-
tion results, will extend Aitik’s lifespan from 2016 to 
2029.

BUSINESS AREA SMELTERS IN BRIEF
Business Area Smelters refi nes both metal concentrate and secondary 
materials to produce high quality base and precious metals at smelters in 
Sweden, Finland and Norway. Th  e metals produced are zinc, copper, 
lead, gold and silver. Business Area Smelters also produces sulphuric acid 
and aluminium fl uoride and refi nes nickel concentrate. Over the years, 
Business Area Smelters has developed advanced techniques and fl exible 
processes that enable numerous diff erent kinds of raw material to be pro-
cessed in an eco-friendly way and a high percentage of the raw material’s 
metal content to be extracted.

PRODUCTION
Capacity utilisation levels at both zinc and copper smelters were down 
in 2009 due to weak demand.
Zinc production fell by 2 per cent in comparison with 2008, due to 
the cutbacks implemented in December last year in order to adapt the 
smelters’ zinc production in line with lower levels of demand. Th  e zinc 
smelters returned to full production in the third quarter of 2009 and pro-
duced at a stable, high level throughout the rest of the year.
Th  e copper smelters, whose production was cut in January, contin-
ued at a lower production level throughout the year, and copper cathode 
production fell overall by 14 per cent in comparison with 2008. Th  e cut-
back was a consequence of unfavourable treatment and refi ning charge 
terms and of very unfavourable terms for sulphuric acid. Th  e sulphuric 
acid market did gradually improve during the year, but the shortage of 
copper concentrate continued. Copper concentrate market conditions 
meant that the cutbacks to the smelters’ copper production continued 
in early 2010.

Gold production decreased by 3 per cent while silver production increased 
by 11 per cent. Th  e continued high volumes are a result of the high pre-
cious metal grades in the copper concentrate bought in and to Rönnskär’s 
production incorporating an increased percentage of electronic scrap.

Bergsöe’s production of lead fell by 9 per cent as a result of scrap car bat-

Rönnskär.
Maintenance shutdowns were implemented at all smelters during the 
year, but a more extensive maintenance shutdown at Rönnskär was post-
poned until 2010.
REVENUES AND PROFIT
Revenues decreased by 14 per cent to Sek 26,765 million (Sek 31,256 m) 
in comparison with 2008, primarily as a result of lower average prices and 
the production cutbacks instituted.
Th  e operating profi t, excluding the revaluation of the smelters’ pro-
cess inventory, decreased to Sek 451 million (Sek 1,162 m) as an eff ect of 
the production cutbacks and deteriorations in prices and terms.
If the positive revaluation eff ect of Sek 1,273 million (Sek –789 m) is
included, the operating profi t totalled Sek 1,724 million (Sek 372 m).
If stock inventory revaluations are excluded, deteriorations in prices 
and terms had the biggest impact on the profi t, with a combined nega-
tive eff ect of Sek 633 million.
Th  e copper smelters received, as the copper concentrate market situation 
worsened, lower treatment and refi ning charges on the spot market.
Realised treatment charges for the zinc smelters, which, thanks to price 
sharing mechanisms, benefi t from rises in the price of zinc, have gradu-
ally improved during the year. Th  e rise in the price of zinc also had a posi-
tive eff ect on the smelters’ profi ts derived from so-called free metals.
Th  e percentage of zinc and copper sales to industrial customers 
increased during the latter half of the year, entailing an increase in the 
income from metal premiums.
Lower production volumes had a negative eff ect on the profi t of Sek
458 million in comparison with 2008.
Operating costs in local currencies (excluding raw materials bought 
in) fell slightly. Th  e reduction was a consequence both of across-the-board 
cost-cutting measures and of the reductions in volume. At the same time, 
energy costs increased in Sek by 11 per cent.

STRATEGIC FOCUS AREAS AND ACTIVITIES
The key focus area for Business Area Smelters is on achieving further 
improvements in process stability and on enhancing the efficiency of the 
production. The primary means used to achieve these goals are improve-
ments in methodologies and processes that rationalise capital usage and 
increase the smelters’ yields, that is the percentage of metal extracted from 
the raw material. The ongoing work on enhancing energy efficiency is 
also of considerable importance. The basis for the improvements is the 
New  Boliden Way (Nbw), Boliden’s organisational and operational phi-
losophy. The Kokkola zinc smelter, which had previously implemented 
a pilot project designed to identify areas where scope for improvement 
existed in the casting house, expanded the work in 2009 to comprise the 
full range of its operations. Work on the Nbw began at Rönnskär during 
the year and the other smelters will follow suit in early 2010.
The Business Area’s efforts are primarily focused on eliminating bottle-
necks and thereby increasing the capacity for secondary materials. Con-
tinuous improvements enabled Rönnskär to increase its electronic scrap 
capacity in 2009 as well.
Business Area Smelters is also working intensively to secure long-term 
raw materials availability. The biggest challenge in the raw materials field 
is on the copper side of operations, in that production by the Group’s 
mines only covers approximately 20 per cent of production capacity. This 
situation is exacerbated by the stiff global competition for mined con-
centrate. Internal supplies will increase to around the 25 per cent level 
when Aitik reaches full capacity after the expansion, and this higher per-
centage of familiar concentrate will enable the copper smelters to refine 
externally purchased concentrate that contains impurities, for which 
 better treatment and refining charges apply.
Efforts on the zinc side of operations are focused on further expanding 
the customer base. Customer relations will be intensified through increased 
investments in customer service and by developing the product proper-
ties – work that is often carried out in cooperation with the customers.
The focus within copper is on a geographic expansion of the customer
base, principally in Central and Eastern Europe.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Business Area Smelters’ research and development work focuses primar-
ily on the further development of the smelting and refining processes. 
Business Area Smelters has developed a number of smelting and refining 
techniques over the years, including the so-called direct leaching method 
used by the zinc smelters. The metal concentrates extracted from the 
world’s mines are increasingly complex and demand more of the smelt-
ers in terms of their ability to refine material with substantial impurities, 
while maintaining a high level of environmental friendliness. Those 
smelters which have the ability to process numerous different kinds of 
secondary materials, such as electronic and metal scrap and lead batter-
ies, will increasingly see their competitiveness grow.
Anode casting is one of the later stages in the smelters’ copper production process. The anodes contain 98 per cent copper and when they are refined  
to produce copper cathodes, other valuable metals, such as gold and silver, can be extracted and refined.

BOLIDEN’S SMELTERS
THE KOKKOLA zINC SMELTER
The Kokkola smelter in Finland is the world’s fifth biggest 
zinc smelter and produces alloys that are used in galvanis-
ing. The zinc concentrate is delivered by ship to Kokkola’s 
own port, both from Boliden’s own mines and from exter-
nal suppliers. Kokkola uses the in-house developed direct 
leaching method that enables it to process complex and 
less pure metal concentrates.

THE ODDA zINC SMELTER
The Odda zinc smelter is located on the west coast of Nor-
way and produces zinc for the steel industry and alumin-
ium fluoride for the Norwegian aluminium industry. Odda, 
which was founded back in 1929, has its own ice-free port 
used for incoming deliveries of zinc concentrate and other 
raw materials, and for outgoing shipments of finished met-
als. Much of the zinc concentrate is delivered from Tara, 
the Boliden Area and Garpenberg. Odda, like Kokkola, uses 
the direct leaching method.

THE RÖNNSKÄR COPPER SMELTER
The Rönnskär copper smelter is located in Skelleftehamn 
in northern Sweden. Its main products are copper, zinc 
clinker, lead and precious metals, and its by-products 
include sulphuric acid. Rönnskär’s Kaldo and fuming plants 
enable it to complement its copper production with the 
recycling of metals from electronic scrap and other sec-
ondary materials, which accounts for approximately 20 
per cent of production. Rönnskär processes Boliden’s 
entire internal production of copper concentrate, which 
will cover approximately 50 per cent of Rönnskär’s require-
ments once the Aitik expansion is completed.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
DIRECTORS’ REPORT/SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
It is impossible to overestimate the importance of high quality work with 
environmental and safety issues for a company in the metals industry. 
Boliden’s vision is to be a world-class metals partner, which presupposes 
taking long-term responsibility for our operations’ environmental impact 
and good relationships with employees, customers, suppliers,  shareholders 
and everyone else who is affected in any way by our operations.
All of Boliden’s mines and smelters are operated in accordance with 
applicable legislation and environmental licenses in every country in 
which the company operates. In many cases, Boliden’s own goals exceed 
those set by applicable legislation. This ensures that our sustainability 
work is conducted in a proactive way, thereby facilitating adaptations in 
line with market conditions and with future legislation and regulations, 
and strengthening our relationships with important stakeholder groups. 
For further information on Boliden’s sustainability work, please visit Boli-
den’s website at www.boliden.com or see Boliden’s separate  Sustainability 
Report.
MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
Boliden’s strategic work with sustainability issues is a permanent item on 
the agenda at every meeting of the Group’s management group, in order 
to ensure that our work in this area is more systematic. The work is based 
on a management style that involves the employees and makes them par-
ticipants in issues that relate to people, the environment and society.
In order to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge and experience 
between the Business Areas and production units, Boliden has set up 
Group-wide networks for environment, health, safety and quality, Hr 
and Communication issues. The Ehsq staff function works with four 
specialised networks based at the Group’s units, while the personnel net-
work is a broader one and comprises Hr Managers. The communications 
network is responsible for communicating the Group’s goals and strate-
gies and for spreading good examples and developing relationships with 
Boliden’s stakeholder groups. The heads of the various networks report 
continuously to the Group management team.
Every unit undergoes an internal audit every other year with regard to 
the environment, health, safety and quality issues, and which is based on 
policies and standards. Internal audits were carried out at the Odda and 
Bergsöe smelters and at the Tara, Garpenberg and Aitik mines in 2009.
A safe work environment
Boliden has reported a positive trend with regard to accidents at work in 
the last few years. Investments in safe machines, the use of protective 
equipment, and risk analyses are all important aspects of our health and 
safety work. The most important factor, however, is our efforts to ensure 
that attitudes, routines and behaviour prevent accidents.
The goal for every unit is a zero accident rate. The accident frequency 
in 2009 fell to 5.5 (9.1) accidents per 1 million hours worked. Efforts to 
raise safety awareness and make it even clearer to employees how their 
behaviour can improve safety continued, and the system for reporting 
incidents and accidents was improved.
All of Boliden’s production units are certified in accordance with the
Ohsas 18001 work environment standard.
Health and lifestyle programmes
Absences due to sickness and ill health within Boliden are not primarily 
work-related; rather they are increasingly due to lifestyle factors. All units 
within Boliden have consequently implemented action programmes 
aimed at promoting employees’ health and, in the long term, reducing 
absence due to sickness.
The absence due to sickness rate in 2009 was 4.2 per cent (4.7%), in
comparison with our goal of 4.0 per cent by the end of 2013.
Equal opportunities and diversity
Boliden aims to increase the number of different nationalities among its 
workforce, and indeed, previous years’ recruitment activities within Busi-
ness Area Mines’ exploration operations and the investments within BA 
Smelters’ marketing organisation have resulted in an increase in the 
number of nationalities within the Group.
The metals industry is traditionally male-dominated, and efforts to 
interest women in the metals industry and Boliden have intensified in 
recent years. An equal opportunities workplace generates dynamism and 
increases motivation within the organisation, and is hence a factor that 
can enhance Boliden’s attractiveness as an employer.
By the end of 2009, 15 per cent (14%) of the Group’s employees were
female.
NEW BOLIDEN WAY
Boliden’s operations have been based, since 2005, on a Group-wide organ-
isational and operational philosophy – the New Boliden Way (Nbw). 
Work on concretising what Nbw means for the production units began 
in 2009. Productivity will be improved, resource wastage reduced, and 
costs cut in order to strengthen Boliden’s competitiveness. An annually 
recurring development and training programme was launched for 140 
operations managers with the focus, this year, on leadership and work 
methodology based on Nbw.
EMPLOYEES
The average number of Group employees in 2009 was 4,379 (4,608), 2,257 
(2,469) of whom work in Business Area Smelters, 2,032 (2,057) of whom 
work in Business Area Mines, and 90 (82) work in Group staff functions 
and Group-wide functions. The reduction in numbers was due to the 
staff cuts of 250 approved in 2008 and implemented in 2008 and 2009.  
A significant percentage of Boliden’s employees will retire over the next 
five years. A manager evaluation model was introduced in 2009 to increase 
transparency and make it easier to identify skill requirements within the 
Group.
ACCIDENT FREQUENCY 
Number of accidents per one million 
hours worked. The goal is zero acci-
dents per unit.
SICK-LEAVE RATE 
The sick-leave rate fell to 4.2% in 
2009. The goal is to reach 4.0% by 
the end of 2013.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT/SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Boliden has a responsibility to minimise the impact of the operations on 
the environment. The environmental impact varies in degree, depend-
ing on the point in the value chain. Exploration, for example, does not, 
in itself, have any significant impact on the environment, while mining 
affects the environment in the form of changes to the landscape, noise 
and vibrations. Mining operations also give rise to waste, dust, and emis-
sions and discharges of metals to air and water. Smelters do not normally 
require as much land area as mines, but their processes demand large 
amounts of energy and give rise to metal emissions and discharges to air 
and water.
Operations at all of Boliden’s units require licenses and permits and 
are conducted in accordance both with applicable environmental legis-
lation and other regulations in Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Norway, 
and with Eu regulations governing the handling of waste, chemicals and 
carbon dioxide emissions, among others.
Environmental work
Boliden works with its own environmental goals and guidelines, thereby 
not only ensuring compliance with existing laws and regulations, but also 
facilitating adaptation in line with anticipated future requirements. All 
of Boliden’s production units have environmental management systems 
certified in accordance with Iso 14001. Boliden’s environmental goals are 
set on the basis of the Group’s most significant environmental factors. 
Group-wide goals have been set for the period from 2009 to 2013 with
regard to emissions and discharges of metals to air and water, and sul-
phur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, all of which have 2007 as the 
base comparison year. The goals have been broken down by the vari ous 
production units in order to facilitate follow-up work. These goals are 
reported every month and aggregated to produce measurements for the 
Group as a whole.
The environmental impact of metal production does not, however, 
result solely from Boliden’s own processes. Metal production takes place 
as part of a chain of extraction, refining and recycling activities that 
require large amounts of materials to be processed and delivered, includ-
ing to external players. Boliden has no direct influence over the environ-
mental work of the Group’s business partners but can, through supplier 
and customer evaluations, work to ensure compliance with agreed poli-
cies and instructions. In 2009, Boliden initiated a project aimed at fur-
ther strengthening its own routines in connection with this work.
Energy consumption
The production of metals is an energy-intensive process, and this is par-
ticularly true of the smelters’ processes. The origin of the electricity 
 Boliden uses is determined by the so-called national mix provided by the 
respective operating countries’ electricity grids.
Boliden’s smelters are among the most energy-efficient in the world, 
but energy still accounts for approximately 18 per cent of the Group’s 
operating costs. Electricity consumption in 2009 totalled 3.3 TWh (3.4 
TWh), and this figure is expected to increase by approximately 0.6 TWh

RESULT IN 2009
•		The	Group’s	accident	frequency	fell	from	9.1	accidents	per	1	million	hours	worked	 
to 5.5 in 2009. The nine operating units had an average of nine accident-free months 
 during the year.

•		Discharges	of	metals	to	water	fell	by	50	per	cent	in	comparison	with	2007	as	a	result	 
of the new water purification plants at Odda and Harjavalta, lower amounts of precipi-
tation, and fewer production disruptions. 
•		Metal	emissions	to	air	fell	by	40	per	cent	in	comparison	with	2007,	primarily	 
as a result of a generally good performance by the filtering plants. 
•		Sulphur	dioxide	emissions	to	air	fell	by	14	per	cent	in	comparison	with	2007	 
as a result of fewer operational stoppages and reduced production.
•		Carbon	dioxide	emissions	increased	by	3	per	cent	in	comparison	with	2007	due	to	
changes in the reporting method at the Rönnskär copper smelter. If this effect is 
excluded, carbon dioxide emissions fell by 8 per cent.
Boliden’s efforts to achieve its sustainability goals and other objectives with regard to promoting long-term sustainable development are described 
in the Sustainability Report, published in March 2010.

boliden Annual Report 2009
DIRECTORS’ REPORT/SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
The operations at Boliden’s production units are subject to licensing which means, among other things, that regular emissions measurements are required. 
In the picture, Vanje Lindberg, who is a certified Environmental Sampling Officer in the Boliden Area, takes water samples to check metal levels.
in 2010 when the Aitik copper mine begins producing at substantially 
increased capacity levels. At the same time, however, the investment in 
Aitik includes new infrastructure and logistics measures that are consid-
erably more energy-efficient than previous solutions.
All of Boliden’s production units have implemented energy manage-
ment systems, either as distinct systems or as part of the Iso 14001 envi-
ronmental management system. The smelters take the waste heat from 
their processes and use it to heat their own premises. Several of the smelt-
ers also supply waste heat to local district heating plants.
Boliden has a Group-wide energy policy that stipulates, among other 
things, that every unit shall endeavour to increase the efficiency of its 
energy consumption, in order both to reduce its environmental impact 
and to cut its operating costs. Enhanced energy efficiency is, just as with 
other process improvements, an ongoing process in which the work must 
be conducted systematically. Energy analyses and costings are conducted 
as part of the exploration work and are then used when planning and 
choosing machinery and other equipment.
Carbon dioxide emission rights
Two of Boliden’s production units – the Rönnskär copper smelter and 
the Bergsöe lead smelter – are covered by the Eu’s current system for trad-
ing in emission rights. The two smelters had emission rights  corresponding 
to 78,909 tonnes of carbon dioxide for the period from 2008 to 2012. 
When the Eu’s new legislation for the allocation of emission rights comes 
into force in 2013, all of Boliden’s mines and smelters will be covered by 
the trading system.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT/ RISKS
RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk taking and the management of risk factors are a natural part of all 
business operations. Boliden’s risk exposure is divided into market and 
commercial risks, operational risks and financial risks. Information on 
legal proceedings and disputes is provided in Note 23 on page 73.
Market and commercial risks are primarily managed at Business Area 
level. Operational risks are managed by the operating units in accord-
ance with guidelines and instructions laid down for each Business Area 
and at Group level.
Financial risks are managed centrally within Boliden’s treasury func-
tion. The treasury function is responsible for identifying and efficiently 
limiting the Group’s financial risks in accordance with the financial pol-
icy set by the Board of Directors.
MARKET AND COMMERCIAL RISKS
Global economic trends in general, and global industrial production in 
particular, affect demand and pricing trends for zinc, copper and other 
base metals. Boliden’s customers are primarily steel companies and manu-
facturers of semi-finished goods in Europe who, in turn, sell their prod-
ucts to the European automotive, construction and electronics indus-
tries. Activity levels in these industries affect demand for Boliden’s metals 
and, hence, the Group’s profitability.
Changes to prices and terms
Changes to metal prices and treatment and refining charge terms have a 
significant impact on Boliden’s profit performance.
Metal prices
Metal prices are set daily on the London Metal Exchange (Lme). Boli-
den’s policy is not to hedge its mines’ production of metals against metal 
prices, although deviations from this policy are permitted under special 
circumstances. Approximately two thirds of copper production during 
the period from 2007 to 2010, and some of the lead, gold and silver pro-
duction have, for example, been price hedged in order to secure the 
investments in the expansion of the Aitik copper mine.
The smelters are, by and large, naturally hedged against metal price 
fluctuations, in that treatment and refining charges are the primary com-
ponents of their income. Some impact does result from the zinc smelt-
ers’ price escalators and the extraction of so-called free metals, which are 
fully exposed to fluctuations in metal prices. For further information on 
Boliden’s metal price hedging, see Note 21 on page 71.
Treatment and refining charges
Treatment and refining charges are the primary components of the smelt-
ers’ income. Treatment and refining charge terms are determined largely 
by the balance between supply and demand in the metal concentrates 
market. Boliden buys in substantial volumes of metal concentrate for its 
copper smelters from external suppliers, and is consequently exposed to 
fluctuations in this market.
The terms for treatment and refining charges of metal concen-
trates are negotiated annually by the major players in the mining 
and smelting industries and the results of these negotiations serve 
as benchmarks for other players. In addition, concentrate transac-
tions are conducted at spot market charges. The copper concentrate 
from Boliden’s mines covers approximately 20 per cent of the cop-
per smelters’ capacity, while approximately 70 per cent of Boliden’s 
zinc smelter production capacity is covered by concentrate from the 
Group’s own mines. Changes to copper treatment and refining 
charges consequently have a significant impact on the Group’s prof-
36
boliden Annual Report 2009
its under normal circumstances, while changes to zinc treatment 
charges have a more limited impact.
Revaluation of process inventory
The process inventory is that part of the inventory that is fixed within the 
smelters’ production process. The prices of the process inventory – 
approximately 17,000 tonnes of zinc, 32,000 tonnes of copper, 2,300 kilos 
of gold, 74,000 kilos of silver and 1,000 tonnes of lead – is not price or 
currency hedged, and changes in the Lme prices for these metals conse-
quently have either a positive or a negative effect on the Group’s profits 
in conjunction with end of year stock revaluations. In order to clarify this 
accounting impact on the Group’s profits, Boliden reports its operating 
profit on a rolling basis both before and after revaluation of the stock 
inventory.
Customers
Base metals may be sold to industrial clients and base metal dealers or 
delivered to the metal stocks held by Lme and other international market-
places. Long-term agreements with industrial customers increase the pre-
dictability of the terms of sale and the stability of the sales. Boliden 
receives metal premiums over and above the Lme price in conjunction 
with direct sales to industrial customers and, to some extent, sales to metal 
dealers.
Boliden focuses on long-term partnerships with financially stable cus-
tomers in order to increase the stability of sales of the Group’s metals. 
Boliden also endeavours to intensify its relationships with customers, for 
example by ensuring a high standard of delivery reliability, by providing 
technical support, and by customising products in ways which increase 
the efficiency of the customers’ processes and improve the products’ ulti-
mate characteristics. These activities, together with long-term sales agree-
ments, help increase the percentage of sales with high metal premiums. 
Boliden endeavours to expand its customer portfolio in order to reduce 
the exposure that results from a small number of customers, segments 
and countries, through targeted sales activities.
Raw materials supply
Securing a long-term supply of raw materials is important in ensuring 
that Boliden’s smelters can produce at a high level of capacity utilisation 
and achieve consistent quality. There is always a risk that suppliers of raw 
materials to the Group’s smelters may suffer unplanned operational dis-
ruptions. Approximately 20 per cent of the copper smelters’ raw materi-
als requirements are covered by metal concentrates from mines within 
the Group. Approximately 70 per cent of the zinc smelters’ requirements 
can be supplied from within the Group. Boliden endeavours to conclude 
long-term agreements with external suppliers of metal concentrates and 
recycling materials for the copper smelters, with a view to maintaining  
a comprehensive and consistent supply.
Energy prices 
Mining operations, smelting and recycling operations, and, in particu-
lar, zinc smelters, are all energy-intensive activities. Energy accounted for 
approximately 18 per cent (17%) of Boliden’s operating costs in 2009, and 
changes in energy costs can hence have a significant effect on the Group’s 
profitability. Predicting Europe’s energy markets and energy price trends 
in both the short- and long-term is difficult.
Boliden endeavours to conclude long-term energy supply contracts 
in all of the countries in which it operates. The majority of the Group’s 
energy requirements over the next 5–10 years are covered by long-term
supply contracts, thereby stabilising energy supplies and limiting sensi-
tivity to short-term changes in energy prices. The long-term agreements 
are complemented on a rolling basis with financial electricity price hedg-
ing with terms of up to three years.
Boliden is working to ensure a long-term stable and competitive access 
to energy throughout the Nordic region through BasEl AB, a company 
jointly owned by a number of basic industry companies. Efforts in the 
longer term are aimed at meeting some of Boliden’s energy requirements 
through its own energy production by means of industrial partnerships 
such as Fennovoima and Industrikraft nuclear power projects in Finland 
and Sweden, respectively.
Boliden also works with measures designed to improve energy effi-
ciency in order to limit the Group’s energy requirement. In Sweden, Fin-
land and Ireland, Boliden participates in national efficiency-enhancing 
projects designed to boost industrial companies’ incentives to make 
energy savings. The Group also has an energy policy and all of the pro-
duction units have implemented energy management systems. Compli-
ance with the policy is monitored through internal audits.
Electricity prices are expected to rise when the Eu’s new legislation on 
the allocation of emissions rights for carbon dioxide come into force in 
2013. Boliden has formed an Eu Emission Trading System (Ets) project 
group, comprising both internal and external experts, in order to prepare 
for the impending legislation.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Unplanned production disruptions
Boliden’s production essentially comprises continuous processes where 
unplanned stoppages can impact both production and the financial 
result. These stoppages can, in some cases, be long term and identifying 
alternative solutions is often difficult. Unplanned stoppages can, for 
example, occur as a result of strikes, technical problems, or accidents. 
Boliden carries out preventative maintenance work at all of its pro-
duction units. Business Area Smelters carries out major maintenance 
shutdowns every year, while Business Area Mines’ maintenance work is 
integrated into the day-to-day operations. Smelters and Mines have been 
working with internal benchmarking projects and knowledge exchanges 
between the production units for a number of years now.
Environmental impact
Boliden, like other mining and smelting companies, manages natural 
geological resources and substantial physical materials flows as part of its 
operations. These activities have an impact on the external environment, 
primarily in the form of emissions and discharges of pollutants – mainly 
metals – to the air, soil and water. The mines’ operations also affect the 
surrounding landscape. Strict environmental requirements and extensive 
environmental legislation apply in all of the countries in which  Boliden 
operates. All of the Group’s mines and smelters require permits in order 
to operate and are regulated by the respective countries’ legislation.
In order to reduce its environmental impact, ensure compliance with 
existing regulations and facilitate adaptation to any new requirements, 
Boliden works with its own environmental goals and guidelines and with 
environmental management systems. All operating units have Iso 
14001-certified environmental management systems.
Work environment
All mining and smelting operations require high safety standards. Seri-
ous accidents may not only result in personal injury or death, but lead to 
production stoppages and damage public confidence in the company.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT/ RISKS
In addition to its investments in machinery and equipment, Boliden also 
provides training with a view to changing attitudes, routines and behav-
iour in order to strengthen further the corporate culture with regard to 
safety at work. There were a total of 5.5 accidents per one million hours 
worked in 2009, in comparison with 9.1 per one million hours worked 
in 2008.
Skill requirements
Boliden’s operations require numerous different types of expertise, includ-
ing metallurgical process and production technology, geotechnology and 
geology. The Group’s operations are largely conducted in sparsely popu-
lated areas, making it particularly important that we enhance our attrac-
tiveness as an employer and exercise good forward planning in terms of 
skill supply.
Approximately 30 per cent of Boliden’s employees will retire over the 
next five years. Boliden is working to map strategic competences and uses 
skill pool analyses in order to handle impending retirements and meet 
long-term recruitment needs.
FINANCIAL RISKS
For further information on financial risks, see Note 19 on pages 67–68.
Refinancing and liquidity risk
Boliden is exposed to both refinancing risk and liquidity risk. Rapid 
changes in the global economic climate demand good forward planning 
to ensure that the Group does not end up in a situation whereby it is dif-
ficult to extend or renegotiate existing loans. The term, liquidity risk, also 
refers to the risk of being unable to meet payment obligations due to 
insufficient liquidity.
The refinancing risk is limited by a good spread of counterparties and 
loan liability terms. Active efforts to generate satisfactory liquidity reserves 
through unutilised credit facilities limit Boliden’s liquidity risk.
Currency risk
Boliden’s revenues are primarily denominated in Us dollars, while its costs 
are primarily denominated in Swedish kronor, euro and Norwegian kro-
ner. Fluctuations in these currencies’ exchange rates consequently have 
a substantial impact on the Group’s income and results. Boliden’s policy 
is normally not to currency hedge the Group’s income, but deviations 
from this policy may be made under special circumstances in order to 
limit risks. The Group’s copper income was, for example, hedged in Us 
dollars in order to reduce the risk in conjunction with the expansion of 
the Aitik copper mine (see also the section headed “Metal prices” above). 
More information is available in Note 21 on pages 70–71.
Credit and counterparty risk
Credit and counterparty risk refers to the risk of the counterparty to a 
transaction being unable to fulfil their undertaking and of Boliden 
thereby incurring a loss.
Boliden’s counterparty and credit risks arise primarily in connection 
with trading in derivatives. In order to limit the risk exposure and in 
accordance with Boliden’s financial policy, the Group only accepts coun-
terparties with a high degree of creditworthiness and, as far as possible, 
limits the engagement with every counterparty.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT/THE BOLIDEN SHARE
THE BOLIDEN SHARE
The Boliden share is listed on the Nasdaq omx Stockholm Exchange in 
the Large Cap segment. The share also has a secondary listing on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange. In addition to Nasdaq omx’s index, the share 
is included in several international indices.
TRADING
Trading in the Boliden share continued to increase in 2009. A total of 
1,663 million (1,562 m) Boliden shares were traded during the year with 
a combined value of Sek 90 billion (Sek 70 b). 89.3 per cent of this trad-
ing occurred on the Nasdaq omx Stockholm Exchange, where the Boli-
den share accounted for 2.6 per cent (1.5%) of the total share turn  over. 
The turnover rate in the Boliden share was 535 per cent (530%) and an 
average of 6.6 million (6.2 m) shares were traded per trading day on the 
Nasdaq omx Stockholm Exchange.
Trading in so-called alternative marketplaces, Multilateral Trading 
Facilities (MTF), accounted for 10.7 per cent of the total number of 
 Boliden shares traded. The majority of this trading occurred on Chi-X. 
190,000 (284,000) shares were traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange 
in 2009, corresponding to 0.01 per cent of the total number of Boliden 
shares traded in 2009.
At the end of 2009, the Boliden share was quoted at Sek 92.10 on the 
Nasdaq omx Stockholm Exchange, corresponding to a market capital-
isation of Sek 25.2 billion (Sek 4.9 b).
In common with other raw material companies, the variation in the 
value of the Boliden share is, on average, greater than for the broad stock 
market index. The so-called beta value of the Boliden share over the last 
five years, based on the share price trend and the Omx Stockholm Pi index 
trend, is 1.98.
DIVIDEND AND RETURN
The price of the Boliden share rose by 417 per cent during the year, in 
comparison with the Omx Stockholm Pi and Omx Nordic Pi indices, 
which rose by 47 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively, in 2009. The Omx 
Nordic Materials sector index, which is quoted in Eur, and which 
includes the Boliden share, rose by 41 per cent. Boliden’s share price was 
positively affected by the effect of rising metal prices – primarily those 
for zinc and copper – on income and profit performance.
The Board of Directors has resolved to propose to the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting of the shareholders in the company that an ordinary divi-
dend of Sek 3 (Sek 1) per share be paid for 2009. The proposed dividend
THE BOLIDEN SHARE’S PRICE TREND
sek 
200
corresponds to 32.8 per cent (29.3%) of the net earnings per share and a 
dividend yield of 3.3 per cent (5.6%), calculated on the basis of the Boli-
den share price at the end of 2009.
The Boliden share’s total return (the sum of the proposed dividend 
and the price trend) in 2009 was 423 per cent. The average total return of 
the Boliden share over the past five-year period has been 121 per cent. The 
corresponding return for all companies on the Nasdaq omx Stockholm 
Exchange during the same period was 58 per cent. A table of share-related 
key ratios over a five-year period is shown on page 98.
SHARE CAPITAL
There are a total of 273,511,169 shares. Every share has a nominal value of 
Sek 2.12 and the share capital totals Sek 578,914,338.
Boliden’s share capital comprises a class of share in which every share 
has the same voting power and grants the same entitlement to dividends. 
There are no limitations with regard to the number of votes that a share-
holder can exercise at General Meetings of the company’s shareholders. 
The Boliden Articles of Association contain no provision restricting the 
right to transfer shares. Boliden has neither transferred any of its own shares 
nor issued any shares in 2009. Boliden is unaware of any agreement 
between shareholders that may entail restrictions on the right to transfer 
shares in the company. Boliden is not party to any significant agreement 
affected by any public buy out offer. Boliden has no shareholders who, 
either directly or indirectly, represent at least one tenth of the total number 
of votes for all shares. Boliden’s employees hold shares via profiting shar-
ing foundations for which voting rights cannot be directly exercised.
OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
Boliden had 96,155 (102,450) registered shareholders on 31st December 
2009. Approximately 40 per cent of the shares were owned by Swedish insti-
tutions and equity funds, approximately 40 per cent by foreign owners, and 
approximately 20 per cent by Swedish private persons. The five biggest sin-
gle shareholders represent 13 per cent of the share capital. The table on page 
40 shows Boliden’s ownership structure on 31st December 2009.

Refers to shareholders’ equity injected by the owners. When shares are 
issued at a premium, an amount corresponding to the amount received 
in excess of the nominal value of the shares shall be transferred to the 
share premium reserve.
Translation reserve
The current method is used to convert the Income Statements and 
Balance Sheets of overseas subsidiaries. Any exchange rate differences 
that apply are reported directly under other comprehensive income. 
Boliden currency hedges net investments in overseas subsidiaries by 
adopting the opposite position in the relevant foreign currency. The 
exchange rate difference on hedging instruments is, after the fiscal effect, 
reported under other comprehensive income.
Hedging reserve
Boliden applies hedge accounting for financial derivatives acquired with  
a view to hedging part of forecast currency, metal and interest flows. 
Changes in the market value of hedging instruments are reported under 
other comprehensive income until such time as the underlying flows are 
reported in the Income Statement.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
General Accounting Principles
Boliden AB (publ), Swedish corporate ID no. 556051-4142, is a limited 
liability company registered in Sweden. The company’s registered office 
is in Stockholm at the address: Klarabergsviadukten 90, SE-101 20 
Stockholm. The Boliden share is listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm’s 
Large Cap list. Boliden’s shares are also traded on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange in Canada, where they have a secondary listing.
The Company is the Boliden Group’s Parent Company, whose principal 
operations involve the mining and production of metals and operations 
compatible therewith.
The Consolidated Statements have been compiled in accordance with 
EU-approved International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the 
interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) extant on 1st January 2009. In addition, the Group 
applies the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recommendation RFR 
1.2, Supplementary accounting regulations for corporate conglomerates 
specifying the supplements to IFRS required pursuant to the stipulations 
of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act.
The accounting principles applied correspond to those applied in previ-
ous years, with the exceptions shown below:
The Group has introduced the following new and amended IASB  
standards and IFRIC pronouncements, as of 1st January 2009
–  IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: (Disclosures. Amendment). This standard 
means that additional disclosures are required with regard to financial 
instruments reported at fair value in the Balance Sheet. The disclosures 
shall describe the extent to which fair value is based on observable input 
data in accordance with a hierarchy of levels 1-3. Disclosure shall also 
be made with regard to internal changes between the hierarchy levels 
for financial instruments reported at fair value. The amendment to IFRS 
7 has entailed the presentation of additional information relating to 
financial instruments and expanded comments on liquidity planning.
–  IFRS 8, Operating Segments. This standard includes disclosure require-
ments with regard to the Group’s operating segments and replaces the 
requirement to define and present primary and secondary segments 
based on operating branches and geographic areas in accordance with 
the previously applicable recommendation, IAS 14. The new standard 
requires, instead, that segment information is presented from the 
management’s perspective, which means that it is presented in the way 
used in internal reporting. A certain amount of geographic information 
shall also be provided as well as the incidence of customers who account 
for more than 10 per cent of the Group’s net sales. The implementation 
of IFRS 8 has not given rise to any segments other than those reported 
as primary ones in accordance with IAS 14.
–  Revised IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements. The standard 
means that only transactions with owners are reported in the sharehold-
ers’ equity accounts. Other transactions previously reported in the 
shareholders’ equity accounts are reported as other comprehensive 
income within the report presenting the comprehensive income for the 
period. The revised standard also means that a third Balance Sheet 
relating to the beginning of the comparison year shall be presented when 
accounting principles change and the change entails a recalculation of 
previous periods. Boliden has elected to present separate income state-
ments and comprehensive income reports.
–  Revised IAS 23, Borrowing costs. The standard means that the ability 
to immediately book borrowing costs directly attributable to the pur-
chase, construction or production of a qualifying asset as costs is 
eliminated. The company is obliged to capitalise the cost as part of the 
acquisition value. The Group has historically used this principle in con-
junction with major investments.
The implementation of these standards and interpretations has had no 
effect on the Group’s financial results or position. They have, however, 
given rise to amendments to the presentation of the financial reports and 
to the inclusion of additional information in the Notes to the Accounts.
52
boliden annual report 2009
Other amendments to standards and interpretations that came into force 
in 2009 have had no effect on Boliden’s accounting.
The new standards and interpretations that will be applied to the 2010 
calendar year and subsequent years are presented below
–  IFRS 3R Business Combinations, and IAS 27R Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements. The changes to IFRS 3R and IAS 27R will affect 
the accounting of future acquisitions and disposals and transactions 
with minority owners.
– IFRS 9, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
This standard is an initial step in the complete revision of the existing 
standard, IAS 39. IFRS 9 must be applied to financial years commencing 
1st January 2013, or thereafter.
The Group has not evaluated the effects of the new standard, pending
the completion of all parts of the standard.
Other amendments to standards and interpretations that come into 
force on 1st January 2010 are not expected to have any effect on Boliden’s 
accounting.
The Parent Company’s functional currency is the Swedish krona (SEK) 
and this is also the reporting currency for both the Group and the Parent 
Company. All amounts in the financial reports are stated in millions of 
Swedish kronor (SEK million) unless otherwise specified.
In the Annual Report, the items reported have been valued at their 
acquisition value except when valuing certain financial assets that can be 
sold and financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
valued at their fair value.
The Parent Company’s accounting principles follow those of the Group, 
with the exception of the mandatory regulations stipulated in the Swedish 
Financial Reporting Board’s recommendation, RFR 2.2, Accounting for 
legal entities. The Parent Company’s accounting principles are specified 
under the heading, ”The Parent Company’s accounting principles”.
The most important accounting principles that have been applied are 
described below. These principles have been applied consistently for all 
years presented, unless otherwise specified.
Estimates and assessments
In order to compile Financial Statements in accordance with the IFRS 
accounting principles, assessments and assumptions must be made that 
impact the reported asset and liability amounts, the income and expense 
amounts, as well as other information provided in the Financial Statements. 
The estimates and assessments of the Board of Directors and the com-
pany’s management are based on historical experience and forecast 
future trends. The actual outcome may differ from these assessments.
Pension undertakings
Pension provisions and similar undertakings are dependent on the assump-
tions made in conjunction with calculations of the amounts. The assump-
tions refer to discount interest rates, future returns on assets held for 
investment purposes, rate of salary increases, future increases in pen-
sions, the number of remaining working years for employees, mortality 
rates and other factors. The assumptions are made for every country in 
which Boliden has defined benefit pension plans. The most critical factors 
are the discount rate on undertakings and the anticipated return on assets 
held for investment purposes. Boliden’s undertakings are shown in Note 
17. Boliden reviews the actuarial assumptions annually and amends them 
when necessary.
Legal disputes
Boliden regularly reviews outstanding legal disputes using internal com-
pany legal counsel and, when necessary, with the help of external advisors, 
in order to assess the need for provision to be made.
Reclamation costs
Provisions for reclamation are made on the basis of an assessment of 
future costs based on current conditions. Provisions are reviewed regularly
by internal or external specialists and updates made when necessary, when 
the estimated lifespans of mine assets, costs, technical preconditions, 
regulations or other conditions change. See Note 18 – Other provisions.
Valuation of tangible assets
Impairment tests of tangible and intangible assets are based on the 
company’s internal business plan and on assumptions with regard to future 
trends in metal prices and exchange rates, etc. Changes in market prices 
of metals and currencies have a substantial effect on the company’s future 
cash flows and hence on the estimated write-down requirement. 
Assumptions with regard to price trends for metals and currencies are 
made by the company management with the help of external experts. The 
assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted when neces-
sary. For further information, see Note 8 – Tangible fixed assets.
The depreciation periods for deferred mining costs, installations and 
equipment in mines depend on future ore extraction and the lifespan of 
the mine. The assessment of these aspects is, in turn, heavily dependent 
on ore reserves and consequently on future metal prices. Changes to 
conditions may entail changes to the rate of depreciation applied. Mines 
draw up annual production plans for the mine’s lifespan.
Consolidated statements
The Consolidated Statements cover the Parent Company and all compa-
nies over which the Parent Company through ownership, directly or indi-
rectly, exercises a controlling influence. The term “controlling influence” 
refers to companies in which Boliden has the right to formulate financial 
and operative strategies. This is generally achieved by ensuring that its 
ownership share, and share of the votes, exceeds 50 per cent. The exist-
ence and effect of potential voting rights that can currently be utilised or 
converted are taken into account when assessing whether the Group is 
capable of exercising a controlling influence over another company.
Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Statements as of the point 
in time at which a controlling influence was attained, while companies that 
have been sold are included in the Consolidated Statements up to and 
including the time of the sale, which is considered to be as of the point in 
time when the controlling influence ceased to be exercised.
The Consolidated Statements have been compiled in accordance with 
the acquisition accounting method, which means that the acquisition value 
of a company comprises the fair value of the payment made (including the 
fair value of any assets, liabilities and own equity instruments issued) plus 
costs directly associated with the acquisition of the operations. The iden-
tifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired which meet the 
criteria for reporting in accordance with IFRS 3 are reported at their fair 
value on the acquisition date. When required, the subsidiaries’ accounts 
are adjusted to ensure that they follow the same principles applied by 
other Group companies. All internal transactions between Group compa-
nies and intra-Group affairs are eliminated when the Consolidated 
Statements are compiled.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated except for transactions where
there is a clear need for a write-down.
Associated companies
Shareholdings in associated companies, in which the Group has a mini-
mum of 20 per cent and a maximum of 50 per cent of the votes, or oth-
erwise has a significant influence over operational and financial manage-
ment, are reported in accordance with the equity method. Under the 
equity method, the consolidated book value of the shares in the associated 
companies corresponds to the Group’s share of the associated companies’ 
shareholders’ equity and any residual values from consolidated surplus 
values. Shares in associated companies’ results are reported in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as part of the operating profit and com-
prise the Group’s share in the associated companies’ net results. Shares 
in profits accumulated after the acquisition of associated companies but 
not yet realised through dividends constitute part of the Group’s equity.
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Under the current method, all assets, provisions and liabilities are con-
verted at the rate of exchange applying on the closing day, while all items 
in the Income Statement are converted at the average exchange rate. Any 
exchange rate differences that arise are booked directly to other compre-
hensive income. Accumulated translation differences arising in connection 
with the conversion of subsidiaries’ results are reported as of 2004.
Boliden hedges its net investments in foreign subsidiaries by adopting 
an opposite position in the relevant foreign currency. Any exchange rate 
differences on hedging measures are reported as part of the other com-
prehensive income.
In conjunction with the sale of overseas operations whose functional 
currency is different from the Group’s reporting currency, the accumulated 
translation differences attributable to the operations are realised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, after deductions for any currency hedg-
ing activities.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised and measured within the Group in 
accordance with IAS 39.
Financial assets or liabilities are booked in the Balance Sheet when the 
company officially becomes a party to the instrument’s contractual terms 
and conditions. Financial assets are removed from the Balance Sheet 
when the rights in the agreement either mature or are realised, or when 
the company loses control of them. Financial liabilities are removed from 
the Balance Sheet when the agreement’s obligations are fulfilled or oth-
erwise rendered void. Purchases and sales of derivatives are reported 
on the trading date.
Financial instruments are reported using the fair value, accumulated 
acquisition value or acquisition value depending on the initial categorisation 
under IAS 39. On each reporting occasion, the company performs an 
impairment test to determine whether objective indications exist of the 
need to write down a financial asset or group of financial assets.
Valuation principles
Fair value 
All derivatives are valued at fair value via the Income Statement or other 
comprehensive income when cash flow hedging is applied. The fair value 
of financial instruments is based on listed market prices and a discounting 
of estimated cash flows. Metal derivatives are traded on the London Metal 
Exchange (LME) and on the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) 
exchange while electricity derivatives are traded on Nordpool. When 
calculating discounted cash flows, all calculation variables, such as dis-
count rates and exchange rates, have been based on quoted market 
prices. Discount rates are based on current market rates per currency 
and time to maturity for the financial instrument. The Garman-Kohlhagen 
formula has been applied to the valuation of currency options. Items in 
foreign currencies are converted into Swedish kronor using the official 
exchange rate on the Balance Sheet date.
Accumulated acquisition value
Cash and bank balances, loan receivables and accounts receivable are 
valued at the accrued acquisition value. Financial liabilities are initially valued 
in the amount of funds received, less any transaction costs, but are valued 
on an ongoing basis at the accrued acquisition value. Accrued acquisition 
values are calculated using the effective interest rate method. This means 
that any premiums or discounts, as well as expenses or income directly 
attributable to them, are distributed over the duration of the contract with 
the aid of the estimated effective interest rate. The effective interest rate 
is the interest rate that yields the instrument’s acquisition value as a result 
in conjunction with current value calculation of future cash flows.
Acquisition value
Shares and participations available for sale are valued at the acquisition 
value as the fair value cannot be calculated in a satisfactory manner.
Conversion of foreign subsidiaries and other overseas operations
The currency in the primary economic environment in which the company 
conducts operations is the functional currency. The current method is 
applied to cover the conversion of the Income Statements and Balance 
Sheets of independent overseas operations to the functional currency.
Classification
Structural exposure
For financial derivatives relating to the hedging of forecast flows, cash 
flow hedging, hedge accounting is applied, which means that the effective 
share of unrealised changes in value (market values) is reported under
boliden annual report 2009
53
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
other comprehensive income up to the point in time when the hedged 
item, such as forecast metal sales, dollar income, interest expenses and 
electricity costs, is realised and thus reported in the Income Statement. 
Realised results attributable to metal and currency derivatives are reported 
under net sales, while the result of electricity derivatives is reported under 
operating profit, and the result of interest derivatives under net financial 
items. The ineffective part of cash flow hedging is reported under net 
financial items. The change in the time value of options is reported under 
the operating profit or net financial items, depending on the intention of 
the hedging.
Transaction exposure
The result of the revaluation of fair value hedging that qualifies for hedge 
accounting is reported under the operating profit at fair value, together 
with changes in the fair value of the asset or liability to which the hedging 
refers. Changes in the value of outstanding derivatives, where hedge 
accounting is not applied or which do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting, are reported on a rolling basis under the operating profit or 
net financial items, depending on whether the hedging is in respect of an 
operational risk or a financial risk.
Translation exposure
Changes in the value of hedging in respect of net investments in overseas 
operations are reported under other comprehensive income. Any ineffec-
tive component of these hedges is reported under net financial items.
Fair value hierarchy
Boliden has, in accordance with IFRS 7, classified the financial instruments 
on the basis of a three-level fair value hierarchy. The assessment has been 
conducted on the basis of circumstances and factors obtaining with regard 
to the various instruments, such as whether the instrument is traded on 
an active market and the observable data used in the valuations.
Metal futures and electricity futures are classified as level two, in that 
the discounted prices are based on the listed daily prices from stock markets. 
Currency futures and interest swaps have also been classified as level two, 
in that observable market data is available. Options have also been classified 
as level two, with reference to the fact that significant data for the valuation 
is based on observable market data and the fact that the options held have 
short durations. Discount rates used are based on current market rates 
per currency and time to maturity for the financial instrument.
Offsetting financial assets against financial liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are used to offset each other and are 
reported in a net amount in the Balance Sheet whenever a legal right of 
offset exists, and when the intention is to settle the items using a net 
amount, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Receivables
Receivables are reported according to their expected recoverability, that is 
to say after deductions for bad debts assessed on an individual basis. The 
anticipated duration of accounts receivable and other current receivables is 
short, which is why the value is reported as the nominal amount with no 
discounting in accordance with the accumulated acquisition value method.
Receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies
Receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies are converted at the 
exchange rate applying on the closing day. Exchange rate differences on 
operating receivables and operating liabilities are included in the operating 
profit, while exchange rate differences on financial receivables and liabili-
ties are reported under financial items.
Interest-bearing current receivables
Holdings of securities or other investments that are not fixed assets and 
are not designated as liquid assets are reported as interest-bearing cur-
rent receivables. Interest-bearing current receivables are categorised as 
“Commercial holdings” and are valued at their fair value with value changes 
as reported in the Income Statement.
Liquid assets
Short-term investments with a duration of three months or less that can
54
boliden annual report 2009
easily be converted into cash are classified as liquid assets, as are cash 
and bank balances. Liquid assets are exposed to no more than a negligible 
risk of fluctuation in value and are reported using the nominal amount.
Liabilities
Financial liabilities primarily comprise liabilities to credit institutions and 
accounts receivable. These liabilities are categorised as other liabilities 
and reported using their accumulated acquisition value. The anticipated 
duration of accounts payable is short, which is why the value is reported 
as the nominal amount with no discounting in accordance with the accu-
mulated acquisition value method. Interest expenses are distributed over 
a fixed period and are reported on an ongoing basis in the Income 
Statement with the exception of that part included in the acquisition value 
for tangible fixed assets.
Revenue recognition
Sales of metal concentrates, metals and by-products are reported at the 
time of delivery to the customer in accordance with the terms and condi-
tions of the sale, that is to say revenue is recognized whenever significant 
rights and obligations associated with the title transfer to the purchaser. 
These sales are reported net after VAT, discounts and exchange rate 
differences when sales are made in foreign currencies.
Preliminary invoices are issued for the Group’s metal concentrates at 
the time of delivery. Definitive invoices are issued when all component 
parameters (concentrate quantity , metal content, impurity content, and 
the metal price for the agreed pricing period – normally the average price 
on the LME in the month after delivery) have been established.
The Group’s metals are invoiced to the customers at the time of deliv-
ery. The Group eliminates the price risk in conjunction with the sale and 
purchase of metals by hedging the imbalance between quantities pur-
chased and sold on a daily basis. The smelters’ income comprises TC/
RC, free metals, compensation for impurities in the raw materials, and 
the worth of by-products.
Income from activities outside the sphere of the regular operations is
reported as other operating income.
Exploration, research and development
Boliden’s R&D primarily comprises exploration, that is searching for new 
deposits of base metals. Boliden is also involved, to a limited extent, in 
developing mining and smelting processes. Expenses associated with 
research and development are primarily booked as costs when they arise. 
When the financial potential for the exploitation of a mine deposit has been 
confirmed, the expenses are booked as costs up to that date. After that 
date, the expenses are capitalised as deferred mining costs, the govern-
ing principle of which is described under the heading “Tangible fixed 
assets”.
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets include patents, licenses and similar rights and are 
booked at their acquisition value as well as goodwill. Goodwill comprises the 
amount by which the acquisition value exceeds the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the acquired subsidiary’s identifiable net assets as well as any 
contingent liabilities at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill is reported in 
the Balance Sheet at the value in conjunction with the acquisition, converted, 
where relevant, at the closing day rate, after deduction for accumulated 
write-downs. Calculations of the profit or loss on the sale of a unit include 
any remaining reported goodwill value ascribed to the operations sold.
Goodwill has been assessed as having an indefinable useful life. Goodwill 
is allocated to the smallest possible unit or groups of units that generate 
cash where separate cash flows can be identified, and an impairment test 
is performed on the reported value at least once a year to determine 
whether there is any need of a write-down. Such impairment tests are 
however performed more frequently if there are indications that the value 
may have fallen during the year.
Other intangible fixed assets are amortised over their anticipated use-
ful lives.
Tangible fixed assets
Land, plants and equipment, and capitalised costs associated therewith 
for development and pre-production measures are booked at the acquisi-
tion value. Interest expenses attributable to development financing and 
completion of significant tangible fixed assets are included in the acquisi-
tion value. Repair and maintenance expenses are booked as costs, while 
substantial improvements and replacements are capitalised. Deferred 
mining costs at mines comprise both the waste rock excavation required 
to access the ore body, plus work relating to infrastructural facilities, 
roads, tunnels, shafts and inclined drifts, as well as service, electricity 
and air distribution facilities. Deferred mining costs arising from capacity 
expansion of the mining operation, the development of new ore bodies 
and the preparation of mining areas for future ore production are capital-
ised and written off concurrently with the ore production. Mining costs 
associated with waste rock removal from open pit sites are capitalised 
and booked as costs in the operations based on the average percentage 
of waste rock per mine. The average percentage of waste rock is calcu-
lated as the estimated number of tonnes of waste rock and ore that must 
be mined divided by the estimated number of tonnes of ore that the deposit 
is believed to contain. When the percentage of waste rock for the mines 
remains relatively constant over the useful life of the mines, the costs are 
normally reported when they arise.
Depreciation and write-down principles for tangible fixed assets
Depreciation according to plan is based on the original acquisition value 
and the estimated economic lifespan. The company normally depreciates 
plants and equipment used in the mining operations linearly over whichever 
is the lower of their anticipated useful life and the useful life of the mine to 
which they relate. Smelters and production plants are depreciated linearly 
over their anticipated useful lives. The following depreciation periods are 
applied to tangible fixed assets:
Buildings  
Land improvements  
Deferred mining costs 
Machinery and other technical facilities
  Machinery  
  Processing plants  
Equipment, tools, fixtures and fittings
20–50 years
20 years
Concurrently with ore depletion
3–10 years
10–25 years
3–10 years
Boliden applies component depreciation, which means that larger process-
ing facilities are broken down into component parts with different useful 
lives and thus different depreciation periods.
When events or changes in prevailing conditions indicate that the book 
value of fixed assets exceeds the recovery value, this value is written down 
to this lower recovery value.
Write-downs
On each reporting occasion, an assessment is performed to determine 
whether there is any indication that the value of the Group’s assets has 
depreciated or been impaired. Should this be the case, a calculation is 
performed of the recovery value of the asset in question. Goodwill is 
allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units and 
is, together with any intangible assets with an indefinable useful life, sub-
jected to annual impairment tests even if there are no indications of a fall 
in its value. Impairment tests are however performed more frequently if 
indications exist of a decline in value. The recovery value comprises which-
ever is highest of the value in use of the asset in the operations and the 
value that would result if the asset were sold to an independent party, fair 
value minus selling expenses. The value in use comprises the present 
value of all incoming and outgoing payments attributable to the asset over 
the period that it is expected to be used in the operations, plus the present 
value of the net sales value at the end of the asset’s useful life. If the esti-
mated recovery value is lower than the reported value, the latter is written 
down to the former.
Write-downs are reported in the Income Statement. Any write-downs 
performed are reversed if changes in the assumptions leading to the 
original write-down mean that the write-down is no longer warranted. 
Write-downs that have been performed are not reversed in such a way that 
the reported value exceeds the amount that would, following deductions 
for amortisation according to plan, have been reported if no write-down 
had been performed. Reversals of write-downs performed are reported in 
the Income Statement. Goodwill write-downs are not reversed.
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Leasing
A financial leasing agreement is an agreement whereby the financial risks 
and benefits associated with a title are, in all significant respects, trans-
ferred from the lessor to the lessee. Leasing agreements that are not 
classified as financial leasing agreements are classified as operational 
leasing agreements.
Assets held in accordance with financial leasing agreements are 
reported initially as fixed assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the 
lower of the market value of the assets or the present value of the future 
lease payments. The Group’s liability in relation to the lessor is reported 
in the Balance Sheet under the heading “Liabilities to credit institutions”, 
broken down into current and long-term components.
Lease payments are broken down into interest and amortisation of the 
liability. The interest is distributed over the leasing period so that an amount 
corresponding to the fixed interest amount payable on the liability reported 
in each period is charged to each reporting period. The leased asset is 
depreciated according to the same principles as those that apply to other 
assets of the same type.
The leasing charges for operational leasing agreements are booked
as costs on a linear basis over the leasing period.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at whichever is the lower of the acquisition value in 
accordance with the so-called first-in-first-out principle and the net sale 
value, taking into account the risk of obsolescence. The acquisition value 
of inventories of metals from the company’s mines and of semi-finished 
and finished products manufactured in-house comprises the direct man-
ufacturing costs plus a reasonable surcharge for indirect manufacturing 
costs. Supplies inventories are valued at whichever is the lower of the 
average acquisition value and the replacement value.
Taxes
The tax expense (income) for the period comprises current tax and 
deferred tax. Taxes are reported in the Income Statement and in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Current tax is the tax calculated on the taxable result for each period. 
The year’s taxable result differs from the year’s reported result before tax 
in that it has been adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items and 
temporary differences. The Group’s current tax liability is calculated in 
accordance with the taxation rates stipulated or announced on the Balance 
Sheet date.
Deferred tax is reported using the Balance Sheet method. This method 
stipulates that deferred tax liabilities are reported in the Balance Sheet 
for all taxable temporary differences between reported and fiscal values 
of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax receivables are reported in the 
Balance Sheet in respect of deficit deductions and all deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is likely that the amounts can be used to 
offset future taxable surpluses. The reported value of deferred tax receiv-
ables is checked at the end of each accounting period and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable surpluses will be 
available for its use. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the 
taxation rates that are expected to apply to the period in which the asset 
is recovered or the liability is settled.
Both deferred and current tax receivables and tax liabilities are offset 
when they relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority and when 
the Group intends to settle the tax in the form of a net amount.
Provisions
Provisions are reported when the Group has, or may be considered to 
have an obligation as a result of events that have occurred and it is likely 
that payments will be required in order to fulfil this obligation. In addition, 
one of the prerequisites is that it should be possible to make a reliable 
estimate of the amount to be paid.
Provisions are made for the estimated reclamation costs that are 
expected to arise when the operations are decommissioned and are 
reported as costs over the total estimated operating period. The cost is 
reported as part of the cost of goods sold. Provisions are broken down 
into short and long-term components.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a potential undertaking that derives from events 
which have occurred and whose incidence is only confirmed by one or 
more uncertain future events. A contingent liability can also be an existing 
undertaking that has not been reported in the Balance Sheet because it 
is unlikely that an outflow of resources will be required or because the size 
of the undertaking cannot be calculated. See Note 23 Pledged assets and 
contingent liabilities.
Employee benefits
Pension undertakings
The Group’s companies have a variety of pension systems in accordance 
with local conditions and practice in the countries in which they operate. 
They are generally financed through payments made to insurance com-
panies or through own provisions determined through periodic actuarial 
calculations. The Group’s provisions for pension undertakings are calcu-
lated in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits.
For pension systems where the employer is committed to premium-
based solutions, the undertaking in relation to the employee ceases when 
the agreed premiums have been paid. Premiums paid are booked as costs 
on an ongoing basis.
For other pension systems where a defined benefit pension has been 
contractually agreed, the undertaking does not cease until the agreed 
pensions have been paid out. Boliden commissions independent actuaries 
to calculate pension undertakings relating to the defined benefit pension 
plan arrangements in each country.
These calculations take account of future salary increases, the discount 
rate and the return on assets held for investment purposes, as well as 
other significant actuarial assumptions.
The pension cost for the year comprises the present value of pensions 
earned during the year, plus interest on the undertaking at the start of 
the year, less deductions for the return on each pension plan’s assets held 
for investment purposes. Amortisation of actuarial profits/losses and for 
changes to plans is added to this figure. Accumulated profits and/or 
losses totalling less than 10 per cent of whichever is the higher of the 
pension undertaking and the fair value of the assets held for investment 
purposes are not amortised. When the accumulated profit or loss exceeds 
this 10 per cent limit, the excess amount is amortised over the average 
remaining period of employment of each pension plan’s employees.
Remuneration may be payable in the event of notice being given if an 
employee is given notice prior to the end of the normal retirement date 
or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy. The Group reports 
a liability and a cost in connection with a notice being given when Boliden 
is obligated to give the employee in question notice prior to the normal 
point in time for employment cessation, or to provide remuneration with 
a view to encouraging early retirement.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as share capital. Transaction costs con-
nected with a new share issue are reported as a net amount after tax, 
for deduction from the issue proceeds received.
Buy-back of own shares
Boliden’s holdings of its own shares are reported as a reduction in share-
holders’ equity. Transaction costs are reported directly against sharehold-
ers’ equity.
Dividend
A dividend payment proposed by the Board of Directors does not reduce 
the shareholders’ equity until it has been approved by the Annual General 
Meeting. Anticipated dividends are reported in those cases when the 
Parent Company has the sole right to determine the size of the dividend 
and has ensured that the dividend does not exceed the subsidiary com-
pany’s dividend payment capacity.
Information per segment
Boliden has introduced an organisational structure divided into two 
Business Areas – Smelters and Mines – during the year. The change entails 
the integration of Business Area Market’s operations with those of these 
two areas.
56
boliden annual report 2009
The majority of the Business Area Market operations – the purchase of 
raw materials and sale of metals – has been integrated into Smelters, 
while responsibility for the sale of mined concentrates has been integrated 
into Mines. The changes have been made in order to enable additional 
improvements to be made in the efficiency of the Group’s material flows.
Segment Mines comprises the operations of the Swedish mines, Aitik, 
the Boliden Area and Garpenberg, and the Tara mine in Ireland. Aitik 
produces copper concentrate with some gold and silver content. The other 
Swedish mines produce zinc, copper and lead concentrates, with variable 
gold and silver content. Tara produces zinc and lead concentrates.
Business Area Smelters comprises the Kokkola and Odda zinc smelt-
ers, the Rönnskär and Harjavalta copper smelters, and the Bergsöe lead 
smelter. The Business Area is responsible for all sales of the smelters’ 
products and handles all raw material flows between the Group’s mines, 
smelters and customers. This includes responsibility for purchases of 
metal concentrates and recycling materials from external suppliers. The 
zinc smelters’ production primarily comprises zinc metal, but also includes 
aluminium fluoride, which is manufactured at Odda. The copper smelters’ 
production primarily comprises copper, gold, silver, lead and sulphuric 
acid. The copper smelters also recycle metal and electronic scrap and 
smelt nickel. The Bergsöe lead smelter recycles lead metal from scrap 
car batteries.
Transactions between the Business Areas, primarily involving metal
concentrates, are settled on market terms.
Group staff functions, Group-wide functions that are not assigned to 
Smelters or Mines, and the elimination of intra-Group sales, are reported 
in segment Other. The market valuation of financial derivatives used to 
manage currency and metal price risks are reported under Other until 
such  time  as  their  underlying  flows  are  reflected  in  the  Income 
Statement.
Note 25 on page 75 contains details of revenues per geographical 
market, showing the location of external customers and information on 
major customers. Assets and investments per geographical market are 
also reported there.
The Parent Company’s accounting principles
The Parent Company’s annual accounts are compiled in accordance with 
the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s 
recommendation, RFR 2.2, Accounting for legal entities, and the state-
ments issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. RFR 2.2 means 
that the Parent Company shall, in the annual accounts for the legal entity, 
apply all EU-approved International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
and statements to the extent that this is possible within the framework of 
the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and while taking into account the con-
nection between reporting and taxation. The recommendation specifies 
the exceptions and additions to be made in relation to IFRS. The differences 
between the Group’s and the Parent Company’s accounting principles are 
described below.
Reporting Group contributions
Boliden reports Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions in 
accordance with the statements issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting 
Board, UFR 2. Shareholders’ contributions are booked directly against 
non-restricted equity by the recipient and as an increase in the item 
“Participations in Group companies” by the contributor.
Group contributions provided and received for the purpose of minimiz-
ing the Group’s tax payments are reported as a decrease or increase in 
non-restricted equity, respectively. Their fiscal effect is also reported 
directly against shareholders’ equity and therefore has no impact on the 
result.
Group contributions received, and which equate to dividends, are
reported directly as income in the Income Statement.
Subsidiaries
Participations in subsidiary companies are reported in the Parent Company 
in accordance with the acquisition value method. Determination of the 
value of subsidiary companies is effected when there are indications of a 
Decline in value.

Profit sharing system
A new profit-sharing system was introduced for all employees of the Boliden 
Group in 2007. A profit share is payable when the return on capital 
employed reaches 10 per cent, and the maximum profit share (SEK 
25,000/full-time employee) is payable when the return on capital employed 
reaches 20 per cent. The annual maximum allocation must never, however, 
exceed one third of the dividend paid to shareholders. The funds cannot 
be disbursed to employees for 3 years. A maximum allocation was made 
in 2007, no allocation was made for 2008, and for 2009, the allocation 
has been based on a return on capital employed of 14 per cent. The profit 
sharing foundations invest in liquid interest-bearing assets and shares in 
Boliden.

Remunerations paid to the Board Members and senior executives
Principals
Fees as approved by the Annual General Meeting are payable to the 
Chairman of the Board and to members of the Board. Employee repre-
sentatives receive no directors’ fees.
Remuneration paid to the President and other senior executives comprises 
the basic salary, variable remuneration and other benefits, as well as pen-
sions. The term “senior executives” refers to the total of six people who, 
together with the President, have comprised the Group management during 
the year. All members of the Group management are employed in Sweden.
The breakdown between basic salary and variable remuneration shall 
be in proportion to the executive’s responsibilities and authority. The vari-
able remuneration is maximised to 50 per cent of the basic salary for the 
President, while for other senior executives, it is maximised to 30–40 per 
cent of the basic salary.
Boliden applies the total remuneration level principle, i.e. pension benefits 
and other benefits payable to the President and other senior executives are 
taken into account when determining fixed and variable remuneration.

The specification of key expense items relates to the following Income 
Statement items: “Costs of goods sold”, “Selling expenses”, “Administrative 
expenses” and “Research and development costs”.
Directors’ fees, as shown above, also include remuneration for work on 
the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee comprises Ulla Litzén (Chair), 
Anders Sundström and Anders Ullberg.
Variable remuneration
The variable remuneration paid to the President in 2009 was based on 
the Group’s return on shareholders’ equity and financial key ratios related 
to loan terms.
For other members of the Group management, 25–50 per cent of the 
variable remuneration for 2009 was based on the Group financial goals 
and 50–75 per cent on their personal sphere of responsibility and indi-
vidual goals. Other benefits refer primarily to company cars.
Pensions 
The President has a defined contribution pension plan to which the com-
pany allocates 35 per cent of the fixed monthly salary on a rolling basis. 
The President decides for himself the level of the survivor annuity, indem-
nity for medical treatment or disability, etc. component of his insurance 
solution. The President’s retirement age is 65.
Two of the other members of the Group management have a retirement 
age of 60, while the remainder will retire at 65. A defined benefit pension plan 
yielding approximately 70 per cent of the agreed fixed salary between the ages 
of 60 and 65 applies for those members with a retirement age of 60.
Severance pay
The President and the company shall give six and twelve months’ notice 
of the termination of the President’s position, respectively. If notice is 
given by the company, severance pay corresponding to twelve months’ 
salary is payable, over and above the notice period pay. Other income 
shall be offset against the severance pay. No severance pay is payable 
in the event of notice being given by the President.
Other members of the Group management have notice periods of 
between three and six months if they give notice themselves. If notice of 
termination is given by the company, the period of notice is between six 
and twelve months. In addition, severance pay corresponding to between 
six and eighteen months’ salary shall be payable. The combined remu-

Interest expenses have been positively affected by lower average interest 
rates. Boliden’s average interest rate on 31st December 2009 totalled  
2.62 per cent (5.18%). Deductions of SEK 117 million (SEK 74 m) have 
been made from interest payments on loans at the accrued acquisition 
value for interest capitalisation attributable to the Aitik expansion.

The company’s goodwill item arose primarily in conjunction with the acqui-
sition of the operations from Outokumpu at the end of December 2003. 
The goodwill from the 2003 acquisition has been allocated in its entirety 
to the Group’s Smelters segment.
Impairment tests have been carried out on the value of goodwill in the 
manner described in Note 8 under Impairment testing – Intangible and 
tangible fixed assets.

Impairment tests – Intangible and tangible fixed assets
The impairment tests are carried out yearly and are based on the Group’s 
annual budget and strategic planning work. The planning horizon is the 
estimated lifespan of each mine. The smelters and their associated good-
will have been assigned an indefinite useful life and the cash flow forecasts 
therefore include an indeterminate period of time. Any residual value of 
fixed assets at the end of a mine’s lifespan is not taken into account in the 
discounted cash flow.
The present value of estimated future cash flows is based on the budget 
and price forecasts adopted by the Board of Directors. Price forecasts 
for the first three years comprise the relevant futures prices on metals 
and currency markets. The long-term price forecasts used in year four 
and thereafter consist of an anticipated average price over a single busi-
ness cycle, generally 10 years. The long-term price forecasts are currently 
as listed in the table below.

Tax losses carried forward 
Deferred tax receivables in respect of tax losses carried forward in Sweden 
have been taken into account in full as the company is of the opinion that 
Boliden will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to 
exploit these tax losses carried forward. Unutilised tax losses carried 
forward for which a deferred tax receivable has not been reported totalled 
SEK 72 million (SEK 57 m) in Canada on 31st December 2009..

The Articles of Association for Boliden AB state that the share capital 
shall comprise a minimum of SEK 150,000,000 and a maximum of SEK 
600,000,000. The nominal value is SEK 2.12 per share. The share 
capital comprises a single class of share. The Annual General Meeting of 
the Company’s shareholders held on 29th April 2009 resolved to pay a 
dividend of SEK 1 (SEK 4) per share, equivalent to a total payment of SEK 
273,511,169. The Annual General Meeting held in 2008 resolved to 
reduce the share capital by SEK 31,892,000 by means of the cancellation 
of bought-back shares, and to increase the share capital by the corre-
sponding amount by means of a bonus issue, without the issue of 
shares.

Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the period by 
the average number of shares. No instruments exist that could give rise 
to a dilution effect, and the calculation is, therefore, the same for earnings 
per share before and after dilution.Boliden monitors its capital structure 
with the aid of the net debt/equity ratio, among other things. The net debt/
equity ratio is calculated as the net of interest-bearing provisions and lia-
bilities minus financial assets including liquid assets divided by shareholders’ 
equity.

NOTES
Note 17  Provisions for pensions and similar undertakings
Boliden has defined benefit pension plans in Sweden and Ireland that may 
or may not be placed in funds. Pension undertakings in Sweden are cov-
ered by the Swedish PRI/FPG system and by insurance companies. The 
majority of the pension undertakings for salaried employees in Sweden 
are administered via Alecta. Alecta is unable to supply sufficient informa-
tion for the ITP plan (supplementary pensions for salaried employees) to 
be reported as a defined benefit plan, and it is consequently reported in 
accordance with UFR 3 as a defined contribution plan. A surplus in Alecta 
can be allocated to the policyholders and/or those insured. At the end of 
the year, Alecta’s collective consolidation level was 136 per cent (112%). 
The collective consolidation level comprises the market value of Alecta’s 
assets as a percentage of the insurance undertakings calculated in accord-
ance with Alecta’s actuarial calculation assumptions, which do not cor-
respond with those of IAS 19. Pension arrangements outside Sweden are 
adapted to local conditions and are a function of the number of years 
worked and the final salary. They are generally coordinated with national 
pension schemes. Defined contribution pension plans have been estab-
lished in Sweden, Ireland, Finland and Norway.
Defined benefit pension plans have been replaced by defined contribu-
tion plans in Norway in 2008.
Agreements have been reached between the Employers’ Association 
of Swedish Mine Owners (GAF) and the IF Metall trade union in 2009 
whereby the current pension plan for underground workers in Sweden 
will be replaced by a pension plan for all company employees who are
members of IF Metall. The plan comes into force on 1st January in 2010 
and is a premium-based pension plan that replaces a defined benefit pen-
sion plan. The agreement for the new pension plan includes transitional 
rules whereby a one-off payment is calculated on the basis of age and the 
number of underground months worked. The one-off payment will be paid 
to the chosen pension solution on the retirement date, but no earlier than 
at the age of 60. Existing undertakings for underground workers will be 
replaced in 2010 by an undertaking to make a one-off payment in accord-
ance with the transitional rules laid down in the agreement.
Boliden’s pension undertakings in Ireland are primarily secured by the 
transfer of funds to four defined benefit plans and one defined contribution 
plan. The defined benefit plans include undertakings for all personnel, 
while the defined contribution plan is a complementary solution for person-
nel paid an hourly wage. Unrealised actuarial results in the defined ben-
efit plans are reported in accordance with IAS 19.
The main change from previous years is that the unreported actuarial 
losses attributable to Ireland have fallen, partly due to actuarial losses 
being carried as expenses in accordance with the corridor method, and 
partly due to the increase in the market value of plan assets.
Boliden expects to transfer approximately SEK 70 million to defined 
benefit plans in 2010. Costs, undertakings and other factors in pension 
plans are calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, using the 
assumptions shown in the table below.

Reclamation costs
Provisions for reclamation costs are made on the basis of an assessment 
of future costs based on current technology and other conditions. 
Provisions are made for the estimated reclamation costs and are booked 
as costs over the total estimated operating period. Gradual reclamation 
is preferable, although most of the reclamation work is done after a deci-
sion to decommission. In historical terms, Boliden has succeeded in 
extending the useful life of its mining assets compared with the original 
plans. Reclamation provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
For provisions for fines relating to the copper tubing cartel, please see
Note 23, page 73.
Note 19  Financial risk management
Boliden is exposed to a number of financial risks. Changes in metal prices, 
treatment and refining charges, exchange rates, interest levels and energy 
price risks affect the Group’s results and cash flows. The pricing terms 
for Boliden’s products are principally determined on financial markets 
such as the London Metal Exchange (LME), the London Bullion Market 
(LBMA), Nordpool, and the currency and money market.
Boliden is also exposed to refinancing and liquidity risks and to credit
and counterparty risks.
Boliden’s operating risks are described in the Directors’ Report under
the Risk Management heading on page 36.
Boliden has a centralised treasury function whose primary duties involve 
managing financial risks and supporting the management and operating 
units at Parent Company and Group level. This results in good internal risk 
control and in financial and administrative economies of scale. The treas-
ury function is responsible for identifying and efficiently limiting the Group’s 
financial risks in line with the financial policy adopted by the Board of 
Directors. This is done by means of, among other things, the quarterly 
and annual reporting by the Group companies of their future metal produc-
tion exposure, exchange rate and interest rate exposure, and electricity 
consumption. The Group’s total sensitivity to these factors is calculated 
on the basis of these exposures. The effects of different market scenarios 
can be quantified on the basis of sensitivity to market changes and act as 
source data for managing financial risks. An assessment of the hedged 
part of the Group’s total exposure to metal production, exchange rate and 
interest exposure, and its electricity consumption, is calculated on the 
basis of forecast exposure, and reported to the management, the Board 
and the market. The units also report liquidity and profit forecasts on an 
ongoing basis, thereby generating the preconditions for efficient control 
and liquidity management.
Exchange rate and metal price risks
Through its operations, Boliden is exposed to both exchange rate risks 
and metal price risks, in that changes in exchange rates and metal prices 
affect the Group’s profits and cash flow. The Group’s exchange rate and 
metal price exposure covers transaction exposure, structural exposure 
and translation exposure.
Transaction exposure
This exposure arises when Boliden undertakes to participate in a transac-
tion at a fixed value and which is not compensated for by a simultaneous 
opposite transaction of a corresponding size and nature.
The Group buys metals in the form of raw materials which it processes 
into refined metals, and where the acquisition value of the raw materials 
as well as the exchange rates may differ from the final sales value. Such 
differences arise as a result of variations in size, purchasing date, process-
ing and/or selling. Furthermore, some customers receive fixed prices in 
different currencies that are sometimes set well in advance of delivery. 
Boliden’s policy stipulates that these risks must always be hedged in full, 
with the exception of the smelters’ process inventory – see below for details. 
The Group uses futures contracts to ensure that the sale price and exchange 
rate correspond to those applicable in conjunction with the purchase of the 
input raw material. This risk management ensures that exchange rate and 
metal price fluctuations do not impact the profit in conjunction with the 
revaluation of stocks and other working capital items.
The Group’s smelters keep process inventory for which the price risk, 
expressed in volume of metal, is maintained at a constant level. Boliden’s 
policy is not to hedge this price exposure and changes in the market prices 
of these metals and exchange rates consequently impact the Group’s 
profits in conjunction with revaluations of the process inventory. The 
exposure to price changes in any stock volumes above or below the con-
stant level is, however, always hedged. See also Risk Management, 
revaluation of process inventory on page 36 in the Directors’ Report.
Structural exposure
This structural exposure arises from the fact that a substantial percentage 
of the Group’s future income – primarily that relating to extracted metals 
and to treatment and refining charges – is affected by fluctuations in metal 
prices and exchange rates.
Boliden’s policy is normally not to metal price hedge and currency hedge 
the Group’s future income. Boliden does, however, continuously calculate 
the way in which market changes in the currency market or metal markets 
affect the Group’s future key ratios. In order, where necessary, to limit 
significant effects of negative market scenarios, Boliden evaluates, among 
other things, the use of financial derivative instruments. There may be 
special justification, in conjunction with major investments or investments

Cont. note 19
in mines with short lifespans, for limiting financial risks through the use 
of derivatives.
The Group can use futures and option agreements to hedge against 
metal price and/or exchange rate fluctuations in relation to forecast metal 
sales. Note 21 contains tables showing Boliden’s exchange rate and metal 
price hedging with regard to the structural exposure of exchange rates 
and metals. The same Note also contains a sensitivity analysis showing 
the effects on the profit on a yearly basis of changes in metal prices and 
exchange rates. The Note also details the effects of derivative instruments 
used on other comprehensive income in conjunction with a change of 10 
per cent in exchange rates and metal prices.
Translation exposure
When net investments in foreign operations (other comprehensive income 
and surplus values allocated Group-wide to overseas subsidiaries) are 
converted into Swedish kronor, a translation difference arises in conjunc-
tion with exchange rate fluctuations, and this has an impact on the Group’s 
other comprehensive income. The effect of this exposure is eliminated by 
utilising currency futures and external borrowing in the corresponding 
foreign currency, in accordance with Boliden’s finance policy. During 2009, 
other comprehensive income has been affected to the tune of SEK 338 
million (SEK –941 m) by hedging in currency futures contracts and bor-
rowing in foreign currencies. The Income Statement has not been affected 
during the year as the hedging against net investments in foreign curren-
cies has been effective.
Interest risk
Fluctuations in the market interest rates affect the Group’s profits and 
cash flows. The speed with which a change in interest rates impacts on 
the Group’s net financial items depends on the fixed interest term of the 
loans. On 31st December 2009, the Group’s loan portfolio had an average 
fixed interest term of 2.1 years (0.2 years). Boliden concluded interest 
swaps during the second quarter of 2009 and the majority of the debt 
will consequently have a fixed interest term for a period of just under four 
years. Boliden’s finance policy allows for an average fixed interest term of 
up to 3 years. On an annual basis, a change of one percentage point in 
the market interest rate entails an effect on the profit of +/– SEK 28 mil-
lion (SEK 63 m) before tax, calculated on the basis of the net debt and 
outstanding interest swaps on 31st December 2009. At the turn of the 
year, the net market value of the interest swaps totalled SEK –60 million 
(–). A positive change of one percentage point in the market interest rate 
increases the net market value of interest swaps and other comprehensive 
income, before tax, by SEK 139 million (–), as of 31st December 2009.
Energy price risk
Boliden conducts energy-intensive operations and is thus vulnerable to 
the long-term energy price trend. Boliden endeavours to use long-term 
contracts and, in this way, has secured the majority of its energy require-
ments in the form of supplier contracts at fixed prices. The contracts are 
also complemented on an ongoing basis with electricity derivatives over 
a three-year horizon. A change in electricity prices will consequently have, 
in the short term, a very limited effect on the profit. At the turn of the year, 
Boliden held electricity derivatives corresponding to 956 GWh (729 GWh) 
with a net market value of SEK –30 million (SEK –131 m). A change of 10 
per cent in the electricity price has an effect on the net market value of 
electricity derivatives and other comprehensive income of +/– SEK 44 
million (SEK 33 m), before tax, as of 31st December 2009.
Refinancing and current liquidity risk
The term “refinancing and current liquidity risk” refers to the risk that 
Boliden will be unable to extend existing loans or meet its payment under-
takings due to insufficient liquidity. Boliden limits its refinancing risk by 
ensuring that its gross loan liability has a good spread in terms of coun-
terparties, financing sources and lengths. Boliden works actively to ensure 
satisfactory current liquidity by making appropriate use of unutilised credit 
facilities with operationally adjusted loan durations. The credit facilities 
mature between 2011 and 2016 and the refinancing requirement is
68
boliden annual report 2009
reviewed regularly by Boliden’s centralised treasury function, which is 
responsible for external borrowing. The refinancing requirement is depend-
ent, first and foremost, on market trends and investment plans. The loan 
agreements carry loan covenants which oblige Boliden to comply with 
certain defined key ratio conditions in order to avoid early repayment. A 
rapid deterioration in the global economic climate may entail increased 
risks in respect of profit performance and financial position, including the 
risk of Boliden coming into conflict with loan terms and conditions. On 
31st December 2009, Boliden’s loan duration totalled 3.8 years (4.8 
yrs) and its current liquidity was SEK 6,924 million (SEK 8,319 m) in liquid 
assets and unutilised binding credit facilities, less deductions for com-
mercial papers issued.
Boliden has established a cash pool structure that enables it to maintain 
a central overview of liquidity flows and ensure efficient management of 
the Group’s overall liquidity. Any surplus liquidity is used to amortise exter-
nal liabilities, as Boliden is a net borrower.
Credit and counterparty risk
The term “credit and counterparty risk” refers to the risk that a counter-
party in a transaction may fail to fulfil their obligation, thus causing the 
Group to incur a loss. The concentration risk is principally measured as 
exposure per counterparty. In order to limit counterparty risk, only highly 
creditworthy counterparties are accepted in accordance with Boliden’s 
finance policy, and wherever possible, the commitment per counterparty 
is limited. These restrictions are laid down in Boliden’s financial policy in 
the form of lowest acceptable credit ratings and maximum investment of 
liquid assets per counterparty. The maximum credit exposure on the clos-
ing date (31st December 2009) was SEK 3,565 million (SEK 4,983 m).
Credit risks in financial operations
Boliden’s financial exposure to counterparty risk mainly occurs when trad-
ing in derivative instruments. In order to limit this exposure, netting 
agreements have been signed in accordance with the stipulations of the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), such that, for 
example, if a counterparty is declared bankrupt, receivables and liabilities 
are netted. On 31st December 2009, the total counterparty exposure 
in derivative instruments corresponded to a net market value of SEK 984 
(SEK 2,746 m) (net assets with banks and metal brokers). The creditwor-
thiness and counterparty spread of these receivables is deemed to be 
good. The lowest credit rating with Standard & Poor’s of Boliden’s coun-
terparties is A.
Boliden’s finance policy mandates that Boliden only invests its liquid 
assets, as per Boliden’s definition of cash assets and short-term invest-
ments, with issuers who have an A credit rating or better with Standard 
& Poor’s.
Credit risks in accounts receivable
The risk of the Group’s customers failing to fulfil their obligations consti-
tutes a credit risk. Credit risks are managed through an established credit 
rating process, active credit monitoring, short credit periods and daily 
routines for monitoring payments. The requisite provisions for bad debts 
are also monitored continuously. The single biggest account receivable 
corresponds to one fifth of the Group’s total accounts receivable on 31st 
December 2009. The concentration of accounts receivable is otherwise 
low and the credit periods are short. The quality of the accounts receiv-
able is deemed to be very good. Write-downs of outstanding accounts 
receivable on 31st December 2009 have only been affected in very limited 
amounts and have also, historically speaking, been insignificant. See also 
Note 14 Accounts Receivable, on page 64.
Risk management and insurance
The objective of the Risk Management function at Boliden is to minimize 
the total cost of the Group’s damage and injury risks. This is achieved both 
by continuously enhancing the damage and injury prevention and control 
work conducted within the operations, and by introducing and developing 
Group-wide insurance solutions.

Loan portfolio
Existing syndicated credit facilities totalling SEK 4,300 million and EUR 
600 million, respectively, expire between 2011 and 2013. The utilised 
component of the credit facilities totalled SEK 3,434 million (SEK 3,389 
m) on 31st December 2009. Boliden has also issued a number of directed 
bonds to Swedish and Nordic institutions and which, on 31st December 
2009, totalled SEK 3,175 million (SEK 3,272 m) with a duration of 
between 3 and 7 years. Boliden’s short-term borrowing comprises a 
Swedish commercial papers programme with a framework amount of 
SEK 2,500 million. On 31st December 2009, SEK 976 million (SEK 353 
m) remained outstanding.
The average contractual term of the loan liability on 31st December 
2009 was 3.8 years (4.8 yrs) and the debt portfolio’s average interest 
rate was 2.62 per cent (5.18%). Boliden concluded 4-year interest hedg-
ing agreements during the second quarter of 2009 in the form of interest 
swaps corresponding to 63 per cent of the current loan liability. The hedged
part of the debt will consequently have an average interest rate of 3.6 per 
cent, based on current loan terms. The interest swaps entered into extend 
the fixed interest term, which totalled 2.1 years (0.2 yrs) on 31st December 
2009, and will achieve its full impact on Boliden’s interest payments and 
net financial items as of the first quarter of 2010. Boliden’s current liquid-
ity, in the form of liquid assets, unutilised overdraft facilities, less deductions 
for commercial papers issued, totalled SEK 6,924 million (SEK 8,319 m) 
on 31st December 2009.
The duration profile for the financial liabilities (including interest pay-
ments) above includes the undiscounted cash flows that derive from the 
Group’s liabilities, based on the contracted remaining durations at the end 
of the financial year. The interest flows, including interest swaps, together 
with future fixing dates, are estimated on the basis of the Group’s closing 
interest rates.

NOTES
Cont. note 21
The scope of the analysis
The analysis of sensitivity to changes in metal prices does not take into 
account the effects of metal price hedging and revaluation of the smelters’ 
process stocks.
The analysis of sensitivity to changes in exchange rates does not take 
into account the effects of currency hedging. It should be noted that the 
analysis’ assumptions with regard to the LME prices have a substantial 
effect on the estimated exchange rate exposure and hence on the sensi-
tivity to exchange rate fluctuations.
The analysis of sensitivity to changes in treatment and refining charges 
does not take contracted treatment charges into account. The sensitivity
analysis does not include assumptions regarding such factors as inflation, 
discrepancies in production trends and macroeconomic conditions.
The analysis’ starting points
The calculation of the effect of a 10 per cent rise in the price of metals is 
based on changes in metal prices in relation to the so-called “cash price” 
on LME on 31st December 2009. The effect of a 10 per cent strengthen-
ing of the US dollar is based on changes in relation to the spot rates on 
31st December 2009. The effect of a 10 per cent rise in treatment and 
refining charges is based on changes from the average levels for Q4 
2009.
Sensitivity analysis – Other comprehensive income
The following table contains an estimation of the effect on other comprehensive income, before tax, of changes in the value of financial instruments, 
based on closing day prices on 31st December 2009 (31st December 2008). Changes in the value of financial instruments with regard to transaction 
exposure and translation exposure have either a very limited or no effect on the profit or other comprehensive income. The following table hence 
exclusively includes the effects of changes in the value of financial derivatives intended to meet the Group’s structural exposure.

1) Level classification in accordance with a fair value hierarchy is shown for assets and liabilities valued at fair value.
The reported value is held to correspond, in every significant respect, to the fair value. The accounts receivables’ fair value is held to be the same as 
the fair value due to the shortmaturity date, to the fact that provision has been made for bad accounts receivable, and to the fact that any penalty 
interest is debited. The same is true for accounts payable with short maturity dates and no long credit periods. The reported value of liabilities to credit 
institutions is held to exceed the fair value, both on 31st December 2008 and on 31st December 2009, due to the fact that interest margins in the 
credit market have risen substantially since existing credit facilities were agreed. The difference between reported value and fair value is calculated 
as the difference between discounted contractual interest flows during the remaining term of the loans and the corresponding discounted interest 
flows plus anticipated relevant interest margins.

In addition to the above specifications under the heading of contingent lia-
bilities and in the financial information provided, the possibility exists that 
the Group may incur environmentally related contingent liabilities or contin-
gent liabilities attributable to legal proceedings which cannot currently be 
calculated, although they may in the future entail costs or investments.
The Parent Company sureties refer to guarantees issued for subsidiar-
ies. SEK 9,872 million (SEK 11,035 m) refers to Parent Company guar-
antees for external financial borrowing. Parent Company sureties in the 
above table have been booked in the amount utilised. Guarantees in 
respect of unutilised credits total SEK 8,600 million (SEK 9,615 m). 
2008’s figures for Parent Company sureties have been complemented 
in comparison with previous years’ annual accounts.
Legal proceedings 
Overview
Boliden conducts extensive domestic and international operations and is 
occasionally involved in disputes and legal proceedings arising in the course 
of these operations. These disputes and legal proceedings are not 
expected, over and above those detailed below, either individually or col-
lectively, to have any significant negative impact on Boliden’s operating 
profits, profitability or financial position.
Disputes
Copper tubing cartel 
In September 2004, the European Commission fined Boliden AB and its 
two former subsidiaries, Boliden Cuivre et Zinc SA (“BCZ”) and its parent 
company, Boliden Fabrication AB. The fine totalled EUR 32.6 million. At
boliden annual report 2009

NOTES
Cont. note 23
the same time, seven other companies were fined. Boliden has made a 
provision for the fine. According to the European Commission, BCZ and 
the other companies have engaged in activities designed to restrict com-
petition in the European market for sanitary copper tubing during the period 
from 1988 to 2001. In all significant respects, Boliden has acknowledged 
the European Commission’s description of the factual circumstances but 
has, in its appeal against the Commission’s ruling, requested a reduction 
in the amount of the fine. A ruling on the issues is expected in 2010.
Since 2005, Boliden has received summonses as part of a number of 
class actions that have been brought in various States in the USA against 
the companies covered by the European Commission’s ruling. The company 
has contested these actions, some of which have been dismissed. Boliden 
is currently only involved in two class actions in California, one state and 
one federal, and expects both to be dismissed in the near future.
BCZ and Boliden Fabrication AB have been transferred to Outokumpu. 
Boliden has undertaken to indemnify Outokumpu for claims that may arise 
relating to the period up to the transfer of the companies to Outokumpu.
Disputes arising from the dam breach accident in Spain 
In April 1998, a dam breach occurred in a tailings pond at the Los Frailes 
mine in Spain, which was then owned by Boliden’s subsidiary, Boliden 
Apirsa S.L. (“Apirsa”).
Following the dam breach, criminal proceedings were initiated against 
Apirsa and its representatives. In December 2000, the prosecutor with-
drew the proceedings. The ruling was appealed but finally ratified in 
November 2001. The criminal proceedings determined that the accident 
was caused by design and construction errors in the dam, not by Apirsa’s 
operations at the mine.
Notwithstanding the outcome of the criminal proceedings, the Spanish 
Ministry of the Environment declared Apirsa liable to pay an amount cor-
responding to approximately EUR 45 million in clean-up costs, damages 
and fines. This resulted, in January 2005, in Apirsa initiating so-called 
insolvency proceedings in order to ensure a coordinated and orderly 
closure of the company. Within the framework of the insolvency proceed-
ings, the receivers in bankruptcy have requested that Apirsa’s parent 
company, Boliden BV, together with Boliden Mineral AB and Boliden AB, 
shall be held liable for Apirsa’s shortfall. The local Commercial Court in 
Seville has issued an interim sequestration order on property belonging 
to Boliden Mineral AB and Boliden AB to a total value of EUR 141 million 
as security for alleged claims arising from the dam breach accident. The 
companies have appealed the ruling. The receivers in bankruptcy have, 
subsequent to the previous interim sequestration order, applied to the 
Svea Court of Appeal to have the ruling declared enforceable in Sweden. 
The Svea Court of Appeal has, under the provisions of the rules governing 
the enforcement of rulings by foreign courts of law, declared that the 
ruling is enforceable in Sweden, with, however, the provisions that the 
counterparty must pledge EUR 141 million in security to Boliden. The 
insolvency proceedings notwithstanding, Apirsa is continuing to pursue 
the suit mentioned below against the companies responsible for the design 
and construction of the dam at which the accident occurred.
As a result of the dam breach, the local government (the Junta de 
Andalucia) sued Apirsa, Boliden BV and Boliden AB in a civil court for dam-
ages totalling approximately EUR 89 million. The suit was dismissed on 
formal legal grounds. The ruling was appealed, but the appeal was rejected 
by a higher court in the autumn of 2003. Since the dismissal of the suit 
in the civil court, the local government in Andalusia has initiated administra-
tive proceedings against Apirsa, Boliden BV and Boliden AB in respect of 
the same claim. In these proceedings, the Junta de Andalucia has itself 
enjoined the three companies to pay the amount claimed. Apirsa, Boliden 
BV and Boliden AB have appealed the decision to the Administrative Court. 
In November 2007, the Court declared the order issued by the Junta de 
Andalucia invalid. The Junta de Andalucia has appealed the ruling.
Based on the legal advice and opinions given by the company’s Spanish 
legal counsel, Boliden’s overall view is that the company will not suffer any 
substantial financial damage as a result of the legal proceedings described. 
The company has made no provisions pending final rulings.
74
boliden annual report 2009
During 2002, following the determination in the criminal proceedings that 
the dam breach was caused by design and construction errors, Apirsa 
initiated proceedings in civil court against the companies responsible for 
the dam’s design and construction and against their insurance companies. 
The court rejected Apirsa’s case in November 2006 and in September 
2009. Apirsa has appealed to the supreme court.
Pensions at Tara 
In 1999, Tara Mines amended its pension plan with regard, among other 
things, to the calculation of pensionable salaries. The company subse-
quently became involved in a dispute regarding the interpretation of the 
agreement for personnel whose employment by the company had ended 
when the agreement was amended. The issue is awaiting a ruling by 
Ireland’s Supreme Court in 2010, and if the ruling were to go against the 
company, it could entail an increase in the pension undertakings of Boliden 
Tara Mines Ltd. of approximately SEK 80 million.
Tax proceedings 
Odda
Boliden Odda AS and the Norwegian tax authority have reached an agree-
ment during the year regarding a zinc processing agreement entered into 
between Boliden Odda AS and Boliden Zinc Commercial BV.
Security for reclamation costs
In 2008, the Environmental Court Division of the Umeå District Court 
ruled that Boliden Mineral AB shall provide a total of SEK 660 million as 
security for reclamation costs that may result from the Aitik operations. 
In a separate ruling, the Environmental Court approved the provision of 
security in the form of a parent company guarantee issued by Boliden AB. 
The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency does not regard security 
in the form of a parent company guarantee as acceptable and has appealed 
this aspect of the Environmental Court ruling to the Environmental Supreme 
Court. The Environmental Supreme Court has, in a ruling from January 
2010, stayed the proceedings, pending a ruling by the Supreme Court 
on a case regarding the form of security to be provided for the Hötjärn 
tailings pond in the Boliden Area.

AND STATEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SWEDISH COM-
PANIES ACT, 18:4
Boliden has a dividend policy whereby approximately one third of the 
profit after tax is to be distributed. The Board of Directors proposes that 
the Annual General Meeting approve payment of a dividend of SEK 3 
(SEK 1) per share, or a total of SEK 821 million (SEK 274 m), corresponding 
to 32.8 per cent of the profit after tax for 2009. The Parent Company’s 
non-restricted shareholders’ equity totals SEK 1,753 million and the 
Group’s total shareholders’ equity amounts to SEK 16,257 million. Finan-
cial instruments have been valued at fair value, entailing an increase in 
the Group’s shareholders’ equity of SEK 495 million. The non-restricted 
shareholders’ equity in the Parent Company will total SEK 932 million 
and the Group’s shareholders’ equity, SEK 15,436 million, after payment 
of the proposed dividend to the shareholders. The Board has taken the 
cyclic nature of the industry and the risks associated with the operations 
into account in its dividend proposal.
The Board of Directors and the President hereby attest that the Annual 
Accounts have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles in Sweden and that the Consolidated Accounts 
have been prepared in accordance with EU-approved International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards, IFRS.

AUDIT REPORT
AUDIT REPORT
To the Annual Meeting of the shareholders of Boliden AB (publ.)
Corporate identity number 556051-4142
We have audited the Annual Accounts, the Consolidated Accounts, the 
accounting records and the administration of the Board of Directors and 
the President of Boliden AB for 2009. The company’s Annual Accounts 
and the Consolidated Accounts are presented in the printed version of 
this document on pages 13–77. The Board of Directors and the President 
are responsible for these accounts and the administration of the company 
as well as for the application of the Annual Accounts Act when preparing 
the Annual Accounts and the application of the International Financial 
Reporting Standards, IFRS, as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts 
Act when preparing the Consolidated Accounts. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the Annual Accounts, the Consolidated Accounts 
and the administration based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted audit-
ing standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we plan and per-
form the audit to obtain reasonable but not absolute assurance that the 
Annual Accounts and the Consolidated Accounts are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the accounts. An audit also 
includes assessing the accounting principles used and their application 
by the Board of Directors and the President, and significant estimates 
made by the Board of Directors and the President, when preparing the 
Annual Accounts and Consolidated Accounts as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of information in the Annual Accounts and the 
Consolidated Accounts. As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge 
from liability, we examined significant decisions, actions taken and cir-
cumstances of the company in order to be able to determine the liability, 
if any, to the company of any Board member or the President. We also 
examined whether any Board member or the President has, in any other 
way, acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts 
Act or the Articles of Association. We believe that our audit provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion set out below.
The Annual Accounts have been prepared in accordance with the 
Annual Accounts Act and give a true and fair view of the company’s 
financial position and results of operations in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in Sweden. The Consolidated Accounts 
have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards, IFRS, as adopted by the EU and the Annual Accounts 
Act and give a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and 
results of operations. The statutory administration report is consistent 
with the other parts of the Annual Accounts and the Consolidated 
Accounts.
We recommend to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders that the 
Income Statements and Balance Sheets of the Parent Company and the 
Group be adopted, that the profit of the Parent Company be dealt with 
in accordance with the proposal in the administration report, and that 
the members of the Board of Directors and the President be discharged 
from liability for the financial year.

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
Mineral resources and ore reserves are a mining company’s most impor-
tant assets. Th  e long-term growth of a mining company depends on explo-
ration that results in mineral resources and ore reserves being augmented 
faster than they are depleted by mined production. Th  e end product of 
exploration work lies far into the future and is associated with a degree of 
uncertainty –there are no guarantees that positive results yielded by ini-
tial fi eld exploration will ultimately lead to a producing asset. A minimum 
of fi ve to ten years – sometimes even longer – can often pass between the 
fi rst positive results and a new mine becoming operational.
POSITIVE TREND IN RECENT YEARS
Increased mineral resources, which can be upgraded to ore reserves at a 
later stage, are the result of successful exploration work. If growth is to 
be achieved, the net of these increases and the mine’s production rate 
must be positive.
Boliden’s increased investments in exploration since 2003 have led to sub-
stantial net increases, particularly at Garpenberg and Aitik. Th  e Boliden 
Area has reported very positive development in this respect over the last fi ve 
years, while Tara’s net mineral resources and ore reserves have fallen.
ORE RESERVE CALCULATIONS, 2009
Mining companies are obliged to produce a calculation of their mineral 
resources and ore reserves on a yearly basis. Boliden’s calculations and 
summaries are conducted in accordance with international regulations 
and recommendations issued by SveMin, the Swedish Association of 
Mines, Mineral and Metal Producers. See below for further information 
on how the calculations have been performed and the identity of the indi-
viduals responsible for them.
Boliden’s ore reserves and mineral resources generally continued to 
develop positively in 2009, despite certain cutbacks in mine-site explo-
ration in late 2008 and the fi rst half of 2009. Th  e positive trend was largely 
due to successful exploration and improved long-term forecasts for metal 
prices at the end of 2009.
Positive exploration results generated a substantial increase in Aitik’s 
mineral resources during the year, with 460 million tonnes added to the
resources. Th  e Salmijärvi area, which is located close to Aitik’s existing 
open pit mine, boosted the ore reserve from 633 million tonnes to 747 
million tonnes – a fi gure which, given planned production levels, gives 
Aitik a lifespan of 19 years or to 2029. Th  e average copper head grade at 
Aitik was 0.25 per cent in 2009, in comparison with a fi gure of 0.27 per 
cent in the 2008 calculations.
Mineral resources increased at Garpenberg by 3.5 million tonnes as a 
result of improved prices and successful exploration of the Kvarnberget 
mineralisation. Garpenberg’s ore reserves totalled 25.9 million tonnes, 
which, at planned production levels, yields a lifespan of 19 years. Garpen-
berg’s average zinc head grade increased from 5.1 per cent in 2008 to 5.4 
per cent in 2009.
Th  e net additions to mineral resources and ore reserves in the Boliden 
Area totalled 1.8 million tonnes and 1.3 million tonnes, respectively. Th  e 
changes are largely due to successful exploration work in Renström and 
Kristineberg, which increased the mineral resources, and in Kankberg, 
which increased the ore reserve. At the planned production rate, the Boli-
den Area has a lifespan of 6 years.
Tara’s mineral resources total 11.8 million tonnes, corresponding to a 
reduction of 10 per cent in comparison with the 2008 calculations. Pos-
itive exploration results and, to some extent, improved metal prices, 
meant that the growth in ore reserves was essentially on a par with the 
quantities mined in 2009. Th  e ore reserve of 17 million tonnes means 
that Tara has a lifespan of 7 years at planned production levels.
For further information on ore reserves and mineral resources on 31st
December 2009, see the tables on pages 81 and 82.
ABOUT THE CLASSIFICATION
Mining companies divide their mineral resources into diff erent catego-
ries, depending on how much is known about the deposit. Technical anal-
yses that enable an assessment to be made of whether the resource will 
become profi table are required before a mineral resource can be upgraded 
to an ore reserve.
A mineral resource is a concentration of minerals in the bedrock that 
may become commercially extractable. Ore reserves are those parts of a

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
mineral resource that can be mined and processed in accordance with the 
company’s demands on profitability, taking into account factors such as 
waste rock dilution, pillar offset and process recoveries.
Mineral resources are divided into three categories, while ore reserves
are divided into two.
Inferred mineral resource
An inferred mineral resource is a mineral resource that has been identi-
fied through drilling, sampling and geoscientific interpretations, but 
where the information is so sparse that the geology and grade continuity 
of the deposit cannot be confirmed and where the basic technical data 
consists of reasonable assumptions. This means that continued investi-
gations will not, with any degree of certainty, enable the entire inferred 
mineral resource, or parts of it, to be moved to a higher category.
Indicated mineral resource
An indicated mineral resource is a mineral resource that has been iden-
tified through drilling and sampling with an information density that is 
too sparse to confirm continuity, but which, together with geoscientific 
interpretations, nevertheless provide a reasonable idea of the deposit’s 
geology and grade continuity. Collectively, the information and inter-
pretations are sufficient to enable technical and economic calculations 
to be performed to assess the project’s profitability.
Measured mineral resource
A measured mineral resource is a mineral resource where the information 
obtained from drilling and sampling confirms the deposit’s geology and 
grade continuity. The basic technical data is such that mining plans can 
be drawn up. These plans then form the basis for technical and economic 
analyses of the project’s profitability in the next stage of the process.
Metal prices
In the main, long-term price forecasts are utilised when calculating ore 
reserves, and are an expression of the anticipated average prices for met-
als and currencies over the forthcoming business cycle. Boliden currently 
uses the following long-term price forecasts:
Copper
Zinc 
Lead 
Gold 
Silver 
USD/SEK
EUR/SEK
4,500 USD/tonnes
2,000 USD/tonnes
1,600 USD/tonnes
750 USD/tr.oz
10 USD/tr.oz
7.50
9.10
Density
A formula based on head grades is utilised for large polymetallic ores, 
which make up the majority of Boliden’s mineral resources and ore 
reserves. In other cases, density measurements are made for the various 
ore types.
Waste rock dilution
Mining usually incurs some waste rock dilution that varies depending on 
the mining method used, the ore’s geometry, and other geological factors. 
Waste rock dilution is taken into account in all ore reserve calculations.
Ore losses
Depending on the mining method used, the ore’s geometry, and other tech-
nical factors, some ore may have to be left unextracted, known as pillar off-
set. Based on the information available when the calculations were made, 
all the ore reserve calculations have taken these factors into account.
Probable ore reserve
A probable ore reserve is those parts of a measured or indicated mineral 
resource where mining-engineering and profitability studies show that 
it is technically and economically feasible to mine and process the deposit 
in line with the company’s demands on profitability.
Minimum ore width
The minimum horizontal ore width is determined by the mining method 
and equipment used in the respective mines. This means that grades of 
ore zones narrower than the minimum ore width are recalculated to give 
an average for the full width.
Proven ore reserve
A proven ore reserve is those parts of a measured mineral resource where 
mining-engineering and profitability studies show that it is technically 
and economically feasible to mine and process the deposit in line with 
the company’s demands on profitability.
BASIS FOR THE CALCULATIONS
Boliden holds the required environmental permits and exploitation con-
cessions for all of the mines currently in operation. The mineral resources 
are protected by exploitation concessions or exploration permits. Boliden’s 
mineral resources and ore reserves are reported separately in the Group’s 
summary of its calculations, i.e. the Group’s mineral resources are reported 
in addition to the ore reserves (see the tables on pages 81−82).
The calculations are based on the following underlying factors:
Cut-off grades
The lowest grade to be mined is calculated separately for each deposit on 
the basis of its characteristics, that is to say the direct costs for mining, 
ore haulage, milling, concentrate haulage and administration. The costs 
are compared with the value of the product, taking into account the rel-
evant payment terms for processing by the smelters.

REGULATIONS, CODES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Boliden’s ore reserves and mineral resources have been calculated and 
compiled in accordance with the Australasian Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgy’s JORC code. This is comparable with, and equivalent to, the 
“Cim Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, Definitions 
and Guidelines” adopted by Cim on 20th August 2000, which consti-
tutes that part of the Ontario Securities Commission (Osc) rules and reg-
ulations, National Instrument 43–101, that regulates how ore reserves and 
mineral resources should be reported.
Boliden complies with and reports in accordance with Ni 43–101 and 
the recommendations adopted by SveMin, which, wherever applica-
ble, are identical to the Canadian rules.
The mineral resources and ore reserves have been compiled under 
the supervision of Gunnar Agmalm, a “Qualified Person” according to 
Ni 43–101 and registered as a “Qualified Person” by SveMin. Gunnar 
Agmalm is a member of Ausimm, and has more than 20 years’ experi-
ence in the mining and minerals industry.
Calculations for Tara have been carried out under the supervision of 
John Ashton, Chief Mine Geologist, Boliden Tara Mines Ltd. John 
Ashton is a ”Qualified Person” and a member of the Institute of Mate-
rials, Minerals and Mining and of the Institute of Geologists Ireland, 
and has more than 25 years’ experience of the mining and minerals 
industry.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Boliden is a Swedish limited company listed on the Nasdaq omx Stock-
holm Stock Exchange, with a secondary listing on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange. Boliden’s corporate governance is based on the Swedish Com-
panies Act, the regulations of the Nasdaq omx Stockholm Stock Exchange, 
and the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the Code). At the time 
when the third quarterly report for 2009 was published, only the date of the 
2010 Annual General Meeting had been determined. Th  e location at which 
it will be held will be determined and announced at a later date and Boli-
den accordingly reports a deviation from rule 1.1 of the Code regarding the 
announcement of the time and place for the Annual General Meeting. Boli-
den has otherwise not deviated from the Code. Th  e Corporate Governance 
Report has not been subjected to review by the company’s Auditors.
GOVERNANCE OF THE BOLIDEN GROUP
Corporate Governance is designed to ensure that Boliden is governed in 
line with the owners’ interests. Increased transparency gives diff erent 
groups of owners a good insight into the company’s operations, thereby 
contributing to effi  cient governance.
Th  e shareholders exercise their right of decision at the Annual General 
Meeting (and at any Extraordinary General Meeting), which is the compa-
ny’s supreme decision-making body. Th  e Board of Directors is appointed 
at the Annual General Meeting and the company’s President is appointed 
by the Board of Directors. Th  e company’s accounting and the administra-
tion of the company by the Board of Directors and the President are 
reviewed by auditors appointed by the Annual General Meeting. Th  e 
Annual General Meeting also appoints fi ve members to a Nomination 
Committee and authorises the Committee to appoint one or two additional 
members, if necessary. Th  e Nomination Committee drafts proposals that 
are put to the Annual General Meeting with regard to, among other things, 
elections of and the fees payable to the Board of Directors and auditors.
Over and above its compliance with legislative provisions, regulations 
and the Code, Boliden also applies internal governance instruments, such 
as the Group’s organisational and operational philosophy, the New Boli-
den Way (Nbw), the Code of Conduct, and policies in such areas as the

NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
The Annual General Meeting passes resolutions on the principles gov-
erning the appointment and duties of the Nomination Committee. The 
Nomination Committee shall, in accordance with the Instructions for the 
Nomination Committee adopted by the Annual General Meeting, com-
prise a minimum of five and a maximum of seven members. Five mem-
bers shall be elected at the Annual General Meeting, of whom three shall 
represent the biggest shareholders and one the smaller shareholders, and 
one of whom shall be the Chairman of the Board. The Nomination Com-
mittee appoints its own Chairman and works in the best interests of all 
shareholders. The Nomination Committee may, in order better to reflect 
the shareholder structure in the event of changes in ownership, offer 
places on the Committee to other larger shareholders.
Composition of the Nomination Committee 
In September, the Chairman of the Board convened the members elected 
by the Meeting for the election of the Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, at which time Anders Algotsson (Afa Försäkring) was 
appointed Chairman. Eva Halvarsson replaced Carl Rosén as the repre-
sentative of Andra Ap-fonden and Caroline af Ugglas also joined the 
Nomination Committee as a representative of Skandia, which has become 
one of the three biggest shareholders. The composition of the Nomina-
tion Committee was announced on Boliden’s website and through a press 
release dated 29th April 2009.
Duties of the Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee is tasked with drafting proposals for resolution 
by Boliden’s Annual General Meeting. The proposals relate to, among other 
things, the election of Members of the Board, the Chairman of the Board, 
fees payable to the Board and its committees, and fees payable to the compa-
ny’s auditors. The focus of the Nomination Committee’s work is on ensuring 
that the company’s Board of Directors comprises Members who, collectively, 
possess the knowledge and experience that corresponds to the requirements 
made of the company’s most senior governing body by the shareholders. The

boliden annual report 2009
Chairman of the Board presented the evaluation conducted of the work of 
the Board and the individual Members during the past year as part of the 
process of drafting proposals for Board Members. The President presented 
the company’s operations and future orientation. The Nomination Commit-
tee was also afforded the opportunity to meet the Members of the Board. The 
evaluation of the Board and the assessment of the competencies that the Board 
should possess during the coming period resulted in the Nomination Com-
mittee agreeing to propose the re-election of  all Members.
Information on the way in which shareholders can submit proposals 
to the Nomination Committee has been published on Boliden’s website. 
Full details of the Nomination Committee’s proposals will be presented 
in the Notice convening the Annual General Meeting and in informa-
tion provided on the company’s website.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Boliden’s Board of Directors shall, under the provisions of the Articles of 
Association, comprise a minimum of three and a maximum of ten Mem-
bers, without Deputy Members, elected by the Annual General Meet-
ing. The company’s employees have a statutory entitlement to appoint 
three Members and three Deputy Members to the Board.
The composition of the Board
The Board of Directors has comprised eight Members elected by the 
Annual General Meeting and three Members appointed by the trade 
union organisations since the 2009 Annual General Meeting. The Board 
Meetings are attended both by the ordinary Members and by the union 
Members’ three Deputy Members.
Boliden’s Cfo and Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs (the latter is 
also the Board’s Secretary) also attend the meetings on behalf of the Group 
management. Other members of the Group management and other exec-
utives also attend and present reports on individual issues as required.
The Board Members elected by the Annual General Meeting are all to 
be regarded as independent in relation to major shareholders, and all, 
with the exception of the President, to be regarded as independent in rela-
tion to Boliden and the Group management.
The Members of the Board are presented on page 90–91 and on 
 Boliden’s website. For more detailed information on attendance at the 
Meetings and independence, see the table above.
The responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Chairman
The Board of Directors is appointed by Boliden’s owners to bear ultimate 
responsibility for the organisation and management of the company’s 
affairs. The Board adopts a Formal Work Plan every year at the Board 
Meeting following the election, held after the Annual General Meeting. 
The Formal Work Plan regulates the work and the responsibilities of the 
Board in greater detail, together with the special duties with which the 
Chairman of the Board is tasked. The division of labour between the 
Board of Directors and the President is clarified in the written Instruc-
tions to the President adopted by the Board at the same meeting. In 2009, 
the Board has, as in previous years, established an Audit Committee and 
a Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman of the Board guides the work of the Board and moni-
tors Boliden’s operations through an ongoing dialogue with the Presi-
dent. The Board receives information on Boliden’s economic and finan-
cial position through monthly reports and at Board Meetings. Prior to 
every Board Meeting, the Chairman and the President review the issues 
to be discussed at the Meeting and the source data for the Board’s discus-
sion of the issues is sent to the Members approximately one week before 
each Board Meeting.
The Board of Directors’ work in 2009
The Board of Directors held seven ordinary Board Meetings in 2009.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
A number of the Board Meetings are regularly held at the company’s oper-
ating units in order to give the Members an increased insight into the 
operations. In 2009, the Board visited the Rönnskär copper smelter and 
the Kokkola zinc smelter.
At the beginning of every year, the Board sets a number of themes that 
it particularly wishes to address during the year. Some of the main issues 
during the year, in addition to the operational review conducted at every 
Board Meeting, were: 
•		No.	1	(February):	2008	Year	End	Report,	investment	issues,	acquisi-
tion issues, auditors’ report, energy supply, developments at Tara, 
 currency hedging 
•		No.	2	(March):	Matters	for	the	Annual	General	Meeting
•		No.	3	(April):	Q1 Interim Report, market analysis, capital structure, 
 delegation organisation, currency hedging, organisational changes 
•		No.	4	(April):	Board	Meeting	following	election	after	the	Annual	
General Meeting, authority to sign for the company, resolution on 
the Board’s Formal Work Plan and Instructions for the President, res-
olutions on Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee 
•		No.	5	(July):	Q2 Interim Report, the global metals market, acquisition 
issues, the Boliden Area, investment in pumping station at Aitik  
•		No.	6	(October):	Q3 Interim Report, exploration, the New Boliden 
Way, action programme for Tara, nuclear power project
•		No.	7	(December):	Business	plan	and	budget,	auditors’	report,	man-
agement skill pools and management development, the market for 
sulphuric acid.
At the Board Meetings held in February and December, Boliden’s audi-
tors presented reports detailing their observations from the audit of the 
company. The Board has had the opportunity to meet the auditors with-
out the presence of the Group management on two occasions.
Evaluation of the Board’s work
The Chairman ensures that the Board and its work are evaluated annu-
ally and that the results of the evaluation are conveyed to the Nomina-
tion Committee. The evaluation is carried out by the Board itself under 
the guidance of the Chairman or, at regular intervals, with the help of an 
independent consultant. The 2009 evaluation was a self-evaluation dur-
ing which the Members answered a number of questions in writing on a 
range of different subjects and held one-on-one discussions with the 
Chairman of the Board, followed by a joint discussion.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets before the publication of every financial 
report, and as necessary. The Committee is tasked with assuring the qual-
ity of Boliden’s financial reporting. This requires, among other things, 
that the company has a satisfactory organisation and appropriate proc-
esses. Boliden has an internal control function whose work involves map-
ping risk areas and following up on work in identified areas.
The Audit Committee works on the basis of a set of Instructions for 
the Audit Committee adopted every year by the Board of Directors and 
reports back to the Board on the results of its work. Special attention was 
paid in 2009 to accounting issues, with particular reference to impair-
ment tests, and to the valuation of process inventory, loan terms, IT secu-
rity and following up on internal controls. The Audit Committee com-
prises Ulla Litzén (Chairwoman), Anders Sundström and Anders Ullberg. 
The Audit Committee met five times in 2009.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee submits proposals for resolution by the 
Board regarding salaries and other terms of employment for the Presi-
boliden annual report 2009
87
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
dent. The Committee also approves proposals regarding salaries and other 
terms of employment for the Group management, as proposed by the 
President. The Remuneration Committee is, furthermore, tasked with 
submitting proposals regarding remuneration principles etc. for the Pres-
ident and Group management, which proposals are then submitted by 
the Board to the Annual General Meeting, which decides on the issue. 
The Remuneration Committee works on the basis of a set of Instruc-
tions for the Remuneration Committee adopted every year by the Board 
of Directors and reports back to the Board on the results of its work. The 
Committee has held three meetings during the year and the members 
have had extensive contact by telephone. The Remuneration Commit-
tee comprises Anders Ullberg (Chairman), and Staffan Bohman.
See Note 1 for an account of the remuneration paid to the Group man-
agement on pages 57–58.
BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
Management by the Board goes through a chain of command from the 
President to the operating units. Boliden works on the basis of the com-
pany’s organisational and operational philosophy, the New Boliden Way 
(Nbw), which is updated annually. Boliden has an organisation in which 
responsibilities and authority are delegated within clear frameworks. 
These frameworks are defined by an annual budget which is broken down 
by unit, a strategic plan, and Boliden’s steering documents. The steering 
documents are available on Boliden’s intranet and make up the internal 
framework required for efficient management. These documents include 
the Financial Policy, the Communications Policy, the Environmental 
Policy and the Health and Safety Policy.
THE PRESIDENT AND GROUP MANAGEMENT
Boliden’s Group management comprises the President, the heads of the 
Group’s two Business Areas, Mines and Smelters, and the Senior Vice 
Presidents for the Group Treasury and Finance, Legal Affairs, Human 
Resources and Sustainable Development staff functions. The Group 
management prepares proposals regarding strategic plans, business plans 
and budgets, which are submitted to the Board for approval by the Pres-
ident. The President leads the work of the Group management, which 
holds regular monthly meetings to review operations.
The company’s 150 or so senior managers and specialists meet annu-
ally to set important goals and strategies at management meetings, where 
they also have the opportunity for discussions aimed at establishing wide-
spread support for the measures proposed.
See page 92 for a presentation of the Group management team.
AUDITORS
The accounting firm of Ernst & Young Ab was elected at the 2009 Annual 
General Meeting to serve as the company’s auditors until the conclusion 
of the 2013 Annual General Meeting. Authorised Public Accountant Lars 
Träff is the senior auditor.
Lars Träff’s audit engagements, in addition to Boliden, include Avanza,
Lantmännen, Posten, Scania, Åf and Investment Ab Öresund.
Remuneration is paid to the company’s auditors in accordance with 
invoices received as agreed. See Note 2 on page 58 for information on 
remuneration disbursed in 2009.
INTERNAL CONTROL REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The purpose of internal control with regard to financial reporting is to 
provide reasonable assurance with regard to the reliability of the external 
financial reporting and to ensure that the reports are produced in accord-
ance with generally accepted accounting principles, applicable legislation 
and statutes, and with other requirements imposed on listed companies.  
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that an 
efficient internal control system exists within the Boliden Group. The
88
boliden annual report 2009
President is responsible for the existence of a process and organisation 
thatensures internal control and the quality of the internal and external 
financial reporting.
Internal control function
Boliden has an internal control function responsible for implementing 
processes and frameworks that secure internal control and ensure the 
quality of the financial reporting.
The function reports to the Head of the Treasury and Finance func-
tion and presents reports on issues relating to internal control at the Audit 
Committee’s meetings.
Control environment
The control environment within Boliden is characterised by the fact that 
the Group has relatively few but large operating units that have carried 
out their operations for many years, using well-established processes and 
control activities.
A structure of steering documents in the form of binding policies and 
guidelines for the organisation’s delegated responsibilities has been estab-
lished to ensure a collective attitude and methodology within the Group. 
The starting point is the New Boliden Way (Nbw), together with asso-
ciated steering documents which include the Code of Conduct, deci-
sion-making and authorisation instructions, and a financial manual cov-
ering financial policy, accounting and reporting instructions.
Local management systems with more detailed instructions and
descriptions of important processes have also been set up.
Work continued at both Business Area and Group level in 2009 on 
charting the financial transaction flows, identifying risks and document-
ing control activities in a uniform and standardised way.
Risk analysis
The operating units conduct ongoing risk analyses with regard to finan-
cial reporting. All units shall, within the framework of the work that 
began in 2008 and continued in 2009, map and evaluate risks in the var-
ious accounting and reporting processes.
Control activities
Various types of control activities are carried out within the Group and 
within every different aspect of the accounting and reporting process on 
an ongoing basis. The control activities are carried out in order to man-
age known risks and to detect and rectify any errors and discrepancies in 
the financial reporting.
Documentation of significant control activities within the account-
ing and reporting process continued in 2009.
Information and communication
Information on policies, guidelines and manuals is available on Boliden’s 
intranet. Information on updates and changes to reporting and account-
ing principles is issued by e-mail and at the regular treasury and control-
ler meetings.
External information is provided and communication conducted in 
accordance with the Group’s Communications Policy. All information 
must be communicated in a discerning, open and transparent manner. 
The structure of the intranet has been improved in 2009, increasing acces-
sibility and the ability to find the right information quickly. All Group-wide 
steering documents were updated and communicated during the year.
Follow-ups
Systems, processes and controls within the Group are followed up, improved 
and developed continuously.
Areas where scope for improvement is identified in conjunction with
audits are documented, analysed and actioned.

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS
Alloy  Substance with metallic properties which is composed of two 
or more chemical elements, at least one of which is a metal.
into three categories: assumed mineral resources, inferred mineral 
resources and measured mineral resources.
Base metals   The most common metals, including zinc, copper, 
lead, nickel and aluminium.
Cash cost   Common measurement used to show the costs affec-
ting a mine’s cash flow, converted into US dollars (average rate for the 
measurement period). Used to compare the mine’s cost position in 
relation to other mines. See page 101.
Complex ore  Ore that contains several metals, for example zinc, 
copper, lead, gold and silver.
Concentrator   A plant in which ore is processed mechanically and/
or chemically to extract and produce a concentrate of the valuable 
minerals.
Copper cathode  An end product from copper smelters in the form 
of 99.99 per cent pure copper plates.
Feed  The smelter’s raw material consumption, i.e. the amount of 
metal concentrate or secondary material processed and refined.
Field exploration  Exploration in new areas. Associated with higher 
costs in comparison with mine-site exploration.
Free metals  The percentage of metal concentrates bought in that 
an individual smelter can process over and above the payable metal 
content. This percentage generates income without incurring a raw 
material cost.
Galvanising   An electrochemical process whereby a metal is coated 
with a thin layer of another metal, such as zinc. Galvanising is com-
monly used to protect against corrosion (rust).
ISO  International Organization for Standardization. International 
standardisation organisation. Standards include environmental mana-
gement (ISO 14001) and quality (ISO 9001), etc.
LBMA  London Bullion Market Association. International market 
responsible for the daily pricing of precious metals.
LME  London Metal Exchange. International market where non-fer-
rous metals are bought and sold. Trading on the LME is used as the 
basis for the daily pricing of metals worldwide. The LME also main-
tains warehouse stocks of the metals traded.
Metal concentrate  Also known as dressed ore. Metal concentrate 
is the result of the separation out, through concentration processes, 
of the economically valuable minerals in an ore from those with no 
economic value.
Metal content  The quantities of zinc, copper, lead, gold and silver, 
for example, contained in concentrates. Zinc concentrates generally 
contain 55 per cent zinc metal while copper concentrates generally 
contain approximately 30 per cent copper metal. The lead content of 
mined concentrate is usually around 65 per cent.
Metal premium  The price agreed in advance, over and above the 
LME price, and paid by customers for specifically adapted metal that 
is supplied to them.
Mineralisation  A concentration of minerals in the bedrock.
Mineral resource  A concentration of minerals in the bedrock that 
may become commercially extractable. Mineral resources are divided 
100
boliden annual report 2009
Mine-site exploration  Exploration in the vicinity of existing mines.  
New deposits located close to existing mines mean a shorter time 
from discovery to production because the infrastructure is already  
in place.
Open pit  A method of mining mineral deposits located near the surface. 
The waste rock is stripped and the ore mined directly at the surface.
Ore  Economic term for minerals, rock types or other bedrock 
 components that can be profitably mined to extract metals or other 
 valuable substances.
Ore grade  The average quantities of valuable metals in a tonne  
of ore, expressed in grams per tonne for precious metals and as  
a percentage for other metals.
Ore reserves  Those parts of a mineral resource that can be mined 
and processed in accordance with the company’s profitability require-
ments and taking into account factors such as waste rock dilution and 
the percentage of metal in an ore that can be extracted in the concen-
tration process. Ore reserves are divided into two categories: proba-
ble ore reserves and proven ore reserves.
Payable metal content  The percentage of the metal content of the 
concentrate for which the smelters pay when purchasing concentrate.
Precious metals  Metals that are less common than base metals, 
for example gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
Price escalators (PP)  Price distribution clauses in the agreements 
for zinc treatment charges that spread the effect of changes in metal 
prices between the mine and the smelter. There have been no price 
escalator clauses in copper treatment and refining charge agree-
ments for many years now.
Recovery  The percentage portion of the quantity of a given metal  
in an ore extracted during the concentration process.
Secondary materials  Various types of recycling materials from 
which metals can be recovered, for example electronic and metal 
scrap, metal ashes, slag, dust and scrap lead batteries.
Smelter  A plant in which metal raw materials, metal concentrates 
or secondary materials are processed to separate metals from impu-
rities by means of high-temperature reactions.
Treatment and refining charges (TC/RC)  The remuneration recei-
ved by a smelter for processing smelting material (concentrates and 
secondary materials) and extracting metals. Copper smelters’ pro-
cesses can be broken down into a treatment phase and a refining 
phase, while zinc smelters’ processes only involve a treatment phase, 
and hence zinc smelters’ remuneration only comprises a treatment 
charge (TC).
Underground mine  Mine where the ore is mined using underground 
tunnels. The mining methods used in underground mines include the 
cut-and-fill method and sub-level stoping.
Waste rock  Economic term for rock which, unlike ore, contains no 
valuable material.
Zinc ingot  An end product from zinc smelters with detailed specifi-
cations with regard to degree of purity, weight and size.

on metal prices while good metal concentrate avai-
lability increases demand for smelter capacity and 
thereby boosts treatment and refi ning charges.
HIGH METAL PRICES AND LOW TC/RC
Metal shortages in the market boost metal prices 
while metal concentrate shortages reduce demand 
for smelter capacity and thereby put downwards 
pressure on treatment and refi ning charges.
