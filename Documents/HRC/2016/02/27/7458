</p>
<p>&#8220;The Human Rights Council:  
</p>
<p>1. Deplores the fact that the Ebola virus has claimed, and continues to 
</p>
<p>claim, the lives of so many people in West Africa, including health workers, and is 
</p>
<p>deeply concerned at the horrifying loss of life and the impact that the spread of the 
</p>
<p>disease has on life and health, as well as on the enjoyment of all human rights by 
</p>
<p>persons in the States concerned, in particular the rights to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of health and to an adequate standard of living; 
</p>
<p>2. Calls upon all States to respect, protect and promote all human rights 
</p>
<p>on the basis of equality while combating the epidemic on the ground; 
</p>
<p>3. Expresses concern at the panic caused in reaction to misinformation 
</p>
<p>and inadequate communication about the Ebola virus, with the consequence of  
</p>
<p>worsening the situation and undermining the right of persons to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of health; 
</p>
<p>4. Expresses grave concern at the negative impact of Ebola on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of rights by individuals in the countries affected<i>, </i>and on trade and food 
</p>
<p>security, the disruption to mining, agriculture, domestic and cross-border trade, air 
</p>
<p>travel, investments as well as the diversion of public funds to fight the epidemic; 
</p>
<p>5. Notes that the Ebola outbreak has been declared a public health 
</p>
<p>emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization; 
</p>
<p>6. Welcomes the tireless work of Governments of the States affected by 
</p>
<p>the Ebola crisis, the World Health Organization, M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res and the 
</p>
<p>International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to ensure that 
</p>
<p>adequate treatment is provided to victims, support is provided to their families and 
</p>

<p>international organizations are given access to work freely and unhindered within 
</p>
<p>their territories;  
</p>
<p>7. Commends the work of all individuals and organizations around the 
</p>
<p>world committed to preventing the spread of Ebola, as well as the work of those 
</p>
<p>providing treatment to persons affected by the disease; 
</p>
<p>8. Commends all States, organizations, including non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, other entities and individuals that have provided assistance in cash 
</p>
<p>and in kind, including the large number of medical professionals, in response to the 
</p>
<p>emergency, and urges the international community to increase and escalate its 
</p>
<p>assistance to ensure the containment of the virus; 
</p>
<p>9 Calls upon health service providers to ensure that health workers are 
</p>
<p>provided with adequate training and the protective gear necessary to minimize their 
</p>
<p>risk of infection by the disease; 
</p>
<p>10. Calls upon Governments of the States affected to provide adequate 
</p>
<p>security to protect all health workers from violence; 
</p>
<p>11. Acknowledges the steps being taken by the Economic Community of 
</p>
<p>West African States and the African Union to halt and fight the spread of the Ebola 
</p>
<p>virus, and urges urgent action on their plans; 
</p>
<p>12. Urges States to be mindful of the human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms of citizens of the States affected when implementing measures to limit the 
</p>
<p>spread of the virus and of the negative effects of inappropriate actions that could 
</p>
<p>result in the stigmatization of victims, including not only those directly affected by 
</p>
<p>the current epidemic but also the families of infected persons, the communities in 
</p>
<p>which they live and the citizens of the States and regions most affected by the 
</p>
<p>disease, as such inappropriate actions that lead to stigmatization will only deepen the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of the Ebola crisis on the enjoyment of human rights; 
</p>
<p>13. Requests States and international organizations to take all the steps 
</p>
<p>necessary to support the rapid establishment of an African centre for disease control 
</p>
<p>and prevention, including the enhancement of the early warning systems to address, 
</p>
<p>in a timely and effective manner, all health emergencies and the coordination and 
</p>
<p>harmonization of domestic health regulations and interventions, as well as the 
</p>
<p>exchange of information on good experiences and best practices; 
</p>
<p>14. Calls upon the international community, the special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant United Nations specialized 
</p>
<p>agencies and regional and subregional organizations to make the greatest effort, 
</p>
<p>within their specific mandates, to reverse the impact of the Ebola virus on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights in affected countries by providing them with technical, 
</p>
<p>material and financial assistance; 
</p>
<p>15. Calls upon Member States, relevant international and regional 
</p>
<p>organizations, regional economic communities, partners of Africa, the public sector 
</p>
<p>and other relevant actors on the ground, including the private sector, to work closely 
</p>
<p>together to mobilize adequate resources to respond to the Ebola virus crisis, in the 
</p>
<p>spirit of international solidarity and in a well-coordinated and transparent manner; 
</p>
<p>16. Calls upon States to implement the recommendations of the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization and international health regulations in taking measures of 
</p>
<p>prevention and containment.&#8221;
