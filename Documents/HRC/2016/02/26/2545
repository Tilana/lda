<p><b>  </b>22/&#8230;<b> Protecting human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 53/144 of 9 December 1998, by which the 
Assembly adopted by consensus the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms annexed to that resolution, and reiterating the 
importance of the Declaration and its promotion and implementation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the continued validity and application of all the provisions of the 
above-mentioned Declaration, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> all previous resolutions on this subject, in particular Human Rights 
Council resolutions 13/13 of 25 March 2010 and 16/5 of 24 March 2011, and General 
Assembly resolution 66/164 of 19 December 2011, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that States are under the obligation to protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all persons, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that human rights defenders play an important role at the local, 
national, regional and international levels in the promotion and protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p> <i>Stressing</i> that respect and support for the activities of human rights defenders, 
including women human rights defenders, is essential to the overall enjoyment of human 
rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should 
facilitate the work of human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization, 
stigmatization, impediments, obstructions or restrictions thereof contrary to international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the grave concerns expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 
66/164 regarding the serious nature of risks faced by human rights defenders due to threats, 
attacks and acts of intimidation against them, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned</i> that, in some instances, national security and counter-terrorism 
legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, have 
been misused to target human rights defenders or have hindered their work and endangered 
their safety in a manner contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> in this regard that new forms of communication, including the 
dissemination of information online and offline, can serve as important tools for human 
rights defenders to promote and strive for the protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent 
and stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights 
defenders to exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, amending 
relevant legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance with international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the steps taken by some States towards adopting policies or legislation 
for the protection of individuals, groups and organs of society engaged in promoting and 
defending human rights, including the decriminalization of defamation, that serve to protect 
human rights defenders from being prosecuted for peaceful activities, and against threats, 
harassment, intimidation, duress, arbitrary detention or arrest, violence and attacks by State 
and non-State actors; 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the work of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, including her two latest reports submitted pursuant to General Assembly 
resolution 66/164 and Human Rights Council resolution 16/5, on the use of legislation 
affecting the activities of human rights defenders,1 and national human rights institutions, 2 
respectively; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> States to create a safe and enabling environment in which human 
rights defenders can operate free from hindrance and insecurity, in the whole country and in 
all sectors of society, including by extending support to local human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> that legislation affecting the activities of human rights defenders and 
its application must be consistent with international human rights law, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and guided by the Declaration on the Right and 
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and, in this regard, 
condemns the imposition of any limitations on the work and activities of human rights 
defenders enforced in contravention of international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 1 A/67/292.  </p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/22/47. </p>


<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that legislation designed to guarantee public 
safety and public order contains clearly defined provisions consistent with international 
human rights law, including the principle of non-discrimination, and that such legislation is 
not used to impede or restrict the exercise of any human right, including freedom of 
expression, association and peaceful assembly, which are essential for the promotion and 
protection of other rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> States to acknowledge publicly the important and legitimate role of 
human rights defenders in the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law as 
an essential component of ensuring their protection, including by respecting the 
independence of their organizations and by avoiding the stigmatization of their work; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that human rights defenders can perform their 
important role in the context of peaceful protests, in accordance with national legislation 
consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international human rights law and, in 
this regard, to ensure that no one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate use of force, 
arbitrary arrest or detention, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, enforced disappearance, abuse of criminal and civil proceedings or threats of 
such acts; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Underlines</i> that the access to and use of information technologies and the 
media of one&#8217;s choice, including radio, television and the Internet, should be promoted and 
facilitated at the national level, between States and at the international level as an integral 
part of the enjoyment of the fundamental rights to freedom of opinion and expression, and 
also encourages international cooperation aimed at the development of media and 
information and communications technologies in all countries; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to respect, protect and ensure the right to freedom of 
association of human rights defenders and, in this regard, to ensure, where procedures 
governing the registration of civil society organizations exist, that these are transparent, 
accessible, non-discriminatory, expeditious and inexpensive, allow for the possibility to 
appeal and avoid requiring re-registration, in accordance with national legislation, and are 
in conformity with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls</i> <i>upon</i> States to ensure that reporting requirements placed on 
individuals, groups and organs of society do not inhibit functional autonomy, and that 
restrictions are not discriminatorily imposed on potential sources of funding aimed at 
supporting the work of human rights defenders other than those ordinarily laid down for 
any other activity unrelated to human rights within the country to ensure transparency and 
accountability, and that no law should criminalize or delegitimize activities in defence of 
human rights on account of the geographic origin of funding thereto; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that measures to combat terrorism and preserve 
national security: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular 
under international human rights law, and do not hinder the work and safety of individuals, 
groups and organs of society engaged in promoting and defending human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Clearly identify which offences qualify as terrorist acts by defining 
transparent and foreseeable criteria, including, inter alia, considering without prejudice 
those formulated by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Prohibit and do not provide for, or have the effect of, subjecting persons to 
arbitrary detention, such as detention without due process guarantees, the deprivation of 
liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the law, or the 
illegal deprivation of liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, nor </p>


<p>the unlawful deprivation of the right to life or the trial of suspects without fundamental 
judicial guarantees; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Allow appropriate access for relevant international bodies, non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions, where such exist, to persons detained 
under anti-terrorism and other legislation relating to national security, and to ensure that 
human rights defenders are not harassed or prosecuted for providing legal assistance to 
persons detained and charged under legislation relating to national security; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to ensure that all legal provisions and their 
application affecting human rights defenders are clearly defined, determinable and non-
retroactive in order to avoid potential abuse to the detriment of fundamental freedoms and 
human rights, and specifically to ensure that: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The promotion and the protection of human rights are not criminalized, and 
that human rights defenders are not prevented from enjoying universal human rights owing 
to their work, whether they operate individually or in association with others, while 
emphasizing that everyone shall respect the human rights of others; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The judiciary is independent, impartial and competent to review effectively 
legislation and its application affecting the work and activities of human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Procedural safeguards, including in criminal cases against human rights 
defenders, are in place in accordance with international human rights law in order to avoid 
the use of unreliable evidence, unwarranted investigations and procedural delays, thereby 
effectively contributing to the expeditious closing of all unsubstantiated cases, with 
individuals being afforded the opportunity to lodge complaints directly with the appropriate 
authority; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Any provision or decision that may interfere with the enjoyment of human 
rights must respect fundamental principles enshrined in international law so that they are 
lawful, proportionate, non-discriminatory and necessary in a democratic society; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Information held by public authorities is proactively disclosed, and that 
transparent and clear laws and policies provide for a general right to request and receive 
such information, for which public access should be granted, except for narrow and clearly 
defined limitations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Restrictions are not invoked on access to information regarding grave 
violations of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) That provisions do not prevent public officials from being held accountable, 
and that penalties for defamation are limited in order to ensure proportionality and 
reparation commensurate to the harm done; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) Legislation aimed at preserving public morals is compatible with 
international human rights law;  
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) Legislation does not target activities of individuals and associations 
defending the rights of persons belonging to minorities or espousing minority beliefs; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) Dissenting views may be expressed peacefully; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Expresses</i> <i>particular concern</i> about systemic and structural discrimination 
and violence faced by women human rights defenders, and calls upon States to integrate a 
gender perspective in their efforts to create a safe and enabling environment for the defence 
of human rights; </p>


<p> 13. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of everyone, individually and in association with others, 
to unhindered access to and communication with international bodies, in particular the 
United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, including 
the Human Rights Council, its special procedures, the universal periodic review mechanism 
and the treaty bodies, as well as regional human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Strongly calls upon</i> all States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To refrain from, and ensure adequate protection from, any act of intimidation 
or reprisals against those who cooperate, have cooperated or seek to cooperate with 
international institutions, including their family members and associates; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To fulfil the duty to end impunity for any such acts of intimidation or 
reprisals by bringing the perpetrators to justice and by providing an effective remedy for 
their victims; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To avoid legislation that has the effect of undermining the right reaffirmed in 
paragraph 13 above; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Reaffirms</i> the necessity for inclusive and open dialogue between civil society 
actors, particularly human rights defenders, and the United Nations in the field of human 
rights and, in this context, underlines that participation by civil society should be facilitated 
in a transparent, impartial and non-discriminatory manner; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Underlines</i> the value of national human rights institutions, established and 
operating in accordance with the Paris Principles, in the continued monitoring of existing 
legislation and consistently informing the State about its impact on the activities of human 
rights defenders, including by making relevant and concrete recommendations; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Stressing</i> <i>in particular</i> the valuable contribution of national human rights 
institutions, civil society and other stakeholders in providing input to States on the potential 
implications of draft legislation when such legislation is being developed or reviewed to 
ensure that it is in compliance with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Invites </i>leaders in all sectors of society and respective communities, including 
political, social and religious leaders, and leaders in business and media, to express public 
support for the important role of human rights defenders and the legitimacy of their work; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Encourages</i> States to include in their reports for the universal periodic review 
and to treaty bodies information on the steps taken to create a safe and enabling 
environment for human rights defenders, including by bringing legislation and its 
application affecting the activities of human rights defenders into line with international 
human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Encourages</i> national human rights institutions, civil society and other 
stakeholders to provide information, including to States, in the context of the universal 
periodic review and the work of treaty bodies, on the enabling environment for human 
rights defenders, including legislation and its application affecting the activities of human 
rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, the Special Rapporteur, relevant regional mechanisms and national human rights 
institutions to offer their assistance for the consideration of States in bringing their 
legislation and its application into line with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Invites</i> States to seek assistance, including that which may be provided by the 
above-mentioned actors, in the process of reviewing, amending or developing legislation 
that affects or would affect, directly or indirectly, the work of human rights defenders; </p>


<p> 23. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders to 
continue to execute the activities under her mandate, including in the follow-up to the 
present resolution, by monitoring progress and by providing guidance, assistance and 
follow-up with States, as needed; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
