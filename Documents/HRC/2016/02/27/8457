<p><b> I. Introduction</b>1 
</p>
<p>1. In its resolution 14/3, the Human Rights Council requested its Advisory Committee, 
in consultation with Member States, civil society, academia and all relevant stakeholders, to 
prepare a draft declaration on the right of peoples to peace and to report on the progress 
thereon to the Council at its seventeenth session. 
</p>
<p>2. In its recommendation 5/2, the Advisory Committee designated Chinsung Chung, 
Miguel d&#8217;Escoto Brockmann, Wolfgang Stefan Heinz (Rapporteur) and Mona Zulficar 
(Chairperson) as members of the drafting group.2 The drafting group, later expanded to 
include Shigeki Sakamoto and Latif H&#252;seynoy, submitted a draft progress report to the 
Advisory Committee for consideration at its sixth session. The present report will be 
submitted to the Council for its consideration at its seventeenth session.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to peace in international law and practice 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Charter of the United Nations begins by proclaiming international peace and 
security as a common purpose, in Article 1; as a principle, in Article 2; and as the basis for 
dispute settlement in Chapter VI (Arts. 33-38). In Article 55, the Charter refers to the 
promotion of human rights as a necessary condition for peaceful and friendly relations 
between States. The right to peace is inherent in the Charter. 
</p>
<p>4. The United Nations plenary principal organ, the General Assembly, has recognized 
the right to peace in numerous resolutions, with a minority of Member States abstaining. 
Most notably, in the annex to its resolution 34/11, the Assembly proclaimed that &#8220;the 
peoples of our planet have a sacred right to peace&#8221;. This was reaffirmed in subsequent 
Assembly resolutions, in particular in resolutions 53/243, 57/216, 60/163 and 63/189. The 
right was also affirmed by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolutions 5 (XXXII) 
76, 2000/66 and 2002/71, and by the Human Rights Council in its resolutions 8/9, 11/4 and 
14/3. A number of countries have consistently abstained or voted against these resolutions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination states in its preamble that discrimination between human beings on the 
grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly and peaceful relations 
among nations and is capable of disturbing peace and security among peoples.3  
</p>
<p>6. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights notes in its preamble that 
human rights are the foundation of peace in the world.4 In its general comment No. 6, the 
Human Rights Committee emphasizes the relationship between the right to life, prevention 
of war and the prohibition of propaganda for war, including the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons; in its general comment No. 14 on nuclear weapons and the right to life, it draws a 
clear link between the prohibition of war and the right to life. 
</p>
<p>7. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
states that the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the 
</p>

<p>cause of peace requires the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in 
all fields.5 
</p>
<p>8. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has an optional protocol on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict.6 
</p>
<p>9. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities reaffirms the crucial role 
of human rights in general for creating fair and equal societies founded upon freedom, 
justice, development and peace.7 
</p>
<p>10. Article 23 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights unambiguously 
recognizes that all peoples &#8220;shall have the right to national and international peace and 
security&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Charter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of 2007 reiterates the 
common desire of its member States to live in peace (in its preamble) and to maintain and 
enhance peace (several times in articles 1 and 2 and in its provisions calling for the peaceful 
settlement of disputes). 
</p>
<p>12. Civil society organizations, especially the Spanish Society for International Human 
Rights Law, and many other non-governmental organizations have also recognized the 
existence of a right to peace in numerous documents prepared by experts and endorsed by 
hundreds of non-governmental organizations. The Santiago Declaration on the Human 
Right to Peace of December 2010 was the result of a four-year world campaign of the 
Society that brought together inputs from all regions of the world. The initiative is 
noteworthy in its deliberate effort to seek universal values by drawing upon local and 
international law from Western and non-Western legal traditions. An international 
observatory of the human right to peace was also created. More than 900 civil society 
organizations and cities have endorsed the United Nations documents submitted through the 
Society. 
</p>
<p>13. In 1998, more than 200 non-governmental organizations drafted an Asian human 
rights charter over a three-year discussion process. The Charter asserts that &#8220;all persons 
have a right to peace so that they can fully develop all their capacities, physical, 
intellectual, moral and spiritual, without being the target of any kind of violence&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p><b> III. Approach proposed by the Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>14. In its resolution 14/3, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory Committee 
to prepare a draft declaration on the right of peoples to peace, in consultation with Member 
States, civil society, academia and all relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>15. In its resolutions 8/9, 11/4 and 14/3, the Council recognized the right to peace;  a 
number of Member States voted against the resolution. 
</p>
<p>16. The Advisory Committee suggests a focused approach to clarify the right to peace 
and to enhance its implementation. 
</p>
<p>17. The Advisory Committee therefore proposes that peace should be conceived as both 
the absence of organized violence within a country or between countries and the

<p>comprehensive and effective protection of human rights, gender equality and social justice, 
economic well-being and free and widespread expression of different cultural values, 
without discrimination or restraints.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Core dimensions  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International peace and security 
</b></p>
<p>18. In its resolution 14/3, the Human Rights Council reaffirmed that the peoples of our 
planet have a sacred right to peace, and also that the preservation of the right of peoples to 
peace and the promotion of its implementation constitute a fundamental obligation of all 
States and stresses the importance of peace for the promotion and protection of all human 
rights for all. It reaffirmed standards from previous resolutions of the General Assembly 
and the Council, as well as articles from the Charter of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>19. The purposes of the United Nations, as set out in Article 1 of the Charter, are to 
maintain international peace and security and to take appropriate measures to strengthen 
universal peace. Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter require the Organization and all its 
Member States with a view to the creation of stability and well-being, which are necessary 
for peaceful and friendly relations among nations, to promote universal respect for, and 
observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. 
</p>
<p>20. The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations 
and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations 
stresses the importance of maintaining and strengthening international peace founded upon 
freedom, equality, justice and respect for human rights.9 
</p>
<p>21. This right has been repeated reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolutions. 
For example, in 1978, the Assembly reaffirmed the right of individuals, States and all 
mankind to life in peace in its Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in 
Peace.10 It added that every nation and every human being, regardless of race, conscience, 
language or sex, has the inherent right to life in peace. Respect for that right, as well as for 
the other human rights, is in the common interest of all mankind and an indispensable 
condition of advancement of all nations, large and small, in all fields. 
</p>
<p>22. The Declaration of the Right of Peoples to Peace solemnly declared that the peoples 
of our planet have a sacred right to peace and that every State has a fundamental obligation 
to promote and implement this right. 
</p>
<p>23. At the 2010 Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held in Kampala, the State 
parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court agreed to add aggression to 
the Court&#8217;s short list of prosecutable crimes. The members adopted by consensus 
amendments to the Rome Statute, including a definition of the crime of aggression and a 
regime establishing how the Court would exercise its jurisdiction over this crime.11 An act 
of aggression is defined as the use of armed force by one State against another State 
without the justification of self-defence or authorization by the Security Council.12

 10 General Assembly resolution 33/73.

</p>
<p>available from www.iccnow.org/?mod=aggression. 
 12 The definition, as well as the actions qualifying as acts of aggression contained in the amendments 
</p>
<p>(for example, invasion by armed forces, bombardment and blockade), are influenced by General 
 </p>


<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. The peoples of our planet have a human right to peace. 
</p>
<p> 2. The preservation, promotion and implementation of the right of peoples to 
peace constitute a fundamental obligation of all States. 
</p>
<p> 3. Peace and development are fundamental human rights that are the pillars of 
the United Nations system and the foundations for human security and well-being; 
</p>
<p> 4. Exercise of the right of peoples to peace and its promotion and 
implementation demand that the policies of States are directed towards the elimination of 
the threat of war, particularly nuclear war, the renunciation of the use or threat of use of 
force in international relations and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful 
means on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> 5. All States shall promote the establishment, maintenance and strengthening of 
international peace and security in an international system based on respect for the 
Principles enshrined in the Charter and the promotion of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, including the right to development and the right of peoples to self-determination; 
</p>
<p> 6. All States shall respect and put into practice the Principles and Purposes of 
the Charter in their relations with all other States, irrespective of their political, economic or 
social systems or of their size, geographical location or level of economic development, 
particularly refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes 
of the United Nations and further refraining from intervening in matters which are 
essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State; 
</p>
<p> 7. All States, in accordance with the Principles of the Charter, shall use peaceful 
means to settle any dispute to which they are parties and the continuance of which is likely 
to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, and encourages States to 
settle their disputes as early as possible, as an important contribution to the promotion and 
protection of all human rights of everyone and all peoples.13 
</p>
<p> 8. To strengthen international rule of law, all States should strive to support the 
International Criminal Court and its work on crimes against humanity, war crimes, the 
crime of genocide and the crime of aggression.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Disarmament 
</b></p>
<p>24. The manufacture of weapons, arms races and the excessive and uncontrolled traffic 
of all kinds of arms jeopardize international peace and security. The failure of States to 
observe the obligations laid down in the relevant treaties in the field of disarmament, 
including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the possession, 
deployment and threat of use of weapons impedes respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>25. The continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a permanent threat to world 
peace, as their use would have catastrophic consequences for all life on earth and 
humankind in general.14 The Human Rights Committee has recognized that the designing, 
</p>
<p>  
Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX). See &#8220;US opposes ICC bid to make 'aggression' a crime under 
international law&#8221;, <i>CSMonitor</i>, 15 June 2010. 
</p>
<p> 13 See General Assembly resolution 39/11 (1984), Human Rights Council resolutions 8/9 (2008), 11/4 
and 14/3 (paras. 6-10), and Article 2 of the Charter.  
</p>
<p> 14 The Russell-Einstein Manifesto, London, 9 July 1955, resolution.  </p>


<p>testing, manufacture, possession and deployment of nuclear weapons are among the 
greatest threats to the right to life which confront humankind today.15 In its advisory 
opinion on the <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons</i> of 8 July 1996, the 
International Court of Justice unanimously concluded that article VI of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other international commitments required States 
to &#8220;pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear 
disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control&#8221;. An annual 
General Assembly resolution welcoming the Court&#8217;s conclusion calls for negotiations on a 
convention prohibiting and eliminating nuclear weapons globally as the means of meeting 
the obligation.16  
</p>
<p>26. Weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, 
do not only have an instant negative effect on peoples and individuals and the enjoyment 
and exercise of a variety of their human rights. The development, production, stockpiling 
and use of weapons of mass destruction or of indiscriminate effect may also imply 
unforeseeable, uncontrollable and long-term and cross-border effects on the environment 
threatening the livelihood of succeeding generations. 
</p>
<p>27. The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of 
Environmental Modification Techniques17 states in article 1 that each State party to the 
Convention undertakes not to engage in military or any other hostile use of environmental 
modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects as the means of 
destruction, damage or injury to any other State party.  
</p>
<p>28. The final outcome document of the International Conference on the Relationship 
between Disarmament and Development18 concluded that true and lasting peace and 
security in this interdependent world demanded rapid progress in both disarmament and 
development as two of the most urgent challenges facing the world today. 
</p>
<p>29. The Secretary-General has underlined that disarmament contributes to creating a 
more stable international and national order that is favourable to development and human 
rights.19 Several initiatives by the United Nations have also addressed the international arms 
trade and illegal arms trade.20 
</p>
<p>30. The right to full disarmament must be understood to be part of the right of peoples to 
live in peace. The right to disarmament should be a component of the right of peoples to 
peace as well as part of the right to international solidarity.21 
</p>
<p>  
 15 General comment No. 14 on nuclear weapons and the right to life (Art. 6), 1984, para. 4.  
 16 See for example General Assembly resolution 64/55.  It is significant that, at the 2010 Treaty Review 
</p>
<p>Conference, for the first time, the Action Plan on Nuclear Disarmament, in the final document, 
affirms that &#8220;all States need to make special efforts to establish the necessary framework to achieve 
and maintain a world without nuclear weapons.&#8221; It then notes the Five-Point Proposal for Nuclear 
Disarmament of the Secretary-General, proposing, inter alia, consideration of negotiations on a 
nuclear weapons convention or agreement on a framework of separate mutually reinforcing 
instruments, backed by a strong system of verification. The 2010 Review Conference thus 
acknowledged that elimination of nuclear weapons would require a global institutional and legal 
system.

<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. All peoples and individuals have the right to demand from all States that they 
urgently eliminate all weapons of mass destruction or of indiscriminate effect, including 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. States shall engage actively in the strict and 
transparent control of arms trade and suppression of illegal arms trade. Furthermore, States 
should proceed in a joint and coordinated manner and within a reasonable period of time to 
further disarmament, under comprehensive and effective international supervision.22 
</p><p> 2. All peoples and individuals have the right to have the resources freed by 
disarmament allocated to the economic, social and cultural development of peoples and to 
the fair redistribution of natural wealth, responding especially to the needs of the poorest 
countries and of groups in situations of vulnerability, aiming to put an end to inequalities, 
social exclusion and extreme poverty.23 
</p>
<p> 3. All peoples and individuals have the right to live in a sustainable and safe 
environment as a foundation for peace and for the survival of mankind. 
</p>
<p> 4. All peoples and individuals have a right to live in a world free of weapons of 
mass destruction. The use of weapons that damage the environment, in particular 
radioactive weapons and weapons of mass destruction, is contrary to international 
humanitarian law, the right to the environment and the human right to peace. Such weapons 
must be urgently eliminated and prohibited, and States that utilize them have the obligation 
to restore the previous condition of the environment by repairing all damage caused. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human security  
</b></p>
<p>31. The right to peace includes the element of human security. Human security focuses 
on the basic needs of the human being. It includes both the twin values of freedom from 
fear and freedom from want.24 The first refers to threats from conflicts and the protection of 
non-combatants during war, such as nuclear, chemical and biological threats; the second, to 
the challenges of economic insecurity and inequity, access to food, water, housing and 
adequate health care, and the elimination of illiteracy.25 
</p>
<p>32. Human security addresses the structural causes of instability and conflict, such as 
poverty, inequality and lack of economic opportunity. Human security requires economic 
development and enhancing social justice.26 According to the Declaration and Programme 
of Action on a Culture of Peace,27 peacebuilding strategies must assure equity in 
development and food security.

</p>
<p> 27 General Assembly resolution 53/243. </p>


<p>33. In the 2005 World Summit Outcome,28 world leaders affirmed their commitment to 
work towards a security consensus based on the recognition that many threats are 
interlinked, that development, peace, security and human rights are mutually reinforcing, 
that no State can best protect itself by acting entirely alone and that all States need an 
effective and efficient collective security system pursuant to the purposes and principles of 
the Charter. 
</p>
<p>34. The objective of lasting and just peaceful coexistence can only be achieved by 
recognizing the human security element of the right to peace.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Individuals have the right to human security, including freedom from fear 
and from want, both being elements of positive peace. This includes the right to an 
adequate standard of living, including adequate food, water, housing, health care, education 
and social security. 
</p>
<p> 2. All peoples and individuals have the right not to be regarded as enemies by 
any State.29 
</p>
<p> 3.  All peoples and individuals have the right to live in an environment that is 
safe and healthy, including an atmosphere that is free from dangerous interference, and to 
be protected against any act or threat of physical or psychological violence, whether 
originating from State or non-State actors. 
</p>
<p> 4. All peoples and individuals have the right to be protected from genocide, war 
crimes, wars of aggression, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. If Member States 
are unable to prevent these crimes from occurring within their own borders, they should call 
on the United Nations to fulfil that responsibility in keeping with the Charter and 
international law.30 
</p>
<p> 5. All peoples and individuals have the right to demand from their Governments 
the effective observance of the norms of international law, international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law.31 
</p>
<p> 6. All peoples and individuals have the right to democratic governance of 
military and related budgets, to an open debate about national and human security needs 
and policies, defence and security budgeting, as well as to accountability of decision 
makers to democratic oversight institutions.32 
</p>
<p><b> D. Resistance to oppression 
</b></p>
<p>35. The preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes that, 
&#8220;whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to 
</p>
<p>  
 28 General Assembly resolution 60/1, para. 72. 
 29 Santiago Declaration on the Human Right to Peace, adopted by the International Congress on the 
</p>
<p>Human Right to Peace, adopted on 10 December 2010 at the World Social Forum on Peace

</p>
<p> 30 General Assembly resolution 60/1, paras. 138-139.  
 31 See Santiago Declaration, art. 3 para. 3.  
 32 Since the 1990s, the Security Council has often expressed the need for a reform of the security sector, 
</p>
<p>including gender issues, in its resolutions. See for example &#8220;Security Council urges security sector 
reform ahead of Central African polls&#8221;, press release, 21 December 2009, and Council resolutions 
1509 (2003), 1833 (2008), 1902 (2009) and 1906 (2009).  </p>


<p>rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule 
of law&#8221;. The General Assembly has affirmed the right of all peoples to resist colonial or 
alien domination.33 
</p>
<p>36. The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations 
and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations 
recognizes the importance of peace to human rights, as well as the realization that &#8220;the 
subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a major 
obstacle to the promotion of international peace and security&#8221;. At the same time, the 
Declaration also recognized that every State &#8220;has the duty to refrain from any forcible 
action which deprives peoples &#8230; of their right to self-determination&#8221; and that peoples 
subjected to such violence have a right to take &#8220;actions against, and resistance to, such 
forcible action in pursuit of the exercise of their right to self-determination&#8221; and to &#8220;seek 
and to receive support as determined by the General Assembly&#8221;.34 
</p>
<p>37. The right to resist and oppose oppression is essential to achieving and maintaining a 
just peace. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1.  All peoples and individuals have the right to resist and oppose oppressive 
colonial or alien domination that constitutes a flagrant violation of their human rights, 
including the right of peoples to self-determination, in accordance with international law. 
</p>
<p> 2.  All individuals have the right to oppose war crimes, genocide, aggression, 
apartheid and crimes against humanity, violations of other universally recognized human 
rights, any propaganda in favour of war or incitement to violence and violations of the 
human right to peace, as defined in the present declaration.35 
</p>
<p><b> E. Peacekeeping 
</b></p>
<p>38. Peacekeeping operations relate to the protection of human rights at least in two 
ways. First, they focus on the physical protection of civilians in post-conflict environments, 
which is a key component of human security. The second way relates to alleged violations 
by peacekeepers and/or associated personnel and their immunity under operational 
command of the United Nations. Local populations should have appropriate avenues for 
making complaints and receiving a response.36  
</p>
<p><b>Proposed standard 
</b></p>
<p> States and the United Nations shall include the comprehensive and effective 
protection of civilians as a priority objective into mandates of peacekeeping operations. 
Peacekeeping missions and peacekeepers shall comply fully with United Nations rules and 
procedures regarding professional conduct, including the lifting of immunity in cases of 
criminal misconduct committed off-duty, to allow local population recourse to legal

investigate effectively comprehensively complaints against members of their national 
contingents. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Right to conscientious objection and freedom of religion and belief 
</b></p>
<p>39. Conscientious objection to military service is recognized by the United Nations, as 
reflected in statements made by the Human Rights Committee and the Commission on 
Human Rights. It derives from the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and 
applies to both conscripts and volunteers. 
</p>
<p>40. The Human Rights Committee has recognized the right of conscientious objection to 
military service as part of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
enshrined in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In its 
general comment No. 22,37 the Committee stated that no discrimination was permitted 
among conscientious objectors on the basis of the nature of their particular beliefs. 
Moreover, it has also addressed the issue in many of its concluding observations on State 
reports and in its cases, most significantly in the case of <i>Yeo-Bum Yoon and Myung-Jin 
Choi v Republic of Korea</i> and thereafter in 11 communications from conscientious 
objectors of different backgrounds in the same country.38 
</p>
<p>41. In its resolution 1995/83, the Commission on Human Rights stated that persons 
performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious 
objections to military service. It also welcomed the fact that some States accept claims of 
conscientious objection as valid without inquiry, and called for independent and impartial 
decision-making bodies where this was not the case.39 The Human Rights Committee 
expressed concern about determinations by military judicial officers in individual cases of 
conscientious objection, and encouraged placing the assessment of applications for 
conscientious objector status under the control of civilian authorities.40 
</p>
<p>42. Furthermore, in its resolution 1998/77, the Commission on Human Rights stated that 
there was a right to object military service on conscientious reasons, as that objection was a 
legitimate expression of the freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and that States 
should refrain from punishing or discriminating against conscientious objectors. 
</p>
<p>43. Regionally, there is also some support for respecting conscientious objection to 
compulsory military service.41 
</p>
<p>44.  Discrimination and violence in the name of religion or belief is at the heart of many 
conflicts based on religious issues, often intertwined with ethnic, national, political or 
historical backgrounds. In its resolution 4/10, the Human Rights Council recognized that 
the disregard for and infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular 
</p>
<p>  
 37 CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, para. 11.  
 38 The Committee identified conscientious objection to military service as a protected form of 
</p>
<p>manifestation of religious belief under article 18(1) of the Covenant, and held that the Republic of 
Korea had violated article 18 by not providing for conscientious objection to military service for these 
two Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. In the other cases, see communications Nos. 1593 to 1603/2007.

para. 4 e. </p>


<p>the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, continued to bring, directly 
or indirectly, wars and great suffering to humankind.  
</p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Individuals have the right to conscientious objection and to be protected in 
the effective exercise of this right. 
</p>
<p> 2. States have the obligation to prevent members of any military or other 
security institution from taking part in wars of aggression or other armed operations, 
whether international or internal, which violate the principles and norms of international 
human rights law or international humanitarian law. Members of any military or other 
security institutions have the right to disobey orders that are manifestly contrary to the 
above-mentioned principles and norms. The duty to obey military superior orders does not 
exempt from the observance of these obligations, and disobedience of such orders shall in 
no case constitute a military offence.42 
</p>
<p> 3.  Individuals have the right to expect that States pay special attention to help 
solve conflicts related to religious and ethnic issues in cooperation with civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human<b> </b>rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination recommended in 
July 2010 that its draft proposal for a possible new international legal instrument regulating 
private military and security companies be carefully considered. The draft of a possible 
convention on private military and security companies defines in article 3 as its scope of 
application States and intergovernmental organizations within the limits of their 
competence with respect to private military and security companies, their activities and 
personnel. It would apply to &#8220;all situations whether or not the situation is defined as an 
armed conflict&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>46. Pursuant to its resolution 15/26, the Human Rights Council has set up an open-ended 
intergovernmental working group to consider the possibility of elaborating an international 
regulatory framework on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of 
private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. States shall refrain from outsourcing inherently State military and security 
functions to private contractors. States shall establish an international regime with clear 
rules regarding the functions, oversight and monitoring of existing private military and 
security agencies. 
</p>
<p> 2. States shall ensure that private military and security companies, their 
personnel and any structures related to their activities perform their respective functions 
under officially enacted laws consistent with international human rights and humanitarian 
law. They shall take such legislative, administrative and other measures as may be 
necessary to ensure that such companies and their personnel are held accountable for 
violations of applicable national or international law. Any responsibility attributable to a 
</p>
<p>  
 42 See Santiago Declaration, art. 5, para. 4.  </p>


<p>private military or security company is independent of and does not eliminate the 
responsibility that a State or States may incur.43 
</p>
<p><b> V. Other dimensions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Peace education 
</b></p>
<p>47. The right to peace is inconceivable without a comprehensive, serious commitment to 
education, both formal and non-formal. Concepts of long-standing historical threats to a 
country, of adversaries and enemies, glorification of violence, racist attitudes towards 
foreigners and even foreign nations and many other perceptions, often misguided by the 
media and political and other interest groups, can profoundly undermine any serious 
attempt to create a culture of peace. Conversely, serious professional education and media 
reporting can greatly enhance a culture of peace and diminish racist, aggressive, 
discriminatory and violent attitudes. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has been very active in this field since the 1970s.  
</p>
<p>48. In 1974, UNESCO adopted its Recommendation concerning Education for 
International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, in which it stressed the importance of education to both 
peace and human rights.  
</p>
<p>49. The Millennium Development Declaration states that human beings must respect 
each other, in all their diversity of belief, culture and language. Differences within and 
between societies should be neither feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset 
of humanity. A culture of peace and dialogue among all civilizations should be actively 
promoted.44 
</p>
<p>50. In its resolution 14/3, the Human Rights Council called upon States and relevant 
United Nations bodies to promote effective implementation of the Declaration and 
Programme on a Culture of Peace. 
</p>
<p>51. Many General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions on the right to 
peace contain provisions supporting peace education.45 
</p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. All peoples and individuals have a right to comprehensive peace education. 
Such education should be the basis of every educational system, generate social processes 
based on trust, solidarity and mutual respect, incorporate a gender perspective, facilitate the 
peaceful settlement of conflicts and lead to a new way of approaching human relationships 
within the framework of a culture of peace.46 
</p>
<p> 2. All peoples and individuals have a right to demand and obtain the 
competences needed to participate in the creative and non-violent resolution or, failing that, 
</p>
<p>  
 43 A/HRC/15/25, annex, art. 5.  
 44 General Assembly resolution 55/2, para. 6.  
 45 For example, General Assembly resolution 53/243A, and Human Rights Council resolutions 8/9, 
</p>
<p>para. 9, 11/4, para. 10, and 14/3, paras. 10-11. 
 46 Santiago Declaration, art. 2, para. 2.  </p>


<p>transformation, of conflicts throughout their life. These competencies should be accessible 
through formal and informal education.47 
</p>
<p> 3. The glorification of violence and its justification shall be prohibited.48 
</p>
<p> 4. All peoples and individuals have the right to have access to access and 
receive information from diverse sources without censorship, in accordance with 
international human rights law, in order to be protected from manipulation in favour of 
warlike or aggressive objectives.49 
</p>
<p> 5. All peoples and individuals have the right to denounce any event that 
threatens or violates the human right to peace, and to freely participate in peaceful political, 
social and cultural activities or initiatives for the defence and promotion of the human right 
to peace, without interference by Governments or the private sector.50 
</p>
<p> 6. States have the obligation:  
</p>
<p> (a) To increase educational efforts to remove hate messages, distortions, 
prejudice and negative bias from textbooks and other educational media, and to ensure the 
basic knowledge and understanding of the world&#8217;s main cultures, civilizations and 
religions; 
</p>
<p> (b) To update and revise educational and cultural policies to reflect a human 
rights-based approach, cultural diversity, intercultural dialogue and sustainable 
development; 
</p>
<p> (c) To revise national laws and policies that are discriminatory against women, 
and adopt legislation that addresses domestic violence, the trafficking of women and girls 
and gender-based violence.51 
</p>
<p><b> B. Development 
</b></p>
<p>52. The right to development addresses many ingredients of a positive peace, such as  
improving the living conditions of the mainstream population, proactive protection of all 
economic, social and cultural rights, and gender-specific support for vulnerable groups. It is 
suggested that it take up selected crucial standards rather than attempting to repeat the long 
list of existing standards developed by relevant United Nations 0rgans and agencies.52 
</p>
<p>53. The Declaration on the Right to Development53 recognizes the interlinked and 
mutually reinforcing character of development and peace, declaring that the elimination of 
</p>
<p>  
 47 Ibid., art. 2, para. 3.  
 48 Ibid., art. 6, para. 2. Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law&#8221; and that &#8220;Any advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited 
by law.&#8221; See also Asian Charter, para. 3.4.  
</p>
<p> 49 Santiago Declaration, art. 8, para. 1.  
 50 Ibid., art. 8, para. 2.  
 51 A/63/127, para. 66.  
 52 For example, the Working Group on the Right to Development, the high-level task force on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to development, special procedures mandate holders, such as the Special 
Rapporteurs on the right to food and on foreign debt, and the work of United Nations agencies such as 
the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, 
the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund.  
</p>
<p> 53 General Assembly resolution 41/128, annex.  </p>


<p>threats of war would contribute to the establishment of circumstances propitious to 
development, and that international peace and security are essential elements for the 
realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, States should take steps to eliminate obstacles to development 
resulting from failure to observe civil and political and economic, social and cultural rights, 
and should use resources freed by disarmament for comprehensive development.54 
</p>
<p>55. In 1999, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration and Programme of Action 
on a Culture of Peace,55 which served as the basis for the International Year for the Culture 
of Peace and the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the 
Children of the World. Member States were encouraged to take actions to promote a culture 
of peace at the national level, as well as at the regional and international levels. Civil 
society was to be involved at all levels to widen the scope of activities on a culture of 
peace. 
</p>
<p>56. The Millennium Development Declaration contains various references to peace as 
an important objective of the United Nations. In particular, section II emphasizes the nexus 
between peace, security and disarmament as well as between human rights, democracy and 
good governance. In the Declaration, Member States agreed to ensure greater policy 
coherence and better cooperation between the United Nations, its agencies, the Bretton 
Woods Institutions and the World Trade Organization, as well as other multilateral bodies, 
with a view to achieving a fully coordinated approach to the problems of peace and 
development.56 This corresponds to Millennium Development Goal targets 8 B and C, 
which demands that States deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing 
countries through national and international measures. Furthermore, States undertook the 
obligation to develop an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and 
financial system that includes a commitment to good governance, development and poverty 
reduction &#8211; both nationally and internationally.57<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Peoples and individuals have a right to State policies that pursue peace and 
security and development as interlinked and mutually reinforcing, and as serving as a basis 
for one another. The obligation to promote comprehensive and sustainable economic, 
social, cultural and political development implies the obligation to eliminate threats of war 
and, to that end, to strive towards disarmament, and the free and meaningful participation of 
the entire population in this process. 
</p>
<p> 2. The realization of the human right to peace and the eradication of structural 
violence require that all individuals and peoples enjoy the inalienable right to participate in 
economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms may be fully exercised, as well as to contribute to and enjoy that 
development.58 
</p>
<p> 3. All peoples and individuals should enjoy freedom from want in order to live 
in peace. They should enjoy the right to sustainable development and economic, social and 
cultural rights and, in particular: 
</p>
<p>  
 54 Ibid., arts. 3 (3) and 7.  
 55 General Assembly resolution 53/243 (1999).  
 56 General Assembly resolution 55/2, sect. VIII.  
 57 Ibid., paras. 13 and 16.  
 58 Santiago Declaration, art. 4, para. 1.  </p>


<p> (a) The right to food, drinking water, sanitation, health, clothing, housing, 
education and culture; 
</p>
<p> (b) The right to work and to enjoy fair conditions of employment and trade union 
association; the right to equal remuneration among persons who perform the same 
occupation or function; the right to have access to social services on equal terms; and the 
right to leisure.59 
</p>
<p> 4. All peoples and individuals have the right to the elimination of obstacles to 
the realization of the right to development, such as the servicing of unjust or unsustainable 
foreign debt burdens and their conditionalities, or the maintenance of an unfair international 
economic order, because they generate poverty and social exclusion. States and the United 
Nations system shall fully cooperate in order to remove such obstacles, both internationally 
and domestically.60 
</p>
<p><b> C. The environment, in particular climate change 
</b></p>
<p>57. The environment is a crucial aspect of the right to peace. An area of particular 
relevance is climate change.61 
</p>
<p>58. Climate change has a negative impact on a variety of human rights, ranging from the 
right to life, food, water, health, housing and shelter through to the right to self-
determination of peoples and rights relating to livelihood and culture, migration and 
resettlement and personal security in cases of conflict.62 Furthermore, the historical 
contribution to and the share of the burden caused by climate change are distributed highly 
unevenly.63 Adaptation and mitigation policies and long-term protection, however, may 
also have adverse effects.64 
</p>
<p>59. In 2008, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/23, requested OHCHR to 
undertake a study on human rights and climate change. The study65 was presented in 2009 
and deals with, inter alia, the impact of climate change-induced displacement and conflict. 
It also analyses the consequences of climate change on relevant obligations under 
international human rights law. According to the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, 
land degradation has prompted, together with other factors, fights over resources in the 
conflict in the Darfur region of the Sudan and in other conflicts in Africa.66 The non-
governmental organization Alert International has identified 46 countries with a high risk of 
armed conflict owing to climate change and 56 States threatened by political instability.67 
</p>
<p>  
 59 Ibid., art. 3, para. 4.  
 60 Ibid., art. 4, para. 2.  
 61 The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change defines climate change or &#8220;global 
</p>
<p>warming&#8221; as &#8220;a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that 
alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability 
observed over comparable time periods&#8221; (art. 1, para. 2).

 </p>


<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1.  All peoples and individuals have the right to live in an environment that is 
safe and healthy, including an atmosphere that is free from dangerous man-made 
interference, and to be protected against any act or threat of physical or psychological 
violence, whether originating from State or non-State actors. 
</p>
<p> 2. All peoples and individuals have the right to be protected from genocide, war 
crimes, ethnic cleansing, crimes of aggression and crimes against humanity.68 
</p>
<p> 3.  States affirm that the adverse impacts of man-made climate change interfere 
with the enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, and 
thereby threaten domestic and international development, stability, peace and security. 
Consequently, States must assume responsibility for mitigating climate change based on the 
best available scientific evidence and their historical contribution to climate change in order 
to ensure that all people have the ability to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, 
particularly those interfering with human rights. 
</p>
<p> 4. All peoples and individuals have a human right to participate in sustainable 
development and the implementation of policies to mitigate and adapt to environmental 
destruction, especially climate change, and free and meaningful participation in the 
development and implementation of such mitigation and adaptation policies. 
</p>
<p> 5.  All States shall be held responsible for the environmental impact of war, 
including environmental modifications, whether deliberate or unintentional, that result in 
long-lasting or severe effects, cause lasting destruction, damage or injury to another State.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Victims and vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>60. All individuals share the same human dignity and have an equal right to protection. 
Nevertheless, there are certain groups with specific vulnerability who deserve special 
protection. These include women in particular situations, children, victims of enforced or 
involuntary disappearance, disabled, elderly and displaced persons, migrants, refugees and 
indigenous peoples, and minorities stereotyped with endangering national security. 
</p>
<p>61. In 2000, in its resolution 1325 (2000), the Security Council recognized for the first 
time the strong link between women, peace and security, and stressed the need to address 
gender-based violence and gender inequality in conflict and post-conflict situations, and the 
importance of women&#8217;s equal participation in all efforts to maintain and promote 
sustainable and just peace and security. States obligations include protection of women and 
girls from rape, forced pregnancy, and the use of women as instruments of war and sexual 
slavery. Security Council resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009) introduced new 
approaches to integrate gender into all aspects of peace and security. 
</p>
<p>62.  When looking at individuals and groups that are particularly vulnerable to violence 
and armed conflict, it is clearly visible that those individuals and groups have previously 
experienced, in many cases, discrimination, exclusion and marginalization in political, 
social, economic or other ways. States should be aware of this connection and consequently 
perceive the fight against discrimination as one preventive measure against the breakout 
and deterioration of violence and armed conflict, allowing all individuals, groups and 
peoples to enjoy their right to peace.

<p> 68 General Assembly resolution 60/1, paras. 138-139.  </p>


<p>63. All victims of human rights violations have a right to remedy, non-repetition and 
accountability of perpetrators,69 as well as the right to recognition of their status as victims, 
without discrimination.70 On the rights of victims particularly vulnerable and their right to 
remedies, the Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 31 on the nature of the 
general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, advocated for such remedies being appropriately adapted so as to take 
account of the special vulnerability of certain categories of person, including, in particular, 
children.71 
</p>
<p>64. With regard to the past of an armed conflict or national emergency situation, 
mechanisms such as truth commissions have proven to be useful means to achieve peace in 
post-conflict societies and to ensure that the rights of victims are protected. Another second 
important issue is the right to compensation, which includes not only financial reparation, 
but also acknowledgment of past violations or accountability for perpetrators. The right to 
participate in such processes is important and all groups need to be included. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposed standards 
</b></p>
<p> 1. States shall ensure that the specific effects of the different forms of violence 
on the enjoyment of the rights of persons belonging to groups in situations of vulnerability 
are taken fully into account. They have the obligation to ensure that remedial measures are 
taken, including the recognition of the right of persons belonging to groups in situations of 
vulnerability to participate in the adoption of such measures.72 
</p>
<p> 2. Every victim of a human rights violation has the right, in accordance with 
international human rights law, to the restoration of the violated rights; to obtain effective 
and complete redress, including the right to rehabilitation and compensation; to measures of 
symbolic redress or reparation; and to guarantees that the violation will not be repeated.73 
</p>
<p> 3. States, international organizations, in particular the United Nations, and civil 
society shall facilitate the specific contribution of women to the prevention, management 
and peaceful settlement of disputes, and promote their contribution to building, 
consolidating and maintaining peace after conflicts. To this end, the increased 
representation of women shall be promoted at all levels of decision-making in national, 
regional and international institutions and mechanisms in these areas.  
</p>
<p> 4. All individuals and peoples subjected to aggression, genocide, racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and other related forms of intolerance or apartheid, colonialism 
and neo-colonialism deserve special attention as victims of violations of the human right to 
peace.74 
</p>

<p><b> VI. Obligations of States  
</b></p>
<p>65. According to the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally 
Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission, States that have committed an 
internationally wrongful act are liable to make reparation for any injury, whether it be 
material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.75 Such an 
internationally wrongful act (action or omission) must be attributable to the State and 
further constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State.76 Clearly, such 
obligations arise through a number of treaties and conventions as well as customary 
international law on the topic, referring both to peace and war times.77 
</p>
<p>66. The Santiago Declaration reflects the obligations of States. Article 13 provides that:  
</p>
<p>(a)  The effective and practical realization of the human right to peace necessarily entails 
duties and obligations for States, international organizations, civil society, peoples, 
individuals, corporations the media and other actors in society and, in general, the entire 
international community;  
</p>
<p>(b)  The fundamental responsibility for preserving peace and protecting the human right 
to peace lies with the States and also with the United Nations as the most universal body 
harmonizing the concerted efforts of nations to realize the purposes and principles 
proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations;  
</p>
<p>(c)  States should take all the necessary measures to ensure the development and 
protection of the environment, including disaster preparedness strategies, as their absence 
poses a threat to peace, and have the obligation to cooperate in all necessary fields in order 
to achieve the realization of the human right to peace, in particular by implementing their 
existing commitments to promote and provide increased resources to international 
cooperation for development; 
</p>
<p>(d)  States are also required to take measures to build and consolidate peace, and have 
the responsibility to protect humankind from the scourge of war. This, however, should not 
be interpreted to imply for any State any entitlement to intervene in the territory of other 
States;  
</p>
<p>(e) To guarantee the human right to peace, Member States are called on to strive for 
reform of the Security Council in order to reflect and better ensure a fair and balanced 
representation of today&#8217;s international community. The methods of work of the Security 
Council must be transparent and allow civil society and other actors to participate in its 
debates. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Monitoring and implementation 
</b></p>
<p>67. Three new mechanisms have been proposed. 
</p>
<p>  
 75 General Assembly resolution 56/83, annex, art. 31.  
 76 Ibid., art. 2.  
 77 For example, the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, the obligations of the Rio Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Environment and Development, principles 2, 14, 18, 19 and 24, and Additional Protocol I to the 1949 
Geneva Conventions, articles 55 and 56.  </p>


<p><i>  A new special procedure 
</i></p>
<p>68. At the expert workshop on the right of peoples to peace, convened by OHCHR in 
Geneva on 15 and 16 December 2009, an expert suggested creating the mandate of Special 
Rapporteurs or independent expert on the right to peace.78 
</p>
<p><i>  A new working group  
</i></p>
<p>69. The Spanish Society for the Advancement of Human Rights Law suggested setting 
up a working group as a monitoring mechanism. The Santiago Declaration mentions in 
article 15 a working group on the human right to peace, which would be composed of 10 
members, with the functions of promoting the observance and implementation of the 
Declaration. In its mandate, the working group would have the competences (a) to promote 
worldwide observance and awareness of the human right to peace; (b) to gather, assemble 
and respond effectively to any relevant information from States, international organizations 
and their organs, civil society organizations, national human rights institutions, concerned 
individuals and any other reliable source; (c) to carry out <i>in loco</i> investigations concerning 
violations of the human right to peace and to report to the pertinent bodies; (d) to address 
recommendations, appeals and urgent actions to the States Members of the United Nations, 
requesting them to take appropriate measures for the effective realization of the human 
right to peace, giving due consideration to those recommendations and appeals; (e) to draw 
up, on its own initiative or at the request of the General Assembly, the Security Council or 
the Human Rights Council, the reports it deems necessary in the event of an imminent 
threat to or serious violation of the human right to peace; (f) to present an annual report of 
its activities to the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council; 
(g) to contribute to the elaboration of definitions and norms concerning the crime of 
aggression and the limits of legitimate self-defence; and (h) to submit to the Prosecutor of 
the International Criminal Court or other competent international criminal tribunals reliable 
information about any situation in which it would appear that crimes falling within the 
jurisdiction of the Court or of another international criminal tribunal have been committed. 
</p>
<p><i>  A new open-ended working group 
</i></p>
<p>70. At the above-mentioned expert workshop, one expert suggested an open-ended 
working group of Member States, open to the participation of civil society organizations.79 
</p>
<p>71. The Advisory Committee does not recommend a specific mechanism at this time, 
electing rather to await comments and proposals arising from the discussion. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The present report proposes more than 40 possible standards for inclusion in 
the draft declaration on the human right of peoples to peace, specific rationale for 
including them and relevant legal standards. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>After its sixth session, </b>t<b>he Advisory Committee invited stakeholders to 
comment on the present report in a questionnaire, as is the custom in all study 
projects. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In the light of discussions held by the Human Rights Council and of responses 
from stakeholders, at its upcoming meetings the Advisory Committee will work on a

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Some pointers on concepts of peace 
</b></p>
<p>This appendix intends to give a brief overview over different dimensions and approaches on 
peace and a right thereof.  
</p>
<p>It mainly focuses on who may be right holders and duty bearers, whether a right to peace 
can be perceived as an individual and/or collective right and on the prospect of a 
juridification of a right to peace. Further, it focuses on the relationship of a right to peace to 
other human rights and introduces the notion of human security. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Negative and positive peace 
</b></p>
<p>1. A key issue, abundantly discussed in academic debate is what constitutes peace or 
absence of peace. Negative peace is often understood to signify the absence of direct, 
physical violence. 
</p>
<p>2. In contrast, the understanding of positive peace goes beyond strict absence of armed 
conflict and is associated with the elimination of all kinds of violence and effective respect 
for all human rights. Only in peaceful environments, the conditions for satisfying the basic 
needs of human beings are met.a Naturally, notions of positive peace differ considerably in 
states and societies over time, but there are certainly some common elements. To give just 
one example, the Kroc Institute of International Peace Studies at the University of Notre 
Dame asserts that &#8216;peace&#8217; within peace studies, 
</p>
<p><b>&#8220;</b>is defined not just as the absence of war (negative peace), but also the presence of 
the conditions for a just and sustainable peace, including access to food and clean 
drinking water, education for women and children, security from physical harm, and 
other inviolable human rights (positive peace). This idea is rooted in the 
understanding that a &#8220;just peace&#8221; is the only sustainable kind of peace; an approach 
that seeks merely to &#8220;stop the guns&#8221; while ignoring the denial of human rights and 
unjust social and political conditions will not work in the long run&#8221;.b 
</p>
<p>3. Another perspective is Johan Galtung&#8217;s approach: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic point is that peace is a relation, between two or more parties. The parties 
may be inside a person, a state or nation, a region or civilization, pulling in different 
directions. Peace is not a property of one party alone, but a property of the relation 
between parties. Saying that in no sense belittles the significance of the party's intent 
and capability to build peaceful relations. But, like a marriage, it is not the sum of 
the capabilities of the parties. Which is why we can have lovely people related in a 
less-than-lovely marriage. And vice versa. 
</p>
<p>What kind of relations can we have? Three types, it seems: 
</p>
<p> (a) Negative, disharmonious: what is bad for one is good for the Other. 
</p>
<p> (b) Indifferent: a non-relation, they do not care about the Other. 
  
</p>
<p> a We just recall here the debate about (structural) violence, use of force, war, right of self-
determination, right of resistance to cite only a few aspects of a complex issue.  
</p>
<p> b The Kroc Institute of International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, &#8220;What is peace 
studies?&#8221;, http://69.5.8.7/node/312, retrieved at 12 Oct 2010.  </p>


<p> (c) Positive, harmonious: what is bad-good for one is bad-good for Other. 
</p>
<p>In the real world relations may be mixes of all three. When the negative relation is 
brought about with intent, the party is an actor, we talk about direct violence, or 
harm, and about war if the actor is collective. If the violence to a party is not 
intended (but watch out for acts of commission, more or less intended!) it maybe 
referred to as indirect, often caused by inequitable structures producing harm - 
structural violence. And then the role of culture legitimizing either or both types of 
violence: cultural violence. 
</p>
<p>From this follow two concepts of peace: 
</p>
<p> (a) Negative Peace: the absence of violence, like a cease-fire, like keeping them 
apart, not negative but indifferent relations. 
</p>
<p> (b) Positive Peace: the presence of harmony, intended or not. They are as 
different as negative health, the absence of (symptoms of) illness and positive health, the 
feeling of wellness and the capacity to handle some illness.&#8221;c 
</p>
<p><b> B. The collective and individual dimension: peoples and individuals should 
be rights holders 
</b></p>
<p>4.  At the OHCHR Workshop (2009) an expert noted that there was a tendency to 
perceive the right to peace primarily from the perspective of collective rights. Yet, he 
argued that peace was also a personal right, prior to and indispensable to other rights. He 
indicated that peace must be seen as an enabling right empowering individuals to enjoy 
civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Moreover, one should not be limited to 
considering peace as the absence of war. Humanity needed to ensure positive peace in the 
form of social justice. He stated that the right to peace must be understood and 
implemented in a holistic manner, among other things, through, respect for civil and 
political rights and must include a focus on the obligations that peace imposes both on 
States and on individuals.d 
</p>
<p>5. Another expert at the workshop noted that the &#8220;right to peace had a definite 
individual dimension, which was assessed through the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&#8221;e 
</p>
<p>6. An expert mentioned that there is a generally accepted principle of dual ownership 
of the human right to peace. He noted that peace was indivisible, and thus manifested itself 
as a collective right of the human community of peoples and States while, at the same time, 
directly affecting each human being as an individual right.f 
</p>
<p>7. Another expert held that the meaning given to the term &#8220;peoples&#8221; for the purposes of 
peoples&#8217; right to peace still remained unclear, leading to an uncertainty as to the rights 
holders. The term &#8220;peoples&#8221; might have different meanings for the purposes of different

<p>rights of peoples. The question was whether the duty bearers were individual States, States 
acting collectively through the United Nations, or the international community as a whole.g 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other collective rights 
</b></p>
<p>8. If one looks at other collective rights, such as the right to development und the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, those clearly include collective as well as 
individual rights. 
</p><p>9. The UN Declaration on the Right to Development (1986)h, for example, states in 
article 1 (a) 
</p>
<p>&#8220;an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples 
are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and 
political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be 
fully realized.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>10. In article 2, it specifies that the human person is the central subject of development 
and should be the active participant and beneficiary of the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The human right to development also implies the full realization of the right of 
peoples to self-determination, which includes, subject to the relevant provisions of 
both International Covenants on Human Rights, the exercise of their inalienable 
right to full sovereignty over all their natural wealth and resources.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>11. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007)i 
combines collective and individual rights: 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 7 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Indigenous individuals have the rights to life, physical and mental integrity, 
liberty and security of person. 
 (b) Indigenous peoples have the collective right to live in freedom, peace and 
security as distinct peoples and shall not be subjected to any act of genocide or any other 
act of violence, including forcibly removing children of the group to another group. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 8 
</b></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation 
or destruction of their culture.  &#8230; 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 17 
</b></p>
<p> (a) Indigenous individuals and peoples have the right to enjoy fully all rights 
established under applicable international and domestic labour law. 
</p>
<p> (b) States shall in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples take 
specific measures to protect indigenous children from economic exploitation and from

<p>performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child&#8217;s education, 
or to be harmful to the child&#8217;s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social 
development, taking into account their special vulnerability and the importance of 
education for their empowerment. 
</p>
<p> (c) Indigenous individuals have the right not to be subjected to any 
discriminatory conditions of labour and, inter alia, employment or salary. 
</p>
<p><b> D. A legal standard, an emerging standard, not yet a human rights 
standard 
</b></p>
<p>12. At the OHCHR Workshop (2009), different opinions were voiced by experts 
whether a right to peace (a) existed, (b) was an emerging right or (c) represented rather an 
aspiration.j For the purpose of this progress report the question of legal status is less 
important. There is a request by the Human Rights Council for a draft declaration, so there 
is obviously a political will to strengthen a soft law standard. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding the question of assertion of peoples&#8217; right before contemporary 
international courts and tribunals, former judge Can&#231;ado Trindade spoke at the OHCHR 
Workshop (2009) about his experience at two such tribunals in which he had served or was 
currently serving as a judge, namely, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the 
International Court of Justice. That experience showed that the rights of peoples had been 
acknowledged and asserted before contemporary international tribunals. It indicated that 
there had been clear advances in the realization of international justice in recent years, in 
cases of factual and evidentiary complexities.k 
</p>
<p><b> E. Relationship of an emerging right to peace to other human rights, 
especially the right to solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>14. At the OHCHR Workshop (2009), an expert suggested that the right to peace could 
be addressed within international human rights law from three perspectives: (1) as part of 
the emerging right to international solidarity; (2) as part of the right of all people and all 
peoples for a democratic and equitable international order; and (3) as an essential element 
of the right of peoples to peace. Thus, in the work of the Human Rights Council the right to 
peace should be linked in its material formulation to emerging rights or solidarity, in 
</p>
<p>  
 j OHCHR Workshop (2009), para  14, 56.  
 k Judge Can&#231;ado Trindade reported: &#8220;The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in the case of the 
</p>
<p><i>Community Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua </i>(2001), had extended protection to the right 
of all the members of an indigenous community to their communal property of their historical lands. Furthermore, three other decisions had had a direct bearing on the rights of peoples, their cultural 
identity and their very survival, namely, in <i>Yakye Axa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay </i>(2005&#8211;
2006), <i>Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay </i>(2005&#8211;2006), as well as in <i>Moiwana 
Community v. Suriname </i>(2005&#8211;2006), which had ruled on the case of the Moiwana massacre. Mr. 
Can&#231;ado Trindade added that such late jurisprudential development would have been unthinkable for 
the draftsmen of the American Convention on Human Rights. Massacres no longer fell into oblivion. 
Atrocities victimizing whole communities, or segments of the population, were being brought before 
contemporary international tribunals, for the establishment not only of the international criminal 
responsibility of individuals, but also of the international responsibility of States&#8221; (OHCHR 2009 
Workshop, para 36).  </p>


<p>particular the right to international solidarity, the right to a democratic and equitable 
international order as well as to the traditional right of peoples to peace.l 
</p>
<p>15. The independent expert on human rights and international solidarity, Rudi 
Muhammad Rizki, has argued in a report that &#8220;some respondents viewed solidarity as a 
principle born together with international human rights law through the pursuit of peace 
among nations. However, it lacks visibility in current human rights instruments because it 
has no binding force. International solidarity is the only way to alleviate poverty, including 
extreme poverty.&#8221; In the context of Third generation rights, and recognizing that solidarity 
rights are Third generation rights, he mentioned, the right to economic and social 
development, the right to participate in and benefit from the &#8220;common heritage of 
mankind&#8221;, the right to peace, the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, the right to 
humanitarian disaster relief and the right to communication.m<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Human security 
</b></p>
<p>16. It is interesting to look at the relationship of a right to peace to human security. The 
concept of human security is of particular relevance here. Since its first appearance in the 
2004 World Development Report of UNDP, a major effort has been undertaken to develop 
the understanding of security beyond the military aspect. Instead with the concept of human 
security, one looks at multi-faceted possible threats against the population. Hence, the 
understanding of security has become much broader and much deeper, which inevitably has 
also given rise to criticism in the academic debate that the concept of human security lacks 
a clear focus and &#8220;borders&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. The General Assembly has asked the Secretary-General to report on progress in the 
area of human security.n His last report on human security emphasized  
</p>
<p> (a)  Broadly defined, human security encompasses freedom from fear, freedom 
from want and freedom to live in dignity. Together, these fundamental freedoms are rooted 
in the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations. They are also reflected in the 
many human security-related initiatives and activities undertaken by United Nations 
agencies, funds and programmes and by intergovernmental organizations as outlined in the 
compendiumo submitted to the General Assembly. &#8230; 
</p>
<p> (b) Calls for such a broader concept of security are rooted in the common issues 
faced by all Governments. No matter how powerful or seemingly insulated Governments 
may be, today&#8217;s global flow of goods, finance and people increase the risks and 
uncertainties confronting the international community. It is in this interconnected 
environment that Governments are invited to consider the survival, livelihood and dignity 
of individuals as the fundamental basis for their security. (&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>18. In the summary of the report, it is noted that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;(h)uman security is based on a fundamental understanding that Governments retain 
the primary role for ensuring the survival, livelihood and dignity of their citizens. It 
is an invaluable tool for assisting Governments in identifying critical and pervasive 
threats to the welfare of their people and the stability of their sovereignty. It

<p>advances programmes and policies that counter and address emerging threats in a 
manner that is contextually relevant and prioritized. This helps Governments and the 
international community to better utilize their resources and to develop strategies 
that strengthen the protection and empowerment framework needed for the 
assurance of human security and the promotion of peace and stability at every level 
&#8211; local, national, regional and international.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>19. Regarding national sovereignty, the document argues that  
</p>
<p> (a) &#8220;the Charter also gives equal weight to the sovereignty of States as well as to 
the livelihood and dignity of people everywhere. As articulated in the preamble and in 
Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter, the international community cannot have peace and security 
unless the rights of individuals and their fundamental freedoms are supported. In this 
context, human security, by addressing the varied aspects of insecurity and by focusing on 
the respective roles of individuals, communities and Governments, provides the analytical 
framework for the creation of genuine possibilities for partnership between Governments 
and citizens. As a result, the application of human security is expected to reinforce the 
stability and security of both, as well as that of the international community.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> (b) &#8220;Common to all the above definitions are three essential components that 
encompass the principles of human security and help further explore the added value of the 
concept. First, human security is in response to current and emerging threats &#8211; threats that 
are multiple, complex and interrelated and can acquire transnational dimensions. Second, 
human security calls for an expanded understanding of security where the protection and 
empowerment of people form the basis and the purpose of security. Third, human security 
does not entail the use of force against the sovereignty of States and aims to integrate the 
goals of freedom from fear, freedom from want and freedom to live in dignity through 
people-centred, comprehensive, context-specific and preventive strategies.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> (c) &#8220;The human security concept derives much of its strength from a dual policy 
framework that rests upon the mutually reinforcing pillars of protection and empowerment. 
Application of this framework offers a comprehensive approach that combines top-down 
norms, processes and institutions, including the establishment of early warning 
mechanisms, good governance and social protection instruments, with a bottom-up focus, 
in which participatory processes support the important role of individuals and communities 
as actors in defining and implementing their essential freedoms. As a result, human security 
not only promotes a framework under which people are protected and empowered, and are 
therefore in a better position to actively prevent and mitigate the impact of insecurities, but 
it also helps in establishing a social contract among various actors in a given society by 
cultivating public discourse, promoting local ownership and strengthening States (&#8230;).&#8221;

<p><b>Annex III  
</b></p>
<p><b>  UNESCO: Brief history of the concept of a culture of peace 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Origin of the concept at UNESCO 
</b></p>
<p>1. The concept of a Culture of Peace arose at the end of the Cold War. For the first 
time, the objective for which the United Nations was founded, the abolition of war, had 
become feasible. The United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture, 
UNESCO, had engaged in activities to promote a Culture of Peace from its beginnings, 
when it was founded in the aftermath of the Second World War to construct the defences of 
peace in the minds of men and women. 
</p>
<p>2. The concept of a Culture of Peace was formulated by the International Congress on 
Peace in the Minds of Men that was held in Africa (Yamoussoukro, C&#244;te d'Ivoire, 1989). In 
its final declaration, the Congress invited &#8220;States, intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations, the scientific, educational and cultural communities of the world, and all 
individuals to &#8220;[...] help construct a new vision of peace by developing a peace culture 
based on the universal values of respect for life, liberty, justice, solidarity, tolerance, human 
rights and equality between men and women.&#8221;a 
</p>
<p>3. The term peace culture was inspired by the 1986 educational initiative Cultura de 
paz in Peru and by the Seville Statement on Violence, elaborated by scientists from around 
the world, which stated scientifically and categorically that war is not determined by genes, 
violent brains, human nature or instincts, but was rather a social invention. Therefore, &#8220;the 
same species that invented war is capable of inventing peace.&#8221; b 
</p>
<p><b> B. National programmes for a culture of peace  
</b></p>
<p>4. In 1992, UNESCO's Executive Board requested a specific programme for a Culture 
of Peace as a contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Reasoning that 
peacekeeping operations alone might assure the absence of war but could not by themselves 
bring a positive, dynamic peace, UNESCO argued in 1992 that this could be done best by 
engaging those who had been in conflict in common ventures of human development. 
Acting primarily in the fields of education, science, culture and communication, UNESCO 
offered its services in post-conflict peace-building. National programmes were undertaken 
in a number of countries of Central America and Africa, as well as in collaboration with the 
Government of the Philippines. 
</p>
<p><b> C. UNESCO's medium term strategy 
</b></p>
<p>5. A major turning point came in 1995 when the General Conference of UNESCO 
dedicated the Organization&#8217;s Medium-Term Strategy for the years 1996 &#8211; 2001 to a Culture 
of Peace. The General Conference stated that

<p>&#8220;the major challenge at the close of the twentieth century is to begin the transition 
from a culture of war to this culture of peace: 
</p>
<p> (a) a culture of social interaction and sharing, based on the principles of freedom, 
justice and democracy, tolerance and solidarity, 
</p>
<p> (b) a culture that rejects violence, endeavours to prevent conflicts by tackling 
their roots and to solve problems through dialogue and negotiation, 
</p>
<p> (c) a culture which guarantees everyone the full exercise of all rights and the 
means to participate fully in the endogenous development of their society.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> D. Transdisciplinary project 
</b></p>
<p>6. UNESCO then established a transdisciplinary project in which its various sectors, 
including education, culture, communication and social science, contributed in a co-
ordinated way to this challenge. 
</p>
<p><b> E. UN General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>7. Recognizing the importance of the UNESCO experience with a Culture of Peace, the 
52nd United Nations General Assembly meeting in the fall of 1997 established a separate 
agenda item entitled &#8220;Towards a Culture of Peace&#8221; and requested the Secretary-General, in 
co-ordination with the UNESCO Director-General, to submit a report on its 
transdisciplinary project along with a draft declaration and programme of action on a 
Culture of Peace. The General Assembly also responded to the recommendation of the 
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and proclaimed the Year 2000 as the 
International Year for the Culture of Peace with UNESCO as the focal point. 
</p>
<p><b> F. The UNESCO Executive Board 
</b></p>
<p>8. Meeting in Tashkent at the invitation of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan 
during its 155th session in November 1998, the UNESCO Executive Board adopted the 
&#8220;Tashkent Declaration for the Culture of Peace and UNESCO&#8217;s Action in Member States&#8221;. 
Aware of the &#8220;great responsibility that will devolve upon UNESCO during the International 
Year for the Culture of Peace&#8221; as well as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace 
and Non-violence for the Children of the World, the Executive Board issued an invitation to 
the Member States, the United Nations System and other intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations to celebrate the Year. It invited them to take &#8220;all necessary 
steps to ensure the success of the Year and thus to affirm the values of tolerance and mutual 
understanding and the values of combating poverty and exclusion, all of which are actions 
that will primarily be of benefit to women, young people and the least developed 
countries.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> G. Beyond the year to a decade 
</b></p>
<p>9. In the fall of 1998, the 53rd General Assembly approved an ECOSOC 
recommendation, based on a proposal coming from all of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, 
to proclaim the decade of 2001 &#8211; 2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace 
and Non-violence for the Children of the World. Thus, the Year 2000 should be seen as a 
new departure towards a long-term process of transformation. </p>


<p><b> H. Declaration and programme of action 
</b></p>
<p>10. Following nine months of debate the UN General Assembly adopted on 13 
September 1999 a &#8220;Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&#8221;.c The first 
article of the declaration provides the most complete definition to date of the Culture of 
Peace:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;A culture of peace is a set of values, attitudes, traditions and modes of behaviour 
and ways of life based on: 
</p>
<p> (a) Respect for life, ending of violence and promotion and practice of non-
violence through education, dialogue and cooperation; 
</p>
<p> (b) Full respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 
independence of States and non-intervention in matters which are essentially within the 
domestic jurisdiction of any State, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and 
international law; 
</p>
<p> (c) Full respect for and promotion of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (d) Commitment to peaceful settlement of conflicts; 
</p>
<p> (e) Efforts to meet the developmental and environmental needs of present and 
future generations; 
</p>
<p> (f) Respect for and promotion of the right to development; 
</p>
<p> (g) Respect for and promotion of equal rights of and opportunities for women 
and men; 
</p>
<p> (h) Respect for and promotion of the rights of everyone to freedom of

<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Asian Human Rights Charter (1998, extract) 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The right to peace 
</b></p>
<p>1. All persons have the right to live in peace so that they can fully develop all their 
capacities, physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual, without being the target of any kind of 
violence. The peoples of Asia have suffered great hardships and tragedies due to wars and 
civil conflicts which have caused many deaths, mutilation of bodies, external or internal 
displacement of persons, break up of families, and in general the denial of any prospects of 
a civilized or peaceful existence. Both the state and civil society have in many countries 
become heavily militarized in which all scores are settled by force and citizens have no 
protection against the intimidation and terror of state or private armies. 
</p>
<p>2.  The duty of the state to maintain law and order should be conducted under strict 
restraint on the use of force in accordance with standards established by the 
international&#8232;community, including humanitarian law. Every individual and group is 
entitled to protection against all forms of state violence, including violence perpetrated by 
its police and military forces. 
</p>
<p>3.  The right to live in peace requires that political, economic or social activities of the 
state, the corporate sector and the civil society should respect the security of all peoples, 
especially of vulnerable groups. People must be ensured security in relation to the natural 
environment they live in, the political, economic and social conditions which permit them 
to satisfy their needs and aspirations without recourse to oppression, exploitation, violence, 
and without detracting from all that is of value in their society.  
</p>
<p>4.  In fighting fascist invasion, colonialism, and neo-colonialism, Asian states played a 
crucial role in creating conditions for their peoples to live in peace. In this fight, they had 
justifiably stressed the importance of national integrity and non-intervention by hegemonic 
powers. However, the demands of national integrity or protection against the threats of 
foreign domination cannot now be used as a pretext for refusing to the people their right to 
personal security and peaceful existence any more than the suppression of people&#8217;s rights 
can be justified as an excuse to attract foreign investments. Neither can they justify any 
refusal to inform the international community about the individual security of its people. 
The right of persons to live in peace can be guaranteed only if the states are accountable to 
the international community.  
</p>
<p>5. The international community of states has been deeply implicated in wars and civil 
conflicts in Asia. Foreign states have used Asian groups as surrogates to wage wars and 
have armed groups and governments engaged in internal conflicts. They have made huge 
profits out of the sale of armaments. The enormous expenditures on arms have diverted 
public revenues from programmes for the development of the country or the well-being of 
the people. Military bases and other establishments (often of foreign powers) have 
threatened the social and physical security of the people who live in their vicinity
