</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraph 9: 
</b></p>
<p>To reflect the second sentence as follows:

</p>
<p>Constitution.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraph 21: 
</b></p>
<p><b>To be expected</b>: The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights (the Ombudsman) is 
</p>
<p>another example of new attention being given to business and human rights issues. <b>The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ombudsman's Annual Reports just from the beginning provide the information on </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.4

</b></p>
<p><b>the activities of the Ombudsman in the field of employment, labor rights, property 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, right to live in healthy environment and in general the activities for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of civil, economic, social and cultural rights. Since its 2013 edition, annual 
</b></p>
<p><b>report of the Ombudsman includes a special secti</b>on on &#8220;Business and human rights&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><b>referring to activities undertaken in this area, including discussions with relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government authorities, the National Confederation of Trade Unions and 
</b></p>
<p>Confederation of Entrepreneurs (Employers&#8217;) Organizations, and ci<b>vil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. Also, in the same year, the Ombudsman facilitated the establishment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a working group composed of relevant State bodies and non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. The Commissioner systematically works towards the implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the </b>&#8220;Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights&#8221;. At the initiative of the 
</p>
<p><b>Ombudsman, this important document was translated into Azerbaijan language by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Ombudsman Office and distributed to the members of the Working Group and 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society organizations. </b> The Working Group welcomes these and other such initiatives 
</p>
<p>that provide a clear opportunity for greater awareness and inclusion of the human rights 
</p>
<p>agenda in national development. 
</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraph 34-36: 
</b></p>
<p>Reference is made in these paragraphs to the information that representatives of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, human rights defenders, and journalists have suffered harassment, 
</p>
<p>intimidation or arrest.  
</p>
<p>In connection with this it should be taken into account that wide opportunities for 
</p>
<p>independent work are created for human rights defenders, representatives of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations operating in the Republic of Azerbaijan in various spheres as well as mass 
</p>
<p>media, the full amount of their rights and freedoms are guaranteed, they are not subjected to 
</p>
<p>harassment, intimidation and criminal prosecution in connection with their activity. Only 
</p>
<p>persons suspected of a specific crime shall be prosecuted in the manner prescribed by law 
</p>
<p>and, in this case, regardless of official position, belief, belonging to political parties, trade 
</p>
<p>unions and other public associations, and other circumstances the principle of equality of all 
</p>
<p>before law is fundamental.  
</p>
<p>It should be noted for information that there is a stable system of partnership relations 
</p>
<p>between the government agencies and NGOs in our country. As an example it is possible to 
</p>
<p>show the Public Committee that has been carrying out the public control over Penitentiary 
</p>
<p>system for a long period of time and whose members are representatives of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, human rights defenders.   
</p>
<p> At the same time the Law &#8220;On public participation&#8221; which is directed to the participation 
</p>
<p>of citizens in governing of the state and carry out the public control over the activities of 
</p>
<p>state bodies entered into force in June 2014. Authorities of the Public Committee have been 
</p>
<p>expanded in relation with this Law; members of the Committee take an active part in 
</p>
<p>different spheres of justice activity. 
</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraph 37 </b>(Activity of the Joint Working Group on human rights issues)<b>: 
</b></p>
<p>Activity of the Joint Working Group on human rights issues was restored in October 2014 
</p>
<p>by the initiative of the head of the state and  the Secretary General of the Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>(before this the Group was operated in 2005-2008). Representatives of state bodies and 
</p>
<p>NGOs operating in the field of human rights protection conduct joint consultations and 
</p>
<p>discussions under open and constructive dialogue; give recommendations to the agencies 
</p>
<p>that have authority to make a decision related to the cases of persons whose rights have 
</p>
<p>been probably violated.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>Activity of the group is recognized as a valuable and reliable mechanism for the dialogue, 
</p>
<p>this group is a unique model for other European countries.   
</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraph 38-40 </b>(Several civil society organizations operating in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights face difficulties with registration, their bank account are frozen, they suspend their 
</p>
<p>activity)<b>: 
</b></p>
<p>The analysis of the activity of non-governmental organizations shows that the development 
</p>
<p>of civil society institutions is the focus of attention in our country. According to the 
</p>
<p>indicators of 2014, 3021 non-governmental organization were registered (more than 315 are 
</p>
<p>operating in the field of human rights). According to the current legislation non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations can operate without registration.    
</p>
<p>It should be noted that, according to the Presidential Decree dated November 20, 2013, 
</p>
<p>which plays an important role in providing electronic services for NGOs, Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice established &quot;Individual electronic window&quot; electronic information system. This 
</p>
<p>system has been put into operation.  
</p>
<p>&quot;Individual electronic window&quot; is the information system which provides mutual exchange 
</p>
<p>of information between NGOs with government agencies, issuance of information 
</p>
<p>determined by law and reports in electronic form, and other electronic services. This system 
</p>
<p>covers the creation of &quot;personal electronic cabinet&quot; for NGOs, receiving and responding of 
</p>
<p>the documents in electronic form related to their activities, electronic registration of 
</p>
<p>documents related to allocation and giving grants as well as other functions.  
</p>
<p>It should be noted that on the basis of proposals prepared by taking into consideration the 
</p>
<p>decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and  recommendations of the European 
</p>
<p>Commission for Democracy through Law of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission) 
</p>
<p>amendments were made to Laws &#8220;on Non-governmental organizations (social unions and 
</p>
<p>foundations)&#8221;, &#8220;on State registration and state registry of legal persons&#8221;, &#8220;on Grants&#8221;, &#8220;on 
</p>
<p>Fight against legalization of money or other property obtained through criminal activity and 
</p>
<p>terrorism financing&#8221;, as well as the Administrative Offences Code in November 17, 2013.  
</p>
<p>Issues of the appeal to the court on suspension of the activity of NGOs by their members 
</p>
<p>whose rights are violated, relating the branches and representative offices of foreign NGOs 
</p>
<p>to monitoring entities on money laundering, involvement of NGOs to the study of the 
</p>
<p>activities of NGOs, inadmissibility the implementation of activity on the basis of 
</p>
<p>unregistered changes in the state registry of legal entities have been reflected within the 
</p>
<p>framework of these amendments.  
</p>
<p>Also the main purpose of the changes to legislation made in October 17, 2014 was 
</p>
<p>elimination of gaps in legislation related to financing of NGOs, strengthening the national 
</p>
<p>donor institutions, to assist grant allocated by donors in directing to the real needs, and to 
</p>
<p>increase transparency in the process of using the funds received from foreign sources.  
</p>
<p>Currently, the work is being carried out on improvement of legislation regulating the 
</p>
<p>registration of contracts on reception of grants. In this regard, the Ministry of Justice has 
</p>
<p>prepared the projects and submitted to the relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p>Public discussions were held in 2014 in relation with all amendments made to the Laws &#8220;on 
</p>
<p>Non-governmental organizations (social unions and foundations)&#8221;, &#8220;on State registration 
</p>
<p>and state registry of legal persons&#8221;, &#8220;on Grants&#8221; with the view of improvement of 
</p>
<p>legislation in sphere of NGO. 
</p>
<p>It should be taken into account that according to the Article 16.4 of the Law &#8220;on Non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (social unions and foundations)&#8221; non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and the branches and representative offices of foreign non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations can apply to the relevant executive body in connection with the temporary </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>suspension of their activities. Based on this article, organizations are able to suspend their 
</p>
<p>activities voluntary in any time. The cases of the suspension the activities of organizations 
</p>
<p>are not related with the amendments to the legislation.   
</p>
<p>Also according to the legislation the Ministry of Justice does not have authority to freeze 
</p>
<p>bank accounts of the organizations.   
</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraph 48: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8230; Also, the establishment in 2012 of the &#8220;Azerbaijani Service and Assessment Network&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(ASAN Service) that provides citizens with access to a range of public and private services 
</p>
<p>through dedicated ASAN Service centres and mobile ASAN buses, was a result of 
</p>
<p>comprehensive reforms in Azerbaijan aimed at the total eradication of petty corruption 
</p>
<p>across the public administration and at ensuring the transparent and efficient delivery of 
</p>
<p>public services to the citizens. 
</p>
<p><b>  As to paragraphs 72-80: 
</b></p>
<p>Currently, a half of women in Azerbaijan are in salaried employment and disparity between 
</p>
<p>the incomes of men and women are likely to continue to decrease in the near term. 
</p>
<p>According to official statistics, the number of paid workers in Azerbaijan as of January 1, 
</p>
<p>2014 is 1.514 mln. persons.   
</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects for creation of the Electronic Information System (EIS) 
</p>
<p>under &#8220;E-Government Portal&#8221; is to ensure the signing of labor contract between the 
</p>
<p>employer and employee, unidentified as being involved in to illegal labor relations. 
</p>
<p>As of April 2015, 1.270 mln. labor contract notifications were registered. 
</p>
<p>Given the above, we would like to notify that there is no data on illegal employment in the 
</p>
<p>official statistics of the country. 
</p>
<p>With regards to the paragraph 1 of the &#8220;E. Labor Rights&#8221; section of the report we would 
</p>
<p>like to inform that in accordance with the Article 16 of the Labor Code of the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan, enacted on June 1, 1999 no discrimination among staff members is allowed in 
</p>
<p>labor relations based on citizenship, gender, race, religion, place of living, property status, 
</p>
<p>public-social origin, age, family status, beliefs, political views, participation in trade unions 
</p>
<p>or any other public unions, service status,, as well as business qualities of a staff member, 
</p>
<p>professional qualifications or any other factors not related to results of labor, as well as 
</p>
<p>direct or indirect concessions and privileges and limitation of rights on such grounds are 
</p>
<p>strictly prohibited. Any employer or a private individual allowing for such discrimination in 
</p>
<p>the process of labor relations as indicated in the article is subject to account envisaged by 
</p>
<p>the legislation. Staff member, whose rights had been violated may claim rehabilitation of 
</p>
<p>rights through court. 
</p>
<p>Convention No.100 &#8220;On Equal Remuneration for Men and Women&#8221;, No.111 &#8220;On 
</p>
<p>Discrimination in the Field of Labor and Employment&#8221; play an important role in the row of 
</p>
<p>ILO documents. Reports on implementation of relevant liabilities, emerging from such 
</p>
<p>international documents are regularly being developed and submitted to relevant 
</p>
<p>international organizations. 
</p>
<p>In accordance to the Law on &#8220;Living Minimum&#8221; for the purpose of defining the targeted 
</p>
<p>social assistance the criteria of needs for 2015 was approved at the level of 105 manat. 
</p>
<p>Currently the national minimal wage is 105 manat. 
</p>
<p>The criterion of needs for the country is the criterion, renewed every year  along with the 
</p>
<p>state budget, to define the targeted social assistance for main social-demographic groups 
</p>
<p>based on the minimum living standard. </p>

<p><b>  As to paragraph 85:  
</b></p>
<p>To be expected: As the Working Group learned from its meeting with the Ombudsman, in 
</p>
<p>2013 the institution, including four regional centers, received 13,670 appeals. 75,8 % of 
</p>
<p>them were complaints and 24,2 % appeals. 52,4% of complaints could not be examined 
</p>
<p>according to the Constitutional Law, which states that if a complaint is out of the

<p>Commissioner&#8217;s competence and more than a year has passed since the date when the case 
</p>
<p>of human rights violation occurred; a complaint is anonymous; a complaint is being 
</p>
<p>examined within court proceedings; repeatedly submitted petitions does not contain any 
</p>
<p>new information, fact and evidence. 47,6% of the complaints were accepted for 
</p>
<p>examination and 65,5% of them were resolved. The complaints dealing with violations of 
</p>
<p>civil, economic and social rights typically concerned delivery of ID cards, registration, 
</p>
<p>responding to information queries, plots of land, property, apartment, also damages caused 
</p>
<p>by natural disasters, pensions and allowances, targeted social aids, restoration at the work

<p><b>As stated in the Constitutional Law, Ombudsman is not powered to handle complaints

</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner has closely cooperated with the competent state authorities in order to
