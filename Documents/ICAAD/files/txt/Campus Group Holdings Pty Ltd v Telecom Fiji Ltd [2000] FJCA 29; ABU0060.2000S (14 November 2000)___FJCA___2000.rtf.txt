DECISION

The only explanation for the delay by the applicant - negotiation to settle - I find that the respondents position was clear as far back as April that they would, not settle unless full purchase price was paid on settlement. When the offer was clarified beyond doubt the applicant did not make application for extension. The applicant has not satisfactory explained delay.

As to the merits, the applicant simply relies on the argument that there are important questions. This does not go for enough to demonstrate an arguable case.

I dismiss the application.

Costs of this application to the respondent.
