</i></p>
<p><i>      The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, visited 
Mexico from 8 to 18 February 2010. During the visit he examined the situation of the right 
to education in terms of the different types and levels of education: preschool, primary, 
secondary and upper secondary, and higher education. 
</i></p>
<p><i> 
      In the present report the Special Rapporteur analyzes the main features of Mexico&#8217;s 
enrolment and non-enrolment education system in terms of organization, coverage, State 
spending and scholarships, and the recent reforms introduced by the Federal Government 
currently in office. 
 
      The Special Rapporteur was also able to study the steps taken by the Government to 
tackle the challenges faced by the education system, chiefly with respect to the quality of 
education, indigenous education, intercultural education, education for migrant and child 
day labourers, and comprehensive education.

<i>      The Special Rapporteur points in conclusion to the need to secure a national consensus 
on education which will far outlive changes of Government and which involves various 
actors from civil society: parents; the academic world; civil society organizations; 
students; teachers; and federal and state authorities.

<p><b>II. The right to education: principles, rules and standards 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. International legal framework</b> 
 
3. The United Mexican States is a party to international human rights instruments, 
including: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (acceded in 1981); the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1981); the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1986); 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(1975); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(1981); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990); the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities (2007); the Protocol on the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea 
or Air and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children additional to the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (2003); and the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of the 
International Labour Organization (No. 169 of 1989) (ratified in 1990). All these 
instruments contain specific provisions on education and commit States to adopt all 
necessary measures to protect, respect and facilitate the exercise of the right to education of 
all persons in their territories without any discrimination whatsoever. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Domestic legal framework and federal and state policies</b> 
 
4. Mexico&#8217;s two principal legal instruments regulating education are the Constitution of 
the United Mexican States of 1917 and the General Education Act (<i>Diario Oficial de la 
Federaci&#243;n</i> (DOF) of 13 July 1993). 
 
5. Article 3 of the Constitution provides that education is a right of every individual. The 
State, including the Federation, the federal entities, the Federal District and the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.4

</b> 
</p>
<p>municipalities, are required to provide preschool, primary and secondary education, the 
components of compulsory basic education in Mexico. 
</p><p> 
6. The Mexican State has adopted the necessary legislative and regulatory measures for 
creating an education system which seeks to guarantee the exercise of the right to 
education. In general terms, the regulatory framework is governed by the articles of the 
Constitution which refer to educational matters and by the General Education Act. 
 
7. The Constitution provides at the outset that &#8220;every person has the right to receive 
education&#8221; and stipulates that the State shall provide compulsory basic education consisting 
of preschool, primary and secondary education. This education must be &#8220;secular&#8221; and 
&#8220;free&#8221; when provided by the State. The Constitution goes on to state that &#8220;the guiding 
principle of this education shall be based on the achievements of scientific progress, shall 
fight ignorance and its effects, servitude, fanaticism and prejudice&#8221;: a &#8220;democratic&#8221; and 
&#8220;national&#8221; principle.1 The authorities are required to improve literacy levels among the 
indigenous peoples and communities in order to overcome their deficits and backwardness, 
as well as promoting bilingual and intercultural education, the completion of basic 
education, industrial training, and upper secondary and higher education.2 To this end the 
Constitution provides that the authorities shall &#8220;formulate and carry out education 
programmes with a regional content which recognize the cultural heritage of [Mexico&#8217;s] 
peoples, in accordance with the relevant legislation and in consultation with the indigenous 
communities&#8221;.3 
 
8. The General Education Act, adopted in 1993 and amended in 2009, &#8220;regulates the 
education provided by the State: by the Federation, the federal entities and the 
municipalities, their decentralized bodies, and individuals officially authorized or 
recognized as qualified to teach. It is binding throughout the Republic, and its provisions 
are provisions of public policy and social benefit&#8221;.4 The Act states as fundamental 
principles that education is a right inherent in the human person5 and an obligation of the 
State6 and of Mexicans, who must ensure that their minor children and wards attend 
preschool, primary and secondary education establishments.7 The Act provides inter alia 
that the education provided shall be designed &#8220;to contribute to the comprehensive 
development of individuals to enable them to exercise their human capacities to the full&#8221;, as 
well as &#8220;to strengthen the awareness of nationality and sovereignty&#8221; and &#8220;to promote 
through education a knowledge of the Nation&#8217;s linguistic plurality and respect for the 
linguistic rights of the indigenous peoples&#8221;.8 
 
9. Similarly, the federal education authority has exclusive competence to determine for 
the whole Republic the curricula and programmes for preschool, primary and secondary 
education, teacher training and the other forms of training for basic education teachers, to 
produce free textbooks and keep them up to date, and to regulate a national system for the 
education, training and further training of basic education and other teachers and for 
upgrading their qualifications.9 
 
10. Where funding is concerned, the Act provides that the annual amount which the State  
(Federation, federal entities and municipalities) allocates for spending on public education

<p>and the education services must be not less than 8 per cent of the country&#8217;s gross domestic 
product (GDP), and that, within this amount, at least 1 per cent of GDP must be allocated to 
scientific research and technological development in the public institutes of higher 
education.  The Federal Executive and the government of each federal entity are required, 
subject to the applicable provisions on revenue and public spending, to contribute to the 
funding of public education and the education services.10 
 
11. With regard to the Federal District, the General Education Act provides that the powers 
to regulate initial, basic (including indigenous) and special education assigned to local 
education authorities in their respective jurisdictions by article 11 (Application and scope of 
the Act), article 13 (Exclusive competence of local authorities) and article 14 (Shared 
competence of federal and local education authorities), as well as by other provisions of the 
Act, shall be vested in the government of the Federal District and any bodies which it may 
establish. The Federal District has its own legislation: the Federal District Education Act, 
published in the <i>Gaceta Oficial del Distrito Federal</i> on 8 June 2008. This Act requires the 
local government and the Federal District Education Council to collaborate with the Federal 
Executive to verify that the resources allocated to education are used properly.11 The 
government of the Federal District has to work together with the federal authorities to 
improve the public institutions of higher education.12 The Federal District Education 
Secretariat, in turn, is required to keep these institutions under review, without encroaching 
on their jurisdictions, in order to solve any problems which may arise and attend to the 
needs of Mexico City.13 
 
12. The State of Chiapas has had its own education legislation since 1981.14 The purpose 
of this legislation is &#8220;to regulate the education provided by the state, its decentralized 
organs and agencies, and individuals officially authorized or recognized as qualified to 
teach&#8221; in accordance with the principles set out in article 3 of the Federal Constitution, the 
General Education Act, and the Constitution of the State of Chiapas and the principles 
contained therein, as well as with other regulations and agreements.15 
 
13. The State of Nuevo Le&#243;n also has its own Education Act, the latest amended version of 
which was published in the <i>Peri&#243;dico Oficial</i> on 19 December 2008. This Act recognizes 
the right education of all persons on the basis of the principles of equality of 
opportunities,16 secularity,17 free provision,18 equity19 and quality.20 The competent 
authorities for education are the Executive of the State of Nuevo Le&#243;n and the local 
councils of each municipality in the municipal area.21 Nuevo Le&#243;n provides the following 
types and modalities of education: initial, basic, indigenous, adult, special, upper secondary, 
higher, and vocational.22

<p>14. The State of Baja California has had its own Education Act since 29 September 1995. 
The institutions responsible for the education services are the Executive of the State of Baja 
California and the local councils, subject to the relevant powers of the federal education 
authority.23 The Act stipulates the obligation of the Baja California Executive &#8220;to provide 
sufficient education services to enable all the inhabitants to attend preschool, primary and 
secondary education establishments in conformity with the principle of maximum quality 
and equity&#8221;. The Executive must therefore give particular attention to schools in remote 
areas and marginalized urban zones, establish support programmes for teachers working in 
such schools, furnish educational support to groups with special educational needs, 
establish systems of distance learning, etc.24 
 
</p>
<p><b>III. Main features of Mexico&#8217;s education system 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Structure and organization</b> 
 
15. The National Education System (SEN) is based on the national legislation on 
education, and the Ministry of Public Education is the federal lead agency for the System&#8217;s 
policies and operations. The General Education Act provides that the SEN, which is the 
context for all educational activities, consists of: the corps of pupils and teachers and 
education authorities; the National Technical Council on Education and the corresponding 
bodies in the federal entities; the education curricula, programmes, methods and materials; 
the education institutions of the State and its decentralized organs; the private 
establishments officially authorized or recognized as qualified to provide education; and the 
higher education institutions accorded independence under the Act.25 The SEN has four 
funding categories (federal, state, independent and private) and two organizational 
modalities (enrolment and non-enrolment). 
 
</p>
<p><b>1. The enrolment system</b> 
 
<i>(i)  Types of education</i> 
 
 (a) Compulsory basic education 
 
16. There are three levels: preschool, primary and secondary. 
 
17. <b>Preschool education</b> is for children in the 3-5 age group. It has been compulsory by 
law since the 2008/09 school year and thus forms part of the basic education provided by 
the SEN pursuant to transitional article 5 (of the amendment to article 3) of the 
Constitution. There are three modalities: general, indigenous and community. 
 
18. <b>Primary education</b> is for children from age 6 (when they enrol in the first cycle) to 
age 11 (if the pupil has completed regularly the six years of primary education, one cycle 
per year, or up to age 15 if the pupil has enrolled late or has recorded absences or has had to 
repeat grades). There are three modalities: general, indigenous and community. 
 
19. <b>Secondary education</b> generally covers children in the 12-14 age group; it is designed 
to equip them with more advanced knowledge in order to prepare them for the upper

September 1995), art. 1. 
24  Ibid., art. 5. 
25  General Education Act, art. 10. </p>

</b></p>
<p>secondary level or to enter the labour market. There are five modalities: general, technical, 
remote secondary, community, and workers&#8217;.26 
 
 (b) Upper secondary education 
 
20. In upper secondary education the students choose between two paths, depending on 
their personal education plans: the (general or technical) baccalaureate, following which 
they may go on to higher education; or the technical vocational modality, to be followed by 
an occupational option. This level is completed in two or three years, depending on the 
curriculum, and is for students in the 15-17 age group.27 
 
 (c) Higher education 
 
21. Higher education is available in Mexico from age 18, in various forms: institutes of 
technology, technical universities, polytechnic universities, federal public universities, state 
public universities, intercultural universities, and teacher training colleges. Each of these 
types of institution has its own undergraduate and postgraduate programmes (master&#8217;s 
degrees and doctorates).28 
 
<i>(ii)  Types of modality by level of education</i> 
 
22. The <b>general</b> modality caters for most children during their basic and upper secondary 
education. At the preschool and primary levels, children who do not attend general schools 
may enrol in the indigenous or community systems. 
 
23. There are five secondary modalities: general, technical, remote technical, community 
and workers&#8217;. Technical secondary is for pupils who require the knowledge to enable them 
to find jobs quickly. Its curriculum mirrors the general modality but with emphasis on 
technical skills. The remote secondary and community secondary modalities are for 
children living in areas remote from a town. Lastly, there is the workers&#8217; modality, which 
has a very small enrolment.29 
 
24. Upper secondary education also offers options mirroring those of the general modality, 
following the same technical and technological baccalaureate pattern. There are several 
institutions which offer these options, as well as pre-university courses or arrangements for 
leaving the education system and finding a job. As a result, there is a long list of options, a 
situation implying plurality but also the possibility of confusion which may lead to 
curriculum fragmentation. According to the General Education Act, the oversight of 
schools is a matter for the Federal Government and the federal entities. This is why there 
are centralized services of the Federal Government and decentralized services of the 
Federal Government, the federal entities and the states. In addition, the public universities 
(through their independent units) and the private universities officially authorized or 
recognized as qualified to provide education also operate at this level.30 
 
25. There are three types of higher education qualification: teacher training (for basic 
education teachers); university (offering a broad range of disciplines); and technical

<p>(including study for higher technical university degrees). Postgraduate students may be 
awarded special subject, master&#8217;s or doctoral qualifications.31 
 
26. The <b>Directorate General for Indigenous Education</b> is responsible for ensuring that 
the federal entities offer the indigenous population quality initial and basic education based 
on equity in a framework of diversity. 
 
27. The purpose of the <b>General Coordination Office for Intercultural and Bilingual 
Education32</b> is to promote and evaluate education policy in terms of equity, intercultural 
development and social participation in all types and modalities of education in 
coordination with the various agencies of the SEN. To this end it has to produce model 
curricula which take account of diversity, provide specialized training for teaching, 
technical and managerial personnel, develop and disseminate the indigenous languages, 
carry out educational research, and devise alternative forms of school management with 
grass-roots participation. 
 
28. Most of the pupils in the <b>community modality</b> come from indigenous groups or 
sparsely populated settlements remote from the towns, where the SEN offers services which 
differ from the standard model both for cultural reasons and because of the cost of 
providing this kind of education service for very small school populations located far from 
urban areas. The <b>community courses</b> are offered by the <b>National Council for the 
Promotion of Education</b> (CONAFE), unlike the other types of enrolment education 
service, which are provided by the state and federal public education authorities in most of 
the federal entities. 
 
29. CONAFE is the agency of the Federal Government responsible for ensuring that the 
children and young people living in the country&#8217;s poorest and most isolated communities 
have equitable access to education of quality. In locations which have a high degree of 
marginalization but still lack a school CONAFE sponsors community teachers to provide 
education equivalent to the preschool, primary and secondary levels. CONAFE also 
provides education for parents with children aged under four years to train them in good 
child-raising practices. For example, it contributes to the financing of the education of more 
than five million children and young people, whose education is supported by scholarships 
awarded to their families under the Human Development Opportunities Programme run by 
the Ministry of Social Development, which is mentioned later in this report.33 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The non-enrolment system</b> 
 
30. The non-enrolment education system is targeted on persons who wish to continue their 
formal education in more flexible modalities or who have special needs. It includes two 
levels of initial education, adult education, special education, vocational training, an open 
or quasi-school system, and non-enrolment indigenous education. Different types of service 
are provided at every level. 
 
31. The <b>initial education</b> schools take in children even below the age of enrolment in 
preschool education, in part to train their mothers to look after them properly. This type of 
education is provided by the child development centres (CENDI) with funding from the 
federal, state and municipal budgets, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and the 
Social Security and Services Institute for State Employees (ISSSTE). In addition, the 
CONAFE programmes provide initial education services in rural, indigenous and 
marginalized urban areas. Mothers and other members of the community are trained to

<p>carry out activities to promote and enhance mental, social and psychomotor development 
with children aged under four years.34 
 
32. <b>Adult education</b> is provided primarily for persons aged over 15 who have not acquired 
the basic skills of reading, writing and elementary arithmetic or who did not begin or did 
not complete basic education at the correct ages; its curriculum design covers learning to 
read and write and modular courses for primary and secondary certification in subjects of 
use in everyday life and work. Secondary certification enables students to go on to the 
upper secondary level. The <b>National Adult Education Institute</b> (INEA) provides this type 
of education in the form of programmes for young people (from age 15) and/or adults who 
have not acquired the basic skills of reading, writing and counting or who did not begin or 
did not complete their primary and secondary education, and for children and young people 
in the 10-14 age group who are not enrolled in the primary school system, women, 
monolingual indigenous peoples and individuals, street children, inmates of prisons, older 
adults, persons with disabilities, migrant day labourers, and Mexicans who settled in the 
United States of America without beginning or completing their basic education. 
 
33. <b>Special education</b> is for persons with disabilities and is designed to help them to be 
able eventually to enrol in normal schools at the appropriate level. The service can be 
provided for children from 45 days after birth (in the form of initial education), for older 
children (preschool and primary levels) and for adolescents and young people up to age 22 
(secondary education and vocational training). Although the specific modalities may vary 
from state to state, the following are the main special education services: the basic level of 
the Multiple Treatment Centre (CAM-B&#225;sico) &#8211; for the initial, preschool, primary and/or 
secondary education of children and young people with some sign of disability; CAM-
Laboral &#8211; for young people in the 15-22 age group with special educational needs to enable 
them acquire work skills; the Unit for Normal Education Support Services (USAER) &#8211; for 
teachers and the family members of children with some sign of disability enrolled in 
preschool, primary or secondary schools; the Citizens&#8217; Advice Unit (UOP) &#8211; to furnish 
information and advice to the general public concerning various disabilities and the special 
educational needs which they imply.35 
 
34. <b>Training for work</b> is for persons who can at least read and write but need to find jobs 
and require the knowledge and skills used in specific occupations. The training programmes 
in work and specific occupations are run mainly by the General Directorate for Vocational 
Training Centres (DGCFT), which is an agency of the Ministry of Public Education. The 
DGCFT operates with 198 Industrial Training Centres (CECATI) located throughout the 
country and offering a list of 226 courses covering 61 occupations in 17 economic sectors. 
 
35. Lastly, the <b>open or quasi-school education system</b> enables students in upper 
secondary and higher education to study without having to be personally present in the 
classroom. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Coverage</b> 
 
36. Mexico has a net education coverage of 101.4 per cent in primary education (figures 
for the 2007/08 school year),36 which means that practically the entire population has access 
to education at this level. This general pattern is found in most of the federal entities. The

</p>
<p>primary coverage is apparently complete in Baja California Sur, the Federal District, Baja 
California, Morelos and Chiapas, but there are still states, including Quintana Roo, 
Aguascalientes, Yucat&#225;n, Campeche and Colima, where large proportions of children do 
not attend school.37 Estimates based on census figures for the whole country indicate that 
between 1 and 2 per cent of children in the 6-11 age group do not attend school owing to 
the incapacity of the SEN to provide primary schooling in rural, small and isolated 
settlements, to migration for reasons of farm work, or to disabilities suffered by the 
children. 
</p><p> 
37. The net national coverage of secondary education (81.5 per cent) shows a smaller 
uptake than in primary. The Federal District, Coahuila, Baja California Sur, Tlaxcala and 
Morelos are the federal entities with the highest rates of coverage. Federal entities such as 
Chiapas, Guerrero, Campeche, Oaxaca and Michoac&#225;n,38 classified by the National Council 
for Evaluation of Social Policy (CONEVAL) as having high and very high degrees of social 
deficit, have the lowest rates of coverage in secondary education.39 The situation in the 
State of Chiapas is worth analyzing because, as mentioned above, Chiapas is among the 
five states with the highest levels of coverage in primary, but it occupies last place in 
secondary. 
 
38. In the school year 2006/07 the net drop-out rate in primary was 1.5 per cent in the 
public system and 2.1 per cent in the private40 but 7.8 per cent in public secondary and only 
1.9 per cent in private secondary. This means that roughly eight in every hundred children 
in public schools drop-out from public secondary schools and roughly two in every hundred 
drop out from the private system. The enrolment rate with regular grade promotion in the 
2007/08 school year was 82.6 per cent in the 3-5 age group (preschool), 100.2 per cent in 
the 6-11 age group (primary), 87.6 per cent in the 12-14 age group (i.e. for secondary 
students) and 50.4 per cent in the 15-17 age group (when students are normally taking 
upper secondary courses).41 The graduation rate is 99.7 per cent in primary and 90.1 per 
cent in secondary42 (figures for 2006/07). 
 
39. The figure given for the 15-17 age group is particularly relevant, as is the fact that the 
estimated completion rate for 2007/08 was 44.4 per cent.43 There are considerable gaps in 
the coverage in upper secondary education, estimated at 60.1 per cent for that same year, a 
situation which undermines the equity which the education is system should be promoting. 
Although the drop-out rate has been declining, from 17.5 per cent in 2000/01 to 16.6 per 
cent in 2007/08, Mexico is the country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) which reports the least progress in coverage (2006 figures).44 
However, the growth in the provision of education would not be sufficient in itself to 
reverse the negative indicators. Account must be taken of another set of circumstances 
which may cause drop-outs: the inflexibility of the curricula, which are often unsuited to 
the regional and local situations, and the incompatibility of the courses offered in different 
types of establishment. When an upper secondary student is forced to change schools or 
courses, he or she will often have to start again from scratch; this is an off-putting factor 
which, from a broader perspective, has an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the

<p>education system as a whole.45 Furthermore, there are major problems with ensuring the 
quality of the education provided at this level. 
 
</p>
<p><b>C. State spending on education</b> 
 
40. Mexico has increased its spending on education over the past 15 years from 4.1 per 
cent of GDP in 1990 to 6.3 per cent in 2008. In 2008, however, only 4.9 per cent of the total 
was public spending, the remaining 1.4 per cent being private. About 20 per cent of the 
federal budget was allocated to education. 
 
41. Between 2000 and 2007 national expenditure on education per pupil rose at an average 
rate of 7.1 per cent a year to stand at 17,100 pesos at the end of the period; the largest 
increase (11.3 per cent) occurred in 2001 and the smallest (0.6 per cent) in 2006. Although 
the increases in expenditure per pupil by level of education were very small during this 
period, the State at least coped with the increasing enrolment.46 
 
42. The Special Rapporteur was informed that national spending on education in 2010 
would total 6.5 per cent of GDP but that only 78.4 per cent of this forecast amount would 
represent compulsory public spending, with 21.6 per cent coming from private sources; it is 
estimated that in 2009 the federal contribution accounted for 506,706.9 million pesos of 
total national public spending on education and that 114,193.9 million pesos were provided 
by the states and municipalities.47 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. Scholarships and support programmes</b> 
 
43. The Constitution and the General Education Act stipulate that the education provided 
by the State shall be <b>free</b>. 
 
44. In 1997 the Government initiated the Education, Health and Nutrition Programme 
(PROGRESA). Since then this programme has been adopted by three federal 
administrations run by two political parties (the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) 
and the Partido Acci&#243;n Nacional (PAN)), the only difference being the change of name to 
<b>Opportunities</b> in 2002. Although it has undergone changes over the years, from the outset 
this programme has consisted essentially of cash transfers to beneficiary families provided 
that the children attend school and go for regular medical checks. At present the transfers 
under the programme are made every two months to the mothers of participating families, 
which must have children aged under 22 enrolled between the third grade of primary and 
the third grade of upper secondary education. The final amount allocated to a family has 
three components corresponding to the programme&#8217;s three pillars: support for education, 
health and nutrition. 
 
45. In institutional terms Opportunities is run by a national coordination committee, which 
is a decentralized agency of the Ministry of Social Development. Most of its budget is 
provided by this ministry, with additional contributions from the education and health 
ministries, which also determine the operational rules in conjunction with the Treasury and 
the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). The total number of beneficiary families has 
stood at its high point since 2004, representing about 18 per cent of the country&#8217;s 
population and 35 per cent of the poorest quintile.48

</p>
<p>46. Where the education component is concerned, studies and evaluations of Opportunities 
have indicated a positive impact on school attendance figures: &#8220;Estimates of the 
programme&#8217;s impact &#8211; in terms of communities and households &#8211; range between 0.74 and 
1.07 per cent for boys and between 0.96 and 1.45 per cent for girls&#8221;.49 Other studies carried 
out during the programme&#8217;s initial phase also found higher enrolment rates among poor 
children in receipt of the subsidies, with girls again in the lead. It is also worth mentioning 
that Opportunities appears to have a parallel positive influence on child labour, a variable 
not included among the programme&#8217;s objectives. Studies have verified that the probability 
of a child&#8217;s working fell by between 10 and 14 per cent at the moment when he or she was 
enrolled in the programme.50 With regard to higher education, specifically in the 
intercultural universities, students have benefited under the National Higher Education 
Scholarships Programme (PRONABES), the purpose of which is to encourage students 
from poor backgrounds to embark on higher education. In addition, in order to continue 
their studies such students can also obtain scholarships from CONAFE or the municipality 
in which the intercultural university is located. 
 
</p>
<p><b>E. Recent reforms</b> 
 
47. The most recent reform, known as the <b>Alliance for Quality in Education</b> (between the 
Federal Government and the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE)) is a proposal 
put forward in May 2008 with the aim of bringing about change by improving the quality of 
education. 
 
48. This programme seeks to achieve the following changes: modernization of schools (by 
upgrading infrastructure and equipment); advancement and enhancement of qualifications 
for teachers and education authorities (recruiting new personnel by means of national public 
competitions, to be independently organized and judged, by establishing the National 
Further Training System for Upgrading the Qualifications of Serving Teachers, and by 
creating five regional centres of academic excellence); enhancement of the nutritional well-
being and health of pupils and improvements with respect to access to education, retention 
in the system and graduation at the correct age; curriculum reform to ensure the 
comprehensive education of pupils for life and work (by changing the approaches and 
content of basic education and promoting the teaching of English from the preschool level); 
and coordination of the national evaluation system to deliver periodic assessments of the 
stakeholders in the education process.51 Attention should be drawn to three ongoing reforms 
in the education system: chiefly, the reform of basic education; the comprehensive reform 
of upper secondary education; and the incorporation of the intercultural approach in the 
national education system. 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV. Challenges to the education system and steps taken by the 
Government to tackle them</b> 
 
49. Mexico&#8217;s population has increased fourfold over the past 50 years, with the result that 
the demand for education has posed big challenges to the Government and the federal 
entities. The country has not only responded to this situation but has also secured major 
progress in all areas and modalities of education.

</p>
<p><b>15
</b></p>
<p>50. The blooming of an enormous diversity of projects and programmes to meet the 
demand for education has continued right up to the present. In fact, it has been impossible 
to produce an inventory of the enormous diversity of these initiatives. 
</p><p> 
51. The country has about 220,000 basic education schools catering for some 26 million 
children. Great efforts have been made to coordinate the whole of basic education and to 
expand secondary education. In addition, Mexico has a large array of higher education 
establishments in the shape of its universities and technical colleges, which is the envy of 
Latin America. 
 
52. One of the main successes in the building of Mexico&#8217;s institutional capacity was the 
establishment of the National Institute for the Evaluation of Education (INEE), which has 
provided improved information by monitoring a set of indicators on basic and upper 
secondary education and producing in-depth analyses of the educational performance of 
pupils with respect to the national basic education curriculum, as well as studying the 
situation of the supply of education services. All of this activity is designed to facilitate 
decisions on education policy which are more firmly rooted in the national reality. 
 
</p>
<p><b>A. The system&#8217;s complexity</b> 
 
53. Mexico&#8217;s education system is extremely complex in various respects, with its 
characteristic features of a combination of federal and state obligations, decentralization 
and, chiefly, an atypical symbiosis of the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE) 
and the Ministry of Public Education. 
 
54. This symbiosis is due to historical reasons and produces collaboration at some times 
and obstruction at others, but from the standpoint of the obligations of the states with 
respect to right to education it must be stressed that the agency from which this right is 
demanded and which establishes it in legal terms is the Mexican State; this is why the 
SNTE/Ministry mixture exhibits a reciprocal subordination of atypical functions in each of 
the parties which has added great complexity to the education scene. 
 
55. The organic complexity of the administration of education is compounded by 
asymmetrical structures, such as the inequalities between rural and urban areas and between 
public and private schools. The Special Rapporteur was informed that Mexico has five 
million persons aged over 15 years who cannot read or write (8.4 per cent of the total 
population),52 most of them indigenous women and rural dwellers. The illiteracy rate is as 
high as 50 per cent in some areas, and the functional illiteracy rate cannot be estimated; this 
situation has prompted the Government to take serious but still insufficient action. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Education for young people and adults</b> 
 
56. The situation of adult education is worrying, for the official statistics indicate that 30 
per cent of the country&#8217;s total population has an educational deficit. In 2005, 46 per cent of 
persons in the over-15 age group were affected by such a deficit; this means that 31 million 
persons had not completed compulsory basic education or had not attended school.53 This 
figure contrasts sharply with the 66.1 per cent of the population in the 15-64 age group 
living in indigenous households who lack basic education.54

<p><b>16  </b>GE.10-13909 (EXT)<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Despite the seriousness of this deficit among young people and adults, the adult 
education subsystem reaches barely some 2.4 million persons, a fact confirmed to the 
Special Rapporteur by the Director of INEA. Furthermore, it receives  barely 0.86 per cent 
of the budget of the Ministry of Public Education and is in the hands of 100,000 &#8220;<i>asesores 
solidarios</i>&#8221; (support workers), who work part-time with great enthusiasm but have no 
higher teaching qualifications. 
 
</p>
<p><b>C. Education budget</b> 
 
58. The shortage of education funding affects not only Mexico&#8217;s adults but the entire 
education system as well. It is clear that, in spite of the efforts made, the obligation under 
the General Education Act to allocate 8 per cent of GDP to education has still not been 
fulfilled. 
 
59. The shortage of funding has a profound impact in rural areas and indigenous 
communities and is aggravated by the widespread practice of the payment of fees (known 
as &#8220;voluntary contributions&#8221;), which vary in amount and type but affect impoverished 
families more severely. 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. Drop-out and repetition rates</b> 
 
60. Notwithstanding its very good enrolment figures, Mexico is confronted by major 
challenges in the effort to reduce drop-outs and repeated years. 
 
61. According to INEE estimates, for example, only 66 out of every 100 children who 
enrol in primary education complete this level at the correct age;55 the drop-out rate at the 
upper secondary level is about 16 per cent;56 this situation is aggravated by an examination 
system in each state for students completing secondary and entails in practice a selection 
process which often penalizes students who have not had good education opportunities in 
the past. 
 
62. In response to the drop-out problem the education authorities have offered a wide 
variety of scholarships and support programmes to improve retention in the system. 
Nevertheless, rather than contenting itself with the enrolment rates in primary education, 
the State has to continue making determined efforts to ensure success throughout people&#8217;s 
entire education career. It should also be acknowledged that the problem is not simply one 
of funding but is due as well to a lack of cultural and linguistic relevance in education. 
 
</p>
<p><b>E. Teacher training</b> 
 
63. The effort to combat drop-outs and education deficits has revealed a need to continue 
to improve the education and training of teachers, which some national experts describe as 
heterogeneous, irregular and often inconsistent. 
 
64. However, the stock of 266 operational public teacher training schools (including 17 
rural schools) and 225 private teacher training establishments is acceptable, although this 
number satisfies barely 30 per cent of the demand. 
 
65. The teacher training capacity does not measure up to the needs identified, especially in 
rural areas and indigenous communities, which are offered an education service operated by 
extension workers and instructors who have no teaching qualifications and enjoy no

<p>security of tenure and who, in addition, have to deal with groups of pupils in multi-grade 
schools staffed by only one or two teachers. 
 
</p>
<p><b>F. Indigenous and rural communities</b> 
 
66. The Special Rapporteur considers that exclusion from opportunities of education in 
Mexico has a very specific group of victims, a situation which can be summed up in a 
single sentence: poor people receive poor education. The findings of the ENLACE 
(National Evaluation of Academic Achievement) test tend to support this comment. 
 
67. This assertion is understandable in the light of the great difficulties confronting many 
rural and indigenous communities, historical victims of a lack of education opportunities. 
 
68. Of course, the organization of the education service is determined by population 
density, and it must be remembered that 70 per cent of Mexico&#8217;s rural communities have 
barely 100 inhabitants. This system of organization leaves such communities deprived of 
education opportunities or places their education in the hands of facilitators and extension 
workers contracted by or living on grants from CONAFE who teach in multi-grade schools 
which are often very dilapidated and lacking in any proper sanitation services. 
 
69. The Special Rapporteur considers that the educational needs of the communities served 
by CONAFE should be made a priority of the regular education system in the form of plans 
which embrace emergency resources, teacher training, construction of classrooms, and 
implementation of projects and programmes tailored to the country&#8217;s cultural diversity. 
 
70. The affirmative-action measures should reinforce the campaigns to enhance teachers&#8217; 
status in such a way as to boost the support for their work and promote their improvement 
in all respects. These campaigns should be also accompanied by concrete steps to prevent 
absenteeism among teachers. 
 
71. The existing social asymmetry cannot be corrected by ad hoc measures, not can it be 
claimed that the compensation programmes and subsidies will resolve a structural problem 
connected with the absence of a coordinated and systematic public policy which does not 
change every six years and which addresses the problems of discrimination and social 
exclusion affecting indigenous peoples, rural dwellers, day-labourer families, and persons 
with disabilities. 
 
72. In spite of the efforts made by the Mexican Government, education spending continues 
to discriminate against rural communities. The usual practice is to take a cost/benefit 
approach, under which the installation of education facilities is determined by a specific 
population threshold; this approach has prevented many children and adolescents from 
attending school. 
 
73. The public policies and education plans and programmes should not only address the 
funding aspects but should also make attending to people&#8217;s needs the first priority. 
Accordingly, it is important for the Federal Government to strengthen its public spending 
measures in such a way that the public resources are distributed fairly and provide more 
opportunities for those who have fewest. 
 
74. The disparities are really pronounced in the case of the indigenous peoples, but it is 
also true that more detailed information is required about the problems confronting these 
peoples. For this reason the Special Rapporteur recommends that specific analyses should 
be made of the education needs of the indigenous peoples and of rural areas in general. 
 </p>

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>18  </b>GE.10-13909 (EXT)<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the fact that the exercise of their rights by 
indigenous peoples and the quality of the subsystem designed to attend to their educational 
needs fall far short of the standard. 
</p><p> 
76. It is true that there have been some successes, but in general terms the subsystem&#8217;s 
budget remains very small and the educational model is incapable of rescuing and 
reinforcing the indigenous cultures and languages, a situation aggravated by the lack of 
teacher training. 
 
77. It is also true that the efforts have been concentrated on primary education, with the 
result that indigenous pupil numbers have increased; but the very high drop-out rate in rural 
areas persists, and it remains very difficult for pupils to transfer to the secondary and upper 
secondary levels owing to the shortage of schools. 
 
78. Less than 1 per cent of the indigenous children who enrol in primary school attend 
university (against a figure of 17 per cent for the total population). It has to be 
acknowledged that the intercultural universities are very much in demand in the places 
where they exist, a fact which demonstrates that the indigenous peoples do respond to the 
opportunities offered to them. 
 
</p>
<p><b>G. Intercultural education</b> 
 
79. The bilingual intercultural education strategy is focused primarily on the indigenous 
population, although the plans do include enhancement of the awareness of non-indigenous 
citizens. In general terms the Special Rapporteur notes efforts to address the issue of the 
relevance of education at all levels; evidence of this effort is provided by the creation of a 
degree course in bilingual intercultural primary education and the introduction of courses 
and qualifications in intercultural education for instructors and teachers, with good results. 
 
80. However, the budget of the intercultural education programmes has been sharply 
reduced, and the intercultural approach is generally regarded as a question relating to the 
indigenous peoples and not as a central component of the curriculum. 
 
81. The establishment of the intercultural universities is one of the main achievements of 
the Mexican State. They constitute a strategic education project which seeks to promote the 
training of professionals committed to the economic, social and cultural development of the 
indigenous peoples. These institutions are close in location and in culture to the indigenous 
peoples but they accept students without reference to their family backgrounds. They 
already exist in nine of the country&#8217;s states. No similar undertaking is to be found in other 
levels or modalities of the education service. 
 
</p>
<p><b>H. Day-labourer families</b> 
 
82. Mexico is informally estimated to have 3.1 million day labourers, a million of whom 
are aged under 18. The Special Rapporteur was informed that services are provided for only 
a very small proportion of the children working as day labourers and that they are victims 
of child labour on farms and in the towns. 
 
83. To give some idea of the scale of the problem it should be pointed out that 70 per cent 
of the education deficit is contributed by day-labourer families and that most of the parents 
are totally or functionally illiterate or have large deficits in their education. 
 
84. The Government has devised good practices to address this situation, including the 
single-ticket (<i>boleta &#250;nica</i>) project for day-labourer children. But it has been unable to 
implement this project in full. </p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>85. The Migrant Children Programme (PRONIM) has done excellent work in the fields 
and on farms, sometimes going even further and intervening in communities. However, it 
does not have the capacity to cope with the challenges and it focuses its work chiefly on 
primary education (where the best standards of education are found). 
 
86. Notwithstanding these commendable efforts, there are still problems with the 
recognition of the school-attendance records of children whose day-labourer families move 
around from place to place. In addition, many of these children have no documents, and 
PRONIM and the SEN have to cope with the enormous problem that the school terms often 
do not coincide with the farming cycles, making it even more difficult to attend to the 
educational needs of these children. 
 
87. The undocumented status of migrant children is aggravated by the fact that in many 
cases the civil registry offices charge fees for issuing birth certificates, causing problems for 
the children when they enrol in school or change schools. 
 
</p>
<p><b>I. Persons with disabilities</b> 
 
88. The Special Rapporteur noted the existence of two different strategies (integrative and 
special education) and disparities in the services provided for children with disabilities 
between advanced states such as Nuevo Le&#243;n and poorer ones such as Chiapas. He was also 
informed that many children with disabilities do not attend school, either because the 
schools are not authorized to accept them or because their parents prefer to keep them at 
home. 
 
89. Working through the country&#8217;s rehabilitation centres, the National System for Integral 
Development of the Family (SNDIF) promotes the prevention of disability and facilitates 
the rehabilitation and social reintegration of persons with disabilities, encouraging full 
respect for the exercise of their rights to equality of opportunities and to equity in access to 
education services, as well as to all those services which contribute to their well-being and 
improve their quality of life. 
 
90. To this end the SNDIF, working through the Directorate General for Rehabilitation and 
Social Assistance, uses two different models to meet the need for educational integration: 
(a) the programme of educational integration for children with disabilities, which has been 
operating in the rehabilitation centres since 2002 and has to date enrolled a total of 6,434 
children with disabilities in regular and special basic education; and (b) the educational 
integration model of the Gaby Brimmer Research and Training Centre for Rehabilitation 
and Educational Integration, which makes joint use of the SNDIF and the Ministry of 
Public Education to provide basic education services, school transport, school meals, and 
specialized medical care for children with severe disabilities. 
 
91. In 2007 the SNDIF signed an agreement with INEA under which they endeavour to 
support persons with some degree of disability who are illiterate or have an educational 
deficit. 
 
92. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that Mexico has undertaken to carry out the 
National Programme for the Development of Persons with Disabilities 2009-2012. This 
programme proposes nine specific targets, including &#8220;improving the quality of education 
and expanding the opportunities of access, the retention and graduation rates, and the levels </p>

</b> 
</p>
<p>of educational attainment for persons with disabilities in the various types, levels and 
modalities of the National Education System&#8221;.57 
 
</p>
<p><b>J. Quality and equality in education</b> 
 
93. The Special Rapporteur considers that quality should be regarded as an essential 
component of the right to education: it is intrinsically interlinked with education provision, 
access and spending and should therefore be incorporated in public policies; and it is 
primarily a responsibility of the Federation and the federal entities. 
 
94. The Mexican Government has demonstrated a constant concern with the quality of 
education and has carried out affirmative projects to deal with ad hoc problems of 
infrastructure, for example, as in the case of the &#8220;Quality Schools&#8221; programme. 
 
95. The Government has also carried out experiments such as &#8220;Full-Time Schools&#8221; and 
&#8220;Always-Open Schools&#8221;, which have made it possible to maximize the available learning 
time in many communities. In addition, the Government has offered salary bonuses to 
teaching personnel and has rewarded effort in many different ways. 
 
96. Lastly, it has promoted the &#8220;Alliance for Quality in Education&#8221;, which addresses 
crucial topics of public education and which actually embraces core obligations of the State 
already set out in the Constitution and in the instruments of international law which Mexico 
has ratified. 
 
97. This Alliance has been criticized by various population groups and in several federal 
entities because it is not the outcome of a public debate or of a broad social consensus but is 
instead a political agreement between the SNTE and the Ministry of Public Education. One 
of the most controversial aspects of the Alliance was the introduction of a mechanism for 
entering and advancing in the teaching profession by means of public competitions. This 
mechanism was used for the first time in 2008; on that occasion dissident groups in the 
profession opposed its use in Michoac&#225;n, Morelos, Guerrero and Oaxaca. 
 
98. In 2009 the Ministry of Public Education and the SNTE created the Federal 
Independent Evaluation Board (OEIF), which has 70 members, including representatives of 
the Ministry, the SNTE and the states. The competition in that year attracted 124,000 
candidates, 31,000 of whom were classified as &#8220;acceptable&#8221;. No competitions were held in 
Michoac&#225;n or Oaxaca (where the trade union shops are not aligned with the SNTE). 
 
99. The design and conduct of these competitions do not reflect a systematic public policy 
built around the fight against discrimination in education or indeed an education model 
which caters for the diversity and addresses the need for education opportunities to be 
consistent with the purposes established in international human rights law. 
 
100. The main problem is that the social inequalities, which affect primarily the 
marginalized population groups, are not taken into account in the provision of education 
and that this provision does not include structural measures to cater to their needs more 
effectively or sufficient resources to provide them with a better service. Although important 
measures have been introduced, such as for example the &#8220;Learning Communities&#8221; 
programme, it would appear that the system reproduces these inequalities or makes only 
slow progress towards their elimination.

<p><b>K. Testing the education proposals</b> 
 
101. In response to the State&#8217;s concern to address the problems of quality in education, the 
Federal Government and the federal entities have made progress in constructing systems of 
indicators, and they are currently applying standardized tests (PISA, ENLACE, 
EXCALE).58 
 
102. However, the quality of education cannot be addressed or improved by applying 
standardized tests: although such tests may be useful, being standardized they cannot offer 
responses to the variety of social and cultural expression or take into account the many 
different nuances at the grass roots. In practice, the tests have had a problematic effect, for 
they unfairly project a bad image of teachers, giving the impression that the problems of 
educational efficiency are attributable solely to them and not to an education system which 
is slow to implement consistent public policies. What it appears may happen is that teachers 
will end up teaching for the tests, which would be a most undesirable development. 
 
</p>
<p><b>L. Incorporating the humanities in the curriculum and achieving the 
purposes of education 
 
</b>103. It must be remembered that the ultimate purpose of education is to improve the quality 
of life in all senses. There is therefore a need to bolster the curriculum with content 
designed to deliver comprehensive knowledge and to educate individuals; it is thus 
important to provide for the study of philosophy, the humanities, ethics and aesthetics as 
subjects which develop creativity and a critical outlook in students, especially in secondary 
and upper secondary education. 
 
104. The Government&#8217;s initiatives with respect to the formulation of a national plan for 
human rights education must therefore be reactivated and a welcome given to contributions 
from the academic world and civil society. 
 
</p>
<p><b>M. Participation</b> 
 
105. The Special Rapporteur noted during his visit that civil society organizations are not 
involved in the effort to meet the needs in education. With some exceptions, it would 
appear that few attempts are made to encourage the involvement of society in decision-
making. 
 
106. Such involvement has in fact been encouraged in the governmental context through the 
social participation councils, which are regulated by law. These councils are barely 
operational in many federal entities and, what is even worse, the National Social 
Participation Council has not met for 10 years. 
 
107. The Special Rapporteur considers that social participation in education should not be 
limited to the concrete problems of the schools but should spread itself wider to fuel the 
debate about education policies; this is a task which the National Commission on Human 
Rights (CNDH) should facilitate. Making provision for the direct participation of children 
is an obligation set down in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and should be 
directly promoted by the education authorities. To this end it is a matter of genuine urgency 
to create a State institution responsible for the promotion and protection of the rights of 
children.

<p><b>V. Recommendations 
 
</b>108.<b> In the light of the foregoing discussion the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that: 
 
 (a) The measures to eliminate completely the payment of fees for education 
should be reinforced and fixed targets should be set for achieving gradual compliance 
with the obligation to allocate 8 per cent of GDP to education, with annual 0.5 per cent 
increases until the level established by law is attained; 
 
 (b) Emergency action should be taken to combat educational deficits in 
persons aged over 15; 
 
 (c) An increasing budget should be provided for the programmes and 
departments concerned with indigenous education and intercultural education. In the 
latter case an effort should also be made to amend the legal framework of public 
education so as to spell out the principles on which the attainment of an inclusive 
society should be based and deliver education which acknowledges the importance of 
the country&#8217;s linguistic and cultural diversity; 
 
 (d) Investment and the production of infrastructure, educational materials 
and support  resources for schools for persons with disabilities should be stepped up, 
with a view to these persons&#8217; gradual integration in the normal education system; 
 
 (e) The humanities should be incorporated or strengthened at all levels and 
in all modalities of education, and the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education should be introduced, with the emphasis placed on gender equality and 
with account taken of the country&#8217;s linguistic and cultural diversity; 
 
 (f) A widespread process of consultation involving civil society should be 
introduced to discuss the needs and challenges of quality in education and the changes 
required in the existing programmes; 
 
 (g) Plans should be formulated to regularize education services in rural 
areas, including the education and training and the supply of professional teaching 
personnel, and to provide quality infrastructure in sufficient quantity to guarantee 
exercise of their right to education by rural dwellers. A transitional process should be 
introduced to this end, so that the education services currently provided by the 
National Council for the Promotion of Education (CONAFE) are gradually taken over 
by the public education authorities; 
 
 (h) The services for families who migrate within the country, known as day 
labourers (<i>jornaleros</i>), should be strengthened in order to provide them with 
opportunities to obtain quality education, the school terms should be brought into line 
with the farming seasons, and the coverage should be expanded to include secondary 
education. It is also essential to harmonize the education service with the work 
obligations of working parents and young people; 
 
 (i) The projects and programmes for promoting civic participation, 
including participation by civil society organizations and children, should be 
strengthened in all areas of education; 
 
 (j) The National Commission on Human Rights should devise consistent and 
systematic emergency programmes to defend the right to education, chiefly in three 
specific respects: the invocation and assertion of the right at law, the encouragement </b></p>

<p><b>of participation, and the oversight of legality in a context of the implementation of 
rights-based education policies; 
 
 (k) The technical independence of the National Institute for the Evaluation of 
Education (INEE) should be reinforced, in order that it may continue to produce 
external evaluations of the quality of education and thus help to improve Mexico&#8217;s 
education system. This means that INEE will have to be covered by ordinary 
legislation providing it with a sounder legal foundation; 
 
 (l) Consistent, adaptable and flexible institutional arrangements should be 
established in the education sector for examining and discussing the findings of the 
INEE studies and their implications and the suggestions which they make concerning 
education policy; 
 
 (m) The legal foundations should be laid for recognizing and legitimizing 
independent and plural trade union movements in the education sector; 
 
 (n) More detailed diagnoses should be made of the educational needs of the 
indigenous peoples and of rural areas in general; 
 
 (o) Immediate steps should be taken to ensure that all civil registry 
procedures and services are entirely free of charge.
