Item 8.01 Other Events.
Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to
recast certain previously reported amounts to conform with the segment reporting changes made
in connection with realignment of our organization structure, with respect to the financial
information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
(“2015 Form 10-K”).
In the first quarter of 2016, the Company realigned its segments. Completions was designated as
a separate segment in recognition of its expanded operations and its significant growth potential.
The Company is reporting its results of operations in the three reportable segments: Drilling &
Subsea, Completions and Production & Infrastructure, instead of the original two reportable
segments. Management’s change in the composition of the Company’s reporting segments was
made in order to align with activity drivers and the customers of our product group, and how
management reviews and evaluates operating performance. We provided a brief description of
the new reporting structure in a press release issued on April 28, 2016, including a
comprehensive summary of the effects of these changes, and the impact on the Company’s
historical segment results for fiscal years 2015 and 2014.
The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require that when a registrant prepares,
on or after the date a registrant reports an accounting change such as the change noted above, a
new registration, proxy or information statement (or amends a previously filed registration, proxy,
or information statement) that includes or incorporates by reference financial statements, the
registrant must recast the prior period financial statements included or incorporated by reference
in the registration, proxy or information statement to reflect these types of changes. Accordingly,
the Company is filing this Form 8-K to recast our consolidated financial statements for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, to reflect the changes in segment reporting
as described above. The updates do not represent a restatement of previously issued financial
statements. The recast information of Items contained in the Company’s 2015 Form 10-K is
presented in Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, and 99.4 to this Form 8-K.
The information included in this Form 8-K is presented for informational purposes only in
connection with the reporting changes described above and does not amend or restate our
audited consolidated financial statements, which were included in our 2015 Form 10-K. This
Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring after we filed our 2015 Form 10-K and does not
modify or update the disclosures therein in any way, other than to illustrate the realignment of our
organizational structure as described above. For developments subsequent to the filing of the
2015 Form 10-K, refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
2016 and June 30, 2016.
