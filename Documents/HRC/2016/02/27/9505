</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102, details 
the principal activities of the Special Rapporteur in 2006.  It also examines four issues of 
particular importance.   
</p>
<p>1.<b> The mandate of the Special Rapporteur in armed conflicts.  </b>The report rejects the 
notion, put forward by one State in particular, that matters arising in the context of armed 
conflict are beyond the purview not only of the Special Rapporteur but of the Human Rights 
Council itself.  Such an approach would contradict very long-standing policies of the 
Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council, and the General Assembly 
and would critically undermine their ability to address pressing threats to human rights in many 
of the situations before the Council. 
</p>
<p>2.<b> &#8220;Mercy killings&#8221; in armed conflict.  </b>Accepting the notion of so-called &#8220;mercy killings&#8221; 
would undermine key rules of international law applicable during armed conflicts.  The 
prohibition under international humanitarian law of killing those who have laid down their arms 
or have been placed <i>hors de combat</i> by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause must be 
resolutely upheld. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>Most serious crimes.  </b>The requirement of human rights law that the death penalty should 
be imposed only for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; continues to be interpreted subjectively by certain 
States.  The report examines the <i>travaux</i> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, surveys the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee, and analyses the comments 
by the Secretary-General, principles declared by the Economic and Social Council and the 
Commission on Human Rights and concludes that, if it is to comply with the most serious crimes 
restriction, the death penalty can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was 
an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life. 
</p>
<p>4. <b>Mandatory death sentences.  </b>The experience of numerous judicial and quasi-judicial 
bodies has demonstrated that mandatory death sentences are inherently over-inclusive and 
unavoidably violate human rights law.  The categorical distinctions that may be drawn between 
offences in the criminal law are not sufficient to reflect the full range of factors relevant to 
determining whether a death sentence would be permissible in a capital case.  In such cases, 
individualized sentencing by the judiciary is required in order to prevent cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment and the arbitrary deprivation of life. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION  
</b></p>
<p>1. In addition to reporting on the principal initiatives undertaken in 2006 to address the 
scourge of extrajudicial executions around the world,<b>1</b> this report focuses on four issues of 
particular importance:  (a) the mandate of the Special Rapporteur in armed conflicts; (b) &#8220;mercy 
killings&#8221; in armed conflict; (c) the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; for which the death penalty may be 
imposed; and (d) the international law status of the mandatory death penalty. 
</p>
<p>2. The report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 1/102. 
</p>
<p>3. The report takes account of information received and communications sent in the 
period 1 December 2005 to 30 September 2006.  It should be noted, however, that the addendum 
to the present report - which contains the details of the communications sent and the replies 
received - follows a different chronology, the details of which are explained below.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>4. An overview of my terms of reference, a list of the specific types of violations of the 
right to life upon which I take action, and a description of the legal framework and methods of 
work used in implementing this mandate can be found in document E/CN.4/2005/7, 
paragraphs 5-12.   
</p>
<p>5. I am grateful to the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
for their assistance in the conduct of my work, and to Mr. William Abresch and 
Mr. Jason Morgan-Foster of the Project on Extrajudicial Executions at New York University 
Law School, who have provided expert assistance and advice.   
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>6. An indispensable aspect of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate involves the sending of 
communications designed to facilitate a productive and meaningful dialogue with Governments 
in response to credible allegations of violations relating to extrajudicial executions. 
7. This report covers communications sent and replies received over the past year.<b>3</b>  The 
details of my concerns and the information provided in response by Governments are reflected in 
considerable detail in addendum 1 to this report.  That addendum is an integral, and for some 
purposes even the most important, part of the report on work done under this mandate.  I have 
classified the responses received according to their level of adequacy and have provided 
evaluative &#8220;observations&#8221; designed to capture the outcome of each set of exchanges with a 
Government. 
</p>
<p>8. A very brief statistical profile of the communications sent during the period under review 
shows that 135 communications were sent to 51 countries and 2 other actors (including 44 urgent 
appeals and 75 letters of allegation and 16 communications following up on previous 
correspondence) concerning a total of more than 1,531 individuals.  A breakdown of the subjects </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of those appeals shows that they involved 336 males, 55 females, more than 1,087 persons 
whose sex was unknown, 53 minors, 58 members of religious, ethnic or indigenous minorities, 
22 human rights defenders, 36 migrants and 16 journalists.  More than 145 persons were killed 
for exercising their freedom of opinion and expression, 4 were killed in the name of honour, 
4 were killed for their sexual orientation and 19 of those killed were suspected terrorists. 
</p>
<p>9. Overall, the proportion of government replies received to communications sent during the 
period under review remains low:  an average of 47.9 per cent.  (However, if government replies 
received during the period under review but relating to communications sent during the previous 
period are included, the proportion of communications to which replies were received rises to 
55.3 per cent.)  This means that, as during the previous year, roughly half of the communications 
sent drew no response from the Government concerned within a reasonable time period.  As 
indicated in my previous report, this response rate must be considered problematic, particularly 
in the case of a long-established procedure that addresses an issue as grave as the alleged 
violations of the right to life. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Visits undertaken in 2006 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the course of 2006, I undertook two visits:   
</p>
<p> (a) <b>Guatemala.  </b>I visited Guatemala from 21 to 25 August 2006 at the invitation of 
its Government and met with government officials and members of civil society.  In Guatemala, 
over 5,000 people die violently each year.  A degree of State responsibility derives from the 
involvement of its agents in some forms of violence and its ineffectual response to others.  
During my visit, I gathered evidence on the prevalence and causes of phenomena such as social 
cleansing, &#8220;femicide&#8221;, lynching, killings motivated by sexual orientation or identity, the killing 
of human rights defenders and prison violence.  Guatemala&#8217;s choice is between a human 
rights-consistent approach based on a working system of criminal justice (and in line with the 
vision of the Peace Accords) or a brutal and repressive response, often advocated under the 
rubric of a <i>mano dura</i> (iron fist), to crack down on &#8220;undesirable&#8221; elements.  My report is in 
document A/HRC/4/20/Add.2. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Lebanon and Israel.  </b>I undertook a joint visit with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, the Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced 
persons and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living.  We visited Lebanon from 7 to 10 September and Israel from 10 to 
14 September 2006.  Our report (A/HRC/2/7) found that, in many instances, Israel had violated 
human rights and humanitarian law by failing to fully distinguish between military and civilian 
objectives, to fully apply the principle of proportionality, and to take all feasible precautions to 
minimize civilian injury and damage.  With respect to Hezbollah, our report found that it had 
violated humanitarian law by targeting civilian populations and by disregarding the principle of 
distinction.<b>4</b>   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Outstanding requests for visits 
</b></p>
<p>11. As of December 2006 I had made requests to visit 29 countries and the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories.  Of those 29, only 5 countries - Guatemala, Israel, Lebanon, Peru and 
the Philippines - have actually proceeded with plans for a visit.  The visit to the Philippines is 
scheduled for February 2007, the visit to Peru was postponed for technical reasons, and the 
Palestinian Authority has issued an invitation.  Singapore has requested further information. 
</p>
<p>12. The responses of the remaining 23 countries have ranged from complete silence, through 
formal acknowledgement, to acceptance in principle but without meaningful follow-up.  
Particularly troubling is the fact that seven Council members have failed to issue requested 
invitations:  Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and 
Saudi Arabia.  In some cases the relevant requests were first made some six years ago.  It is 
noteworthy that the General Assembly responded to this situation in December 2006 by urging 
&#8220;all States, in particular those that have not done so, to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur so 
that his mandate can be carried out effectively, including by favourably and rapidly responding 
to requests for visits, mindful that country visits are one of the tools for the fulfilment of the 
mandate &#8230;&#8221;.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>13. The remaining States that have so far failed to respond affirmatively to requests for a visit 
are:  Brazil, Central African Republic, El Salvador, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Kenya, 
Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Peru, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, 
Togo, Uganda, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Viet Nam and Yemen. 
</p>
<p>14. For a comprehensive list of the status of all outstanding requests, see annex 1. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Islamic Republic of Iran has issued a &#8220;standing invitation&#8221; to the special procedures 
but has repeatedly failed to respond to my requests that dates for a visit be set, despite an oral 
exchange during the third session of the Council, several high-level meetings and an extensive 
correspondence.  In my annual report to the Commission and the Council in 2006 
(E/CN.4/2006/53 and addenda) I drew particular attention to this situation. 
</p>
<p>16. Between August 2004 and March 2006 I sent 12 communications, involving nine boys 
and six girls who had been sentenced to death in Iran for crimes committed when they were 
under 18.  Three girls were sentenced for murder and three others for &#8220;acts contrary to chastity&#8221;.  
Four boys were sentenced for murder, one for drug trafficking, three for abduction and rape, and 
one for attempted hijacking.  According to the available information four juvenile offenders have 
been executed and two acquitted.  Five other death sentences are &#8220;on hold&#8221; and one is under 
review.  The status of the remaining three cases is unclear. 
</p>
<p>17. The information received is clearly credible and there is every reason to believe that the 
Iranian judiciary is freely ignoring the prohibition on the juvenile death penalty.  This constitutes 
a clear violation of Iran&#8217;s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  There is no other country in the world in 
relation to which I regularly receive allegations of this type.  This is not surprising, since the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>juvenile death penalty has been specifically abolished in virtually every other country.  If the 
Council is to take seriously its responsibilities in relation to extrajudicial executions, it will 
respond appropriately to this wholly unacceptable situation. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ISSUES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The mandate of the Special Rapporteur in armed conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>18. An earlier report examined the law applicable to violations of the right to life in armed 
conflict and the role of the Special Rapporteur in response thereto.<b>6</b>  This view has, however, 
been consistently rejected by one State.  These objections, by the United States of America, have 
been raised in a wide range of contexts, thus underscoring the importance of carefully examining 
their validity.  In essence, the United States position consists of four propositions:  (a) the &#8220;war 
on terror&#8221; constitutes an armed conflict to which international humanitarian law applies; 
(b) international humanitarian law operates to the exclusion of human rights law; 
(c) international humanitarian law falls outside the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and of the 
Council; and (d) States may determine for themselves whether an individual incident is governed 
by humanitarian law or human rights law.<b>7</b>  If accepted, these propositions would have 
far-reaching consequences for the Council and for its ability to contribute in any way to many of 
the situations that are currently most prominent on its agenda. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The alleged exclusivity of the two bodies of law 
</b></p>
<p>19. Contrary to this proposition, it is widely agreed that the two bodies of law, far from being 
mutually exclusive, are complementary.  The International Court of Justice has observed that the 
test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life in the context of hostilities &#8220;falls to be determined 
by the applicable <i>lex specialis</i>, namely, the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to 
regulate the conduct of hostilities&#8221;.<b>8</b>  But it went on to clarify that &#8220;the protection offered by 
human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of 
provisions for derogation &#8230;&#8221;.<b>9</b>  In <i>Congo v. Uganda</i>, for example, it found separate violations of 
international humanitarian law and human rights law, thus conclusively underscoring the fact 
that the former does not wholly replace the latter during an armed conflict.<b>10</b>  This is consistent 
with the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee that while &#8220;more specific rules of 
international humanitarian law may be specially relevant for the purposes of the interpretation of 
[certain] Covenant rights, both spheres of law are complementary, not mutually exclusive&#8221;.<b>11</b>  
Similarly, the Commission and the General Assembly have regularly reaffirmed &#8220;that 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law are complementary and not 
mutually exclusive&#8221;.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Humanitarian law in the Commission&#8217;s mandate 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Commission on Human Rights, with the consistent endorsement of the Economic 
and Social Council, regularly treated international humanitarian law as falling within its terms of 
reference.  Examples of this practice abound,<b>13</b> and it suffices to cite three examples.  First, in 
relation to the former Yugoslavia, the Commission, in 1992, &#8220;call[ed] upon all parties &#8230; to 
ensure full respect for &#8230; humanitarian law&#8221;<b>14</b> and &#8220;[r]emind[ed] all parties that they are bound to 
comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law &#8230;&#8221;.<b>15</b>  This resolution was 
subsequently endorsed by the Economic and Social Council.<b>16</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. Two years later, in relation to the same situation, the Commission &#8220;[c]ondemn[ed] 
categorically all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all sides&#8221;.<b>17</b>  
It then applied international humanitarian law to the situation and &#8220;denounce[d] continued 
deliberate and unlawful attacks and uses of military force against civilians and other protected 
persons &#8230; non-combatants, &#8230; [and] &#8230; relief operations&#8221;.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>22. Third, in relation to Rwanda, the Commission &#8220;[c]ondemn[ed] in the strongest terms all 
breaches of international humanitarian law &#8230; and call[ed] upon all the parties involved to cease 
immediately these breaches&#8221;.<b>19</b>  It also &#8220;[c]all[ed] upon the Government of Rwanda to &#8230; take 
measures to put an end to all violations of &#8230; international humanitarian law by all persons 
within its jurisdiction or under its control&#8221;.<b>20</b> 
23. As these examples make clear, both the Commission and the Council clearly and 
repeatedly accepted that international humanitarian law formed part of the Commission&#8217;s terms 
of reference.  In replacing the Commission by the Council, the General Assembly in no way 
undertook to narrow its competence in this respect.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate is &#8220;to examine &#8230; questions related to summary or 
arbitrary executions&#8221;.  No reference is made to a limiting legal framework which would exclude 
certain such executions.<b>22</b>  Instead, the mandate has been defined in terms of the phenomenon of 
executions, in whatever context they might occur.  In contrast, the United States position is that 
&#8220;while the Special Rapporteur may have reported on cases outside of his mandate, this does not 
give [him] the competence to address such issues&#8221;.  It is certainly correct that the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s practice does not, on its own, establish competence.  But when based on the terms 
of the relevant resolutions, and reinforced by the actions and votes of Governments in the 
Commission, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, the Special 
Rapporteur is clearly not acting unilaterally.  Of the many possible illustrations of this process,<b>23</b> 
the following are indicative. 
</p>
<p>25. First, in 1983, in the very first report under the mandate, my distinguished predecessor, 
Mr. Amos Wako, included a substantive section on &#8220;Killings in war, armed conflict and states of 
emergency&#8221; under the heading of international legal standards.<b>24</b>  In that section, he noted that 
&#8220;[t]he Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 are also relevant &#8230;  Each of the Geneva 
Conventions clearly prohibits murder and other acts of violence against protected persons.  They 
explicitly provide that &#8216;wilful killings&#8217; are to be considered &#8216;grave breaches&#8217; of the Geneva 
Conventions, that is, war crimes subject to universality of jurisdiction.&#8221;<b>25</b>  His report was 
endorsed by the Commission.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Second, in January 1992 Mr. Wako annexed to his annual report a &#8220;List of Instruments 
and other Standards which Constitute the Legal Framework of the Mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8221;.<b>27</b>  The Geneva Conventions appear as item 3 in a 14-point list.  This report was also 
endorsed by the Commission which explicitly &#8220;welcome[d] his recommendations &#8230;&#8221;,<b>28</b> some of 
which had focused explicitly on extrajudicial executions during armed conflict.<b>29</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Determining compliance 
</b></p>
<p>27. The position put forward by the United States would give every State the power 
unilaterally, and without external scrutiny, to determine whether or not a specific incident is 
covered by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.  The implication is that the Special 
Rapporteur should automatically accept a State&#8217;s own determination that a particular individual 
was an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; attacked in &#8220;appropriate circumstances&#8221;.  On this basis, a 
Government can target and kill any individual who it deems to be an enemy combatant, and it 
would not be accountable in that regard to the international community, let alone to the Council. 
</p>
<p>28. In effect, this position would place all actions taken in the so-called &#8220;global war on 
terror&#8221; in a public accountability void, in which no international monitoring body would exercise 
public oversight.<b>30</b>  Creating such a vacuum would set back the development of the international 
human rights regime by several decades.  In order to avoid such an unacceptable outcome, the 
Special Rapporteur would need to receive a detailed explanation of such incidents, so that he 
may determine independently whether they fall within the scope of the mandate provided by  
the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  &#8220;Mercy killings&#8221; in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>29. The expression &#8220;mercy killings&#8221; has recently been used to characterize certain killings by 
the military in the context of armed conflicts.  One example concerns the court martial of 
Capt. Rogelio Maynulet for the shooting of an Iraqi man in Baghdad in May 2004.  A &#8220;mercy 
killing&#8221; argument was central to the defence.<b>31</b>  Although originally charged with murder for 
shooting twice at point-blank range,<b>32</b> Maynulet was ultimately convicted of assault with intent 
to commit voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to dismissal from the army and no 
confinement.<b>33</b>  Another example, also from Iraq, is the invocation of a mercy killing defence for 
two soldiers who mistakenly opened fire on what appears to have been a group of non-combatant 
teenagers.  Realizing their mistake, medics hurried to treat the injured, when, according to 
reports, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[a] dispute broke out among a handful of soldiers standing over one severely wounded 
young man who was moaning in pain.  An unwounded Iraqi claiming to be a relative of 
the victim pleaded in broken English for soldiers to help him.  But to the horror of 
bystanders, Alban, 29, a boyish-faced sergeant who joined the Army in 1997, retrieved an 
M-231 assault rifle and fired into the wounded man&#8217;s body.  Seconds later, another 
soldier, Staff Sgt. Johnny Horne, Jr., 30, of Winston-Salem, NC, grabbed an M-16 rifle 
and also shot the victim&#8221;.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>30. On this basis United States officials characterized the shooting as a &#8220;mercy killing&#8221;, 
citing statements by Alban and Horne that they had shot the wounded Iraqi &#8220;to put him out of his 
misery&#8221;.<b>35</b>  Subsequently, other soldiers present at the scene expressed surprise that the victims 
were not rushed to hospital.<b>36</b>  In January 2005, Alban was convicted of murder and conspiracy 
to commit murder after a one-day court martial in Baghdad.  He was sentenced to one year&#8217;s 
confinement, demotion to private and a bad-conduct discharge.<b>37</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. A third example concerns a recommendation that Specialist Juston R. Graber be 
court-martialled for killing an Iraqi in a raid on a potential insurgent stronghold north-west of 
Baghdad.  Informed reports suggest that the &#8220;mercy killing&#8221; defence would also be raised in this 
case, as Graber allegedly shot the Iraqi in the head as the man lay dying.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Despite the extent to which military officials, commentators, and even military judges 
seem willing to entertain a &#8220;mercy killing&#8221; defence, it is clear that such a characterization is 
entirely unacceptable under the applicable rules of international humanitarian law.  In 
international armed conflicts, article 12 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the 
Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (First Geneva Convention) is 
clear that the wounded or sick &#8220;shall be respected and protected in all circumstances &#8230;  Any 
attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, 
they shall not be murdered &#8230;&#8221;.<b>39</b>  The ICRC Commentary on this provision, based on the 
<i>travaux pr&#233;paratoires</i>, considers such &#8220;derelictions of duty &#8230; [to be] the gravest a belligerent 
can commit in regard to the wounded and sick in his power&#8221;.<b>40</b>  It notes that &#8220;the heinous crimes 
in question were already prohibited in the 1929 text, which established the principle of respect 
and protection in all circumstances - a principle which is general and absolute in character&#8221;.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Although the Geneva Conventions of 1949 limited most protection of the wounded and 
sick to a narrow class of &#8220;protected persons&#8221;, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva 
Conventions expanded the scope of protection to cover all persons affected by international 
armed conflict.  Article 75 of Additional Protocol I extends protection to those persons who do 
not qualify for the status of &#8220;protected persons&#8221; under the 1949 Conventions; this article includes 
protection against &#8220;violence to &#8230; life, health, or physical or mental well-being &#8230; in particular, 
murder&#8221;.<b>42</b>  Similarly, article 8 (a) of Protocol I expands the definition of &#8220;wounded and sick&#8221; to 
include civilians as well as soldiers.<b>43</b>  Such persons would also benefit from the protection of 
common article 3 to the Geneva Conventions, as discussed below, which constitute &#8220;a minimum 
yardstick&#8221; applicable to all armed conflicts.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>34. In non-international armed conflicts, common article 3 to the Geneva Conventions 
requires that &#8220;members of armed forces &#8230; placed <i>hors de combat </i>by sickness, wounds, 
detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely &#8230; .  To this end, the 
following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with 
respect to the above-mentioned persons:  (a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of 
all kinds&#8221;.<b>45</b>  Additional Protocol II further states that &#8220;[a]ll the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, 
whether or not they have taken part in the armed conflict, shall be respected and protected&#8221;<b>46</b> and 
&#8220;all possible measures shall be taken &#8230; to search for and collect the wounded &#8230; [and] protect 
them against &#8230; ill-treatment&#8221;.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>35. The prohibition of murder of persons <i>hors de combat </i>and the obligation to protect the 
wounded from adverse treatment are norms of customary international law applicable in both 
international and non-international armed conflicts.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Although such &#8220;mercy killings&#8221; are sometimes presented as a &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; of war, 
such an analysis contradicts the foundations of the applicable law.  Once enemy combatants have 
been rendered <i>hors de combat </i>by injury, they are no longer a threat to the opposing combatants, 
and there is simply no reason why it would be &#8220;necessary&#8221; to kill them.<b>49</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. Proponents of &#8220;mercy killings&#8221; often justify them out of compassion, but in practice they 
are much more likely to reflect an underlying dehumanization of the enemy.  For example, Iraqis 
who witnessed the shootings by Alban and Horne said that &#8220;rather than provide medical help to 
an injured civilian, the soldiers had treated the Iraqi as if he were an animal struck by a car&#8221;.<b>50</b> 
38. It warrants underlining the fact that international humanitarian law does not allow - under 
any circumstances - the taking of the life of another as a purported act of &#8220;mercy&#8221;.  The 
obligation to treat injured soldiers &#8220;humanely&#8221; and the obligation to &#8220;respect and protect&#8221; the 
wounded are incompatible with the idea of &#8220;mercy killings&#8221;.  Rather, the obligation of parties to 
a conflict, in the presence of injured persons, is (i) to &#8220;take all possible measures to search for, 
collect and evacuate the wounded, sick and shipwrecked without adverse distinction&#8221;<b>51</b> and 
(ii) to seek the appropriate medical care to the fullest extent practicable and with the least 
possible delay.<b>52</b>  Individual parties to the conflict, who lack medical training, may not take the 
medical care of the wounded into their own hands by deciding to end the life of an injured 
person on the battlefield.  Such killings are an unequivocal violation of international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Imposing the death penalty only for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>39. International human rights law provides that States which retain the death penalty can 
only impose it for &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221;.  That phrase has thus assumed major importance in 
efforts to determine when the death penalty might acceptably be imposed.  While its precise 
meaning has not been spelled out in treaty form, the debates over its drafting, principles of 
interpretation adopted subsequently, and the by now very extensive practice of international 
human rights mechanisms have all combined to clarify the meaning and significance of the 
phrase. 
</p>
<p>40. The first Special Rapporteur dealt with the issue of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; as early 
as 1984 when he surveyed the death penalty legislation of States to assess the range of offences 
for which it was then imposed in practice.<b>53</b>  The results of the survey contributed to the 
elaboration of the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death 
penalty, which were adopted by the Economic and Social Council later that year.<b>54</b>  In his next 
report, the Special Rapporteur noted that these safeguards would &#8220;serve as criteria for 
ascertaining whether an execution is of a summary or arbitrary nature&#8221;,<b>55</b> and he began to 
consider particular situations implicating the most serious crimes limitation.<b>56</b>  In subsequent 
reports, the Special Rapporteur drew on the safeguards and their follow-up by the Council as 
well as on the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee in determining whether particular 
offences fell within or outside the scope of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; requirement.<b>57</b>  In 
communications with Governments, the Special Rapporteur has addressed death sentences for 
offences and conduct including<b>58</b> adultery,<b>59</b> apostasy,<b>60</b> blasphemy,<b>61</b> bribery,<b>62</b> acts 
incompatible with chastity,<b>63</b> corruption,<b>64</b> drug possession,<b>65</b> drug trafficking,<b>66</b> drug-related 
offences,<b>67</b> economic offences,<b>68</b> expressing oneself,<b>69</b> holding an opinion,<b>70</b> homosexual acts,<b>71</b> 
matters of sexual orientation,<b>72</b> manifesting one&#8217;s religion or beliefs,<b>73</b> prostitution,<b>74</b> 
organization of prostitution,<b>75</b> participation in protests,<b>76</b> premarital sex,<b>77</b> singing songs inciting 
men to go to war,<b>78</b> sodomy,<b>79</b> speculation,<b>80</b> &#8220;acts of treason, espionage or other vaguely defined 
acts usually described as &#8216;crimes against the State&#8217;&#8221;,<b>81</b> and writing slogans against a country&#8217;s </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>leader.<b>82</b>  The range of offences involved invites an inquiry into the underlying normative 
rationale, and suggests that problems of non-compliance have remained widespread.  It is clear 
that a subjective approach to this important issue is not viable, in the sense that a vast array of 
offences might understandably be classified by any given individual or Government as being 
among the &#8220;most serious&#8221;.  But such an approach would render the relevant international law 
standard meaningless.  As a result a systematic and normatively persuasive response is essential. 
</p>
<p>41. The basic requirement was first introduced in article 6 (2) of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time 
of the commission of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present Covenant 
and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  This 
penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a competent 
court.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>42. This provision supplemented that prohibiting the arbitrary deprivation of life, in 
article 6 (1): 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every human being has the inherent right to life.  This right shall be protected by law.  
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.&#8221;<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>43. It has been much commented upon that neither term - &#8220;arbitrarily deprived&#8221; or &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221; - is further defined in ICCPR.  In this regard, various sources are illuminating.  
And while the <i>travaux pr&#233;paratoires</i> are but a supplementary means of interpretation, they do 
assist in understanding the ordinary meanings of these terms. 
</p>
<p>44. One insight that emerges from the <i>travaux</i> of article 6 of ICCPR is that the concepts of 
arbitrariness and of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; serve to add a requirement of substantive justice to 
the requirements of formal legality and due process.  An early version of the article stated that it 
&#8220;shall be unlawful to deprive any person of his life&#8221; with the one exception being upon 
&#8220;conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law&#8221;.<b>84</b>  Notably, this version, which 
implied that the legality of an execution would be determined solely within the domestic legal 
order, was rejected.  A number of delegates pointed out that it would permit what amounted to 
arbitrary killing to be masked by the trappings of law.<b>85</b>  Various substantive limits on the scope 
of death penalty laws were thus introduced, including a prohibition of arbitrary deprivations of 
life (with &#8220;arbitrarily&#8221; meaning either &#8220;illegally&#8221; or &#8220;unjustly&#8221;<b>86</b>), a prohibition of death 
sentences for other than the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, and a requirement that any such deprivation 
be consistent with ICCPR and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide.<b>87</b>  To determine whether a particular offence falls among the most serious crimes, 
thus, requires interpretation and application of the relevant international law rather than of the 
subjective approach opted for within a given State&#8217;s criminal code and sentencing scheme. 
45. Another key insight to be drawn from the <i>travaux</i> relates to the apparent imprecision of 
the terms used to define the scope of the right to life.  The report of the Secretary-General to the 
General Assembly on the draft Covenant identified three views that had been advanced during 
the drafting of ICCPR.  The first was that the right to life should be expressed in absolute terms </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and that &#8220;no mention should be made of circumstances under which the taking of life might seem 
to be condoned&#8221;.<b>88</b>  This view was widely rejected as unrealistic in the context of a binding legal 
instrument.<b>89</b>  The second view was that the provision should &#8220;spell out specifically the 
circumstances in which the taking of life would not be deemed a violation of the general 
obligation to protect life&#8221;,<b>90</b> and a number of detailed enumerations of exceptions were provided 
by those holding this view.  Others considered, however, that even if agreement could be reached 
on each particular exception, &#8220;any enumeration of limitations would necessarily be 
incomplete&#8221;.<b>91</b>  The third view - which prevailed - was that a general formulation should be 
adopted that provided a principled basis for distinguishing permissible and impermissible 
deprivations of life.<b>92</b> 
</p>
<p>46. The approach adopted was that only one exception - the death penalty - would be 
expressly specified.  It was considered that the concepts of arbitrariness and of the most serious 
crimes, while complex, were nonetheless accessible to legal reasoning.<b>93</b>  It was noted, 
moreover, that inasmuch as they had juridical meaning, these concepts could be clarified and 
given precision through subsequent jurisprudence.  It was submitted that the views of the body 
established to implement ICCPR, the Human Rights Committee, along with the comments of 
States and the consideration of world public opinion would clarify these concepts as concrete 
cases arose.<b>94</b> 
</p>
<p>47. In essence this is the same approach that has been used in relation to all of the terms 
which have required jurisprudential development in order to give operational clarity to the norms 
of human rights law, many of which are inevitably and sometimes intentionally relatively 
open-ended.  The evolving jurisprudence in relation to the terms &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; and &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221; has developed along two tracks.  First, the evaluation of particular sentencing schemes 
has facilitated incremental clarification without requiring attempts to arrive at an exhaustive 
enumeration.  Second, expert and intergovernmental bodies that have had the time to focus on 
the concept in light of the whole corpus of international human rights law have proven capable 
of more precisely defining the scope of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; in terms of general principles.  
Moreover, there has been a fruitful interaction between the two modes of jurisprudential 
development.<b>95</b> 
</p>
<p>48. The first major attempt to clarify the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; provision on the level of 
principle was that undertaken by the Economic and Social Council in the early 1980s, resulting 
in the safeguards.  These were drafted by the Committee on Crime Prevention and Control of the 
Council.  Its preliminary draft included a provision specifying that, &#8220;Capital punishment may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes.&#8221;  At the Council&#8217;s request, the Secretary-General 
commented on that draft.  He noted the &#8220;persistent disparity in the number of offences liable to 
the death penalty&#8221; and observed that the norm remained &#8220;unclear and open to differing 
interpretations&#8221;.  As a result, he proposed the following reformulation in order that article 6 (2) 
of ICCPR and article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights &#8220;may be properly 
applied&#8221;: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Capital punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, it being 
understood that their scope should be limited to intentional lethal offences.  Accordingly, 
it should be excluded for offences which are considered to be of a merely political nature, 
or for cases in which the political nature of the offence exceeds its criminal aspects.&#8221;<b>96</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49. The provision ultimately adopted by the Economic and Social Council and the 
General Assembly largely adopted this approach: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, capital punishment may be 
imposed only for the most serious crimes, it being understood that their scope should not 
go beyond intentional crimes with lethal or other extremely grave consequences.&#8221;<b>97</b> 
</p>
<p>50. The safeguards drafted by the Committee were adopted by the Economic and Social 
Council and subsequently by the General Assembly,<b>98</b> and the Secretary-General was requested 
by the Council to report on the implementation of the safeguards by States.<b>99</b>  The reports of the 
Secretary-General have clarified the meaning accorded in practice to the phrase &#8220;intentional 
crimes with lethal or other extremely grave consequences&#8221;.  While noting that it has given rise to 
&#8220;wide interpretation by a number of countries&#8221;, the Secretary-General concluded that &#8220;the 
meaning of intentional crimes and of lethal or other extremely grave consequences is intended to 
imply that the offences should be life-threatening, in the sense that this is a very likely 
consequence of the action&#8221;.<b>100</b> 
</p>
<p>51. With respect to particular offences, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
Rights Committee have determined that a wide range of specific offences fall outside the scope 
of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; for which the death penalty may be imposed.<b>101</b>  These include:  
abduction not resulting in death,<b>102</b> abetting suicide,<b>103</b> adultery,<b>104</b> apostasy,<b>105</b> corruption,<b>106</b> 
drug-related offences,<b>107</b> economic crimes,<b>108</b> the expression of conscience,<b>109</b> financial crimes,<b>110</b> 
embezzlement by officials,<b>111</b> evasion of military service,<b>112</b> homosexual acts,<b>113</b> illicit sex,<b>114</b> 
sexual relations between consenting adults,<b>115</b> theft or robbery by force,<b>116</b> religious practice,<b>117</b> 
and political offences.<b>118</b>  The last of these has presented particular complexities, inasmuch as 
offences against the State or the political order are often drawn broadly so as to encompass both 
non-serious and very serious crimes and ambiguously so as to leave the Government discretion 
in defining the offence.  Instances in which the Committee has expressed concern that offences 
carrying the death penalty are &#8220;excessively vague&#8221;,<b>119</b> &#8220;imprecise&#8221;,<b>120</b> &#8220;loosely defined&#8221;,<b>121</b> &#8220;so 
broad [as to encompass] a wide range of acts of differing gravity&#8221;,<b>122</b> or &#8220;couched in terms so 
broad that the imposition of the death penalty may be subject to essentially subjective criteria&#8221;<b>123</b> 
have included legislation regarding &#8220;opposition to order and national security violations&#8221;,<b>124</b> 
&#8220;attacks against the internal security of the State&#8221;<b>125</b>, &#8220;categories of offences relating to internal 
and external security&#8221;,<b>126</b> &#8220;secession, espionage or incitement to war&#8221;,<b>127</b> a broadly written 
definition of terrorism,<b>128</b> and various other political offences.<b>129</b> 
</p>
<p>52. The Human Rights Committee has reached conclusions regarding the principled content 
of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; provision that are consistent with, and give further refinement to, 
those expressed in the safeguards and the comments of the Secretary-General.  In one of its 
earliest general comments, the Committee observed that:  &#8220;[t]he deprivation of life by the 
authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity.  Therefore, the law must strictly control 
and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by such authorities . ... 
The Committee is of the opinion that the expression &#8216;most serious crimes&#8217; must be read 
restrictively to mean that the death penalty should be a quite exceptional measure.&#8221;<b>130</b>  This 
analysis has been greatly refined over the ensuing decades through the insights provided by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>dealing with the host of concrete situations discussed above, and a review of its jurisprudence 
today suggests more precise conclusions.  First, the Committee has thus far only found cases 
involving murder not to raise concerns under the most serious crimes provision.<b>131</b>  Second, it 
has consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for offences that do not result in the 
loss of life.<b>132</b>  Third, the Committee&#8217;s conclusion that the death penalty may not be mandatory 
even for murder suggests that a most serious offence must involve, at a minimum, intentional 
acts of violence resulting in the death of a person.<b>133</b>  Indeed, the Committee and the 
Commission have rejected nearly every imaginable category of offence other than murder as 
falling outside the ambit of the most serious crimes.   
</p>
<p>53. The conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence 
of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting these provisions is that the 
death penalty can only be imposed in such a way that it complies with the stricture that it must be 
limited to the most serious crimes, in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to 
kill which resulted in the loss of life. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The prohibition of the mandatory death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur has addressed communications to a number of Governments 
noting that legislation dictating the mandatory imposition of the death penalty is prohibited under 
international human rights law.  This section more fully elaborates the law underpinning that 
prohibition.<b>134</b>  The view of the Special Rapporteur has been informed by, and is generally 
consistent with, the approach adopted by almost every judicial or quasi-judicial human rights 
body in the world.  This includes, in particular, the Commission on Human Rights<b>135</b> and the 
Human Rights Committee.  In addition, the same approach has been adopted by a wide range of 
national courts and other judicial bodies such as the Privy Council.<b>136</b>  The legal reasoning 
underpinning these views is thus highly persuasive when it comes to interpreting international 
human rights norms, whether they be based on treaty or customary law.<b>137</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The intuitive argument against the mandatory death penalty is strong - surely, a human 
facing death merits a chance to present reasons why he or she should be allowed to live - but 
some still contend that this opportunity may be denied.  The principal argument that has been 
advanced in favour of the compatibility of mandatory death sentences with international 
human rights law has been that, insofar as an offence carrying such a penalty covers only the 
&#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, all of the facts legally relevant to the permissibility of such a sentence 
will be considered in the course of obtaining a conviction.  To this it has been added that other 
factors relevant to a sense of justice will be considered should the convict exercise his or her 
&#8220;right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence&#8221;.<b>138</b>  However, the key insight that has 
emerged from the approach adopted by the world&#8217;s human rights bodies has been that the 
proper application of human rights law - especially of its provisions that &#8220;[n]o one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his life&#8221;<b>139</b> and that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to &#8230; cruel, inhuman or 
degrading &#8230; punishment&#8221;<b>140</b> - requires weighing factors that will not be taken into account in the 
process of determining whether a defendant is guilty of committing a &#8220;most serious crime&#8221;.<b>141</b>  
As a result, these factors can only be taken into account in the context of individualized 
sentencing by the judiciary in death penalty cases.<b>142</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. The understanding that mandatory death sentences are per se violations of human rights 
law originates in the efforts of a number of judicial and quasi-judicial bodies to distinguish 
between mandatory death penalty laws that respected human rights and those that did not.  Each 
began by attempting to discern whether a particular offence for which the death penalty was 
mandatory was sufficiently narrowly drawn that anyone convicted of that offence could justly 
receive the death penalty.  The process of pursuing this case-by-case approach led to the 
conclusion that even if the offence had been drafted to cover only the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, 
there would invariably be other factors regarding each individual case that would be relevant to 
the legal determination of whether a death sentence would be consistent with also upholding the 
defendant&#8217;s human rights.<b>143</b>  The conclusion, in theory as well as in practice, was that respect 
for human rights can be reliably ensured in death penalty cases only if the judiciary engages in 
case-specific, individualized sentencing that accounts for all of the relevant factors.<b>144</b> 
</p>
<p>57. The Human Rights Committee&#8217;s first consideration of the mandatory death penalty 
turned on the requirement of ICCPR that a &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most 
serious crimes&#8221;.<b>145</b>  In <i>Lubuto v. Zambia</i> the applicant had been sentenced to death pursuant to a 
law that made the death sentence mandatory for the offence of aggravated robbery in which 
firearms were used.  The Committee concluded that the offence was defined in an overinclusive 
manner because it included crimes that &#8220;did not produce the death or wounding of any 
person&#8221;.<b>146</b>  Because some of the crimes covered by the offence were not among the most 
serious, a mandatory death sentence was inappropriate.  This was not a finding that mandatory 
death sentences inherently violate international law.  Although the mandatory death penalty in 
question was unacceptable, the Committee&#8217;s tacit view was that its defects could be remedied by 
a legislative amendment that would draw an additional distinction in its codification of the 
offence. </p>
<p>58. Subsequent cases persuaded the Committee that no such solution was viable in  
practice.  In other words, legislative classifications are inherently overinclusive and that  
reliable proportionality is achievable only through individualized sentencing.<b>147</b>  <i>Thompson v. 
Saint Vincent</i> concerned a mandatory death sentence for murder, which was defined to include 
only &#8220;intentional acts of violence resulting in the death of a person&#8221;.<b>148</b>  The Committee found 
that the mandatory death sentence was &#8220;arbitrary&#8221;, even in these circumstances, because it would 
be arbitrary for the court not to consider the &#8220;defendant&#8217;s personal circumstances&#8221; and the 
&#8220;circumstances of the particular offence&#8221; in order to ascertain &#8220;whether this exceptional form of 
punishment is appropriate &#8230;&#8221;.<b>149</b>  In <i>Kennedy v. Trinidad and Tobago</i>, the Committee went even 
further when it found a mandatory death sentence for murder, defined to include &#8220;situations 
where a person commits a felony involving personal violence and where this violence results 
even inadvertently in the death of the victim&#8221;, to violate the prohibition on arbitrary deprivation 
of life.<b>150</b>  The problem identified by the Committee in this and subsequent cases was not that an 
individual was being sentenced to death for a crime that was not among the most serious.  
Rather, it was that conviction for a most serious crime was not per se sufficient to satisfy other 
requirements of human rights law.<b>151</b> 
</p>
<p>59. The same logical path - from testing offences carrying a mandatory death sentence for 
overinclusiveness to requiring individualized sentencing - has been followed by a number of 
other judicial organs, including the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council<b>152</b> and the 
Supreme Court of India.  The latter found in <i>Mithu</i> that the sheer range of scenarios in which </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>idiosyncratic circumstances would make the death penalty permissible for one, but 
impermissible for another in superficially similar circumstances demonstrated the  
impossibility of a just mandatory death penalty, concluding that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to be remembered that the measure of punishment for an offence is not afforded 
by the label which that offence bears, as for example &#8216;Theft&#8217;, &#8216;Breach of Trust&#8217; or 
&#8216;Murder&#8217;.  The gravity of the offence furnishes the guideline for punishment and one 
cannot determine how grave the offence is without having regard to the circumstances in 
which it was committed, its motivation and its repercussions.  The legislature cannot 
make relevant circumstances irrelevant, deprive courts of their legitimate jurisdiction to 
exercise their discretion not to impose the death sentence in appropriate cases, compel 
them to shut their eyes to mitigating circumstances and inflict upon them the dubious and 
unconscionable duty of imposing a preordained sentence of death. &#8230;  A standardized 
mandatory sentence, and that too in the form of a sentence of death, fails to take into 
account the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  It is those facts and 
circumstances which constitute a safe guideline for determining the question of sentence 
in each individual case.  The infinite variety of cases and facets to each would make 
general standards either meaningless &#8216;boiler plate&#8217; or a statement of the obvious. &#8230;  The 
task performed by the legislature while enacting [mandatory death penalty legislation] is 
beyond even the present human ability &#8230; .&#8221;<b>153</b> 
</p>
<p>60. The approach uniformly shared by international human rights bodies is entirely consistent 
with the Court&#8217;s conclusion that &#8220;law ceases to have respect and relevance when it compels the 
dispensers of justice to deliver blind verdicts by decreeing that no matter what the circumstances 
of the crime, the criminal shall be hanged by the neck until he is dead&#8221;.<b>154</b> 
</p>
<p>61. Such a conclusion could only be rejected were one to reject the long-standing 
jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee that the right to life is the &#8220;supreme right&#8221; and 
that &#8220;the deprivation of life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity&#8221;.  
Accordingly, &#8220;the law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be 
deprived of his life by such authorities&#8221;.<b>155</b>  It has thus been consistently found in practice that 
permitting mandatory death sentences makes it inevitable that some persons will be sentenced to 
death even though that sentence is disproportionate to the facts of their crimes.  Whatever 
inexactitude might be tolerated in determining the size of a fine or the length of a sentence in 
years, uncertainty in the decision between life and death is incompatible with the strict control 
with which the law must protect the right to life.  As the Supreme Court of the United States held 
when ending that country&#8217;s use of the mandatory death penalty: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the penalty of death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment, however 
long.  Death, in its finality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100-year prison 
term differs from one of only a year or two.  Because of that qualitative difference, there 
is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is 
the appropriate punishment in a specific case&#8221;.<b>156</b> 
</p>
<p>62. It is clear, therefore, that in death penalty cases, individualized sentencing by the 
judiciary is required to prevent cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and the arbitrary 
deprivation of life. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The prohibition of the execution of those who were under 18 at the time of 
committing a crime is of fundamental importance to international human rights law.  The 
Islamic Republic of Iran is the only country in the world in relation to which I continue to 
receive significant numbers of credible reports of such sentences being imposed and, in 
some cases, carried out on juveniles.  Iran is a party to two treaties which explicitly outlaw 
this practice.  My repeated requests over several years to visit Iran in order to ascertain the 
accuracy of these reports and to explore through dialogue ways in which to remedy any 
shortcomings have yielded no response.  This is despite the fact that a &#8220;standing invitation&#8221; 
has been issued.  This is now a matter in relation to which the Council will need to respond 
appropriately.</b> 
</p>
<p>64.<b> International human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary bodies of law.  Suggestions that the extrajudicial executions mandate and, 
much more importantly, the Human Rights Council as a whole are excluded from 
inquiring into possible violations of human rights or humanitarian law committed in any 
context in which an armed conflict may or may not be occurring would dramatically 
reduce the relevance of the Council and would eliminate all public scrutiny under 
international law for such violations.  The Council should uphold and continue its very 
long-established practice - dating back almost a quarter of a century in the case of this 
mandate alone - of scrutinizing alleged violations of both human rights and humanitarian 
law, even if committed in the context of an armed conflict.</b> 
</p>
<p>65.<b> The death penalty must, under international law, only be applied for the most 
serious crimes.  This standard, like all others in international human rights law, cannot be 
interpreted subjectively by each individual country without making a mockery of the basic 
principle.  Over the past two decades international jurisprudence from a wide range of 
sources has succeeded in bringing clarity to the question of which crimes can legitimately 
be classified as being the &#8220;most serious&#8221;.  As a result, the death penalty can only be 
imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in 
the loss of life.</b> 
</p>
<p>66.<b> Making the death penalty mandatory for certain crimes, in such a way that a judge 
is prohibited from taking the circumstances of an individual accused person into account in 
sentencing, is illegal under international human rights law.  This is not to say that countries 
which retain the death penalty are unable to apply that penalty in the majority of cases 
involving a most serious crime, but they are obligated to at least provide for the possibility 
that a judge might find a death sentence impermissible in a particular individual's case 
because of extenuating circumstances of one kind or another.</b> </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>NOTES TO THE REPORT 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The term &#8220;extrajudicial executions&#8221; is used in this report to refer to executions other than those 
</p>
<p>carried out by the State in conformity with the law.  As explained in my previous report &#8220;[t]he 
terms of reference of this mandate are not best understood through efforts to define individually 
the terms &#8216;extrajudicial&#8217;, &#8216;summary&#8217; or &#8216;arbitrary&#8217;, or to seek to categorize any given incident 
accordingly&#8221;.  Rather, &#8220;the most productive focus is on the mandate itself, as it has evolved over 
the years through the various resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 6).

30 September 2006, and responses received from Governments between 1 December 2005  
and 1 December 2006.  A comprehensive account of communications sent to Governments up to 
1 December 2006, along with replies received up to the end of January 2007, and the relevant 
observations of the Special Rapporteur, are reflected in addendum 1 to this report.

<p>  <i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, E/CN.4/1997/60, para. 91:  &#8220;[The <i>Safeguards</i> state that] the scope of crimes subject 
to the death penalty should not go beyond intentional crimes with lethal or other extremely grave 
consequences.  The Special Rapporteur concludes from this, that the death penalty should be 
eliminated for crimes such as economic crimes and drug-related offences.  In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur wishes to express his concern that certain countries, namely China, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the United States of America, 
maintain in their national legislation the option to impose the death penalty for economic and/or 
drug-related offences.&#8221;

a Dutch proposal that Art. 6 be drafted along the same lines as Art. 2 of the ECHR, the majority 
insisted on the formulation adopted by the HRComm, even though its meaning had not been 
clarified.  Several delegates took the opinion that arbitrarily was synonymous with the term 
&#8216;without due process of law&#8217; common in Anglo-American law.  Others argued that it contained 
an ethical component, since national legislation could also be arbitrary.  The Committee of 
Experts, which had taken up the interpretation of this term at the request of the Committee of 
Ministers of the Council of Europe, concurred with the view of the Chilean delegate in the 
HRComm that arbitrary deprivation of life contained elements of <i>unlawfulness</i> and <i>injustice</i>, as

provisions of the present Covenant and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide&#8221; indicates another key limitation on what may constitute a capital crime.

<p>Under international law, each individual may as of right exercise liberty of movement; choose 
his or her own residence; leave any country; enjoy individual and family privacy; think freely,

conduct of public affairs; to vote, and to stand as a candidate for election.  ICCPR, arts. 12, 17, 
18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25.  The exercise of these and other human rights cannot be punished with 
death; indeed, such conduct cannot be punished at all.  Even when the enjoyment of a right might 
be subjected to a legitimate limitation or derogation, its exercise cannot be considered to rise to 
the level of a &#8220;most serious crime&#8221; for which the death penalty might be imposed.  <i>See also</i>

of the most serious crimes.  The term &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; was &#8220;criticized as lacking precision&#8221; 
and some suggested the explicit exclusion of particular categories of offences from the concept.

subsequently be possible to supplement the covenant in the light of that jurisprudence.&#8221;  The 
sense of this observation was clarified by the delegate&#8217;s observation that the list of particular 
non-arbitrary deprivations of life proposed by some for inclusion in the text of the ICCPR would, 
despite its exclusion, &#8220;form one of the basic elements in any jurisprudence of that sort.&#8221;

</b>  A particularly significant example is that the recognition that mandatory death sentences were

<p><i>per se</i> violations of human rights law stemmed from a gradual understanding through the 
adjudication of concrete cases that the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; limitation did not fully capture the

Additional insights are provided by the views of the European Union.  After reviewing the 
resolutions of the GA and the provisions of the ICCPR and the <i>Safeguards</i>, in its <i>Guidelines to 
EU Policy Towards Third Countries on the Death Penalty</i>, the European Council determined 
that, among the minimum standards that should be met by all States maintaining the death 
penalty, is: 
</p>
<p>Capital punishment may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, it being  
understood that their scope should not go beyond intentional crimes with lethal or  
other extremely grave consequences.  The death penalty should not be imposed for 
non-violent financial crimes or for non-violent religious practice or expression of 
conscience.  (<i>Guidelines to EU Policy Towards Third Countries on the Death Penalty</i>  
(3 June 1988), <i>at </i>http://www.eurunion.org/legislat/DeathPenalty/Guidelines.htm.) 
</p>
<p>In keeping with the <i>erga omnes</i> character of the right to life, the EU has elected to make 
d&#233;marches to non-EU countries regarding practices deviating from this and other minimum 
standards.  (<i>See</i> Roger Hood, <i>The Death Penalty:  A Worldwide Perspective</i> (3rd ed. 2002),

communication&#8217;s author &#8220;to a real risk of a violation of Article 6, paragraph 2 [of the ICCPR]&#8221; in 
the destination country, and it did not find a violation where the crime in question was murder.

<p><b>136
</b>  The first national court to strike down the mandatory death penalty as a violation of rights 
</p>
<p>was that of the United States Supreme Court in 1976.  <i>Woodson et al. v. North Carolina</i>,  
428 U.S. 280 (1976); <i>Sumner v. Shuman</i>, 483 U.S. 66 (1987) (clarifying that the holding in 
<i>Woodson</i> did not have exceptions).  The Supreme Court of India invalidated that country&#8217;s  
last remaining mandatory death penalty law in 1983, and the Constitutional Court of Uganda 
followed suit in 2005.  <i>Mithu v. State of Pubjab</i>, 2 S.C.R. 690 (1983); <i>Susan Kigula and  
416 others v. Attorney General</i>, Constitutional Petition No. 6 of 2003, Judgement of  
10 June 2005. 
</p>
<p>Influenced by the reasoning of the US and Indian decisions, international treaty bodies began 
contributing to the jurisprudence in the mid-1990s.  The HRC first found a mandatory death 
penalty law incompatible with the ICCPR in 1995 and did so in more general terms in 2000.  
<i>Lubuto v. Zambia</i>, Human Rights Committee, No. 390/1990 (1995); <i>Thompson v. Saint Vincent</i>, 
Human Rights Committee, No. 806/1998 (2000).  The Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights reached the same conclusion in 1999.  <i>Rudolph Baptiste v. Grenada</i>, Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, Case 11.743, Report No. 38/00 (1999).  The Inter-American 
Court of Human rights confirmed this jurisprudence in 2002.  <i>Hilaire, Constantine and Benjamin</i> 
et al. <i>v. Trinidad and Tobago</i>, Series C, No. 94 (21 June 2002). 
</p>
<p>The most influential recent judgements have been those of the Judicial Committee of the  
Privy Council.  The Privy Council first considered the constitutionality of a mandatory death 
penalty law in <i>Ong Ah Chuan</i> <i>v. Public Prosecutor </i>(1980) and found that law constitutional.   
<i>Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor</i> (1980) 3 WLR 855 (Privy Council; appeals from the Court 
of Criminal Appeals of Singapore).  However, in subsequent cases the Privy Council has rejected 
this line of reasoning and established that the mandatory death penalty is incompatible with 
human rights.  The question of whether the mandatory death penalty violated individual 
human rights was settled by 2002.  <i>Reyes v. The Queen</i> [2002] 2 App. Cas. 235 (P.C.), 
judgement of 11 March 2002 (Belize); <i>Queen v. Hughes</i> [2002] 2 App. Cas. 259 (P.C.), 
judgement of March 2002; <i>Fox v. The Queen</i> [2002] 2 App. Cas. 284 (P.C.), judgement of 
March 2002.  <i>See also </i>Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal, <i>Spence and Hughes v. The Queen</i>, 
Crim. App. Nos. 20 of 1998 and 14 of 1997, judgement of 2 April 2001.  Later cases have 
primarily concerned questions of whether those rights were enforceable under particular 
constitutional schemes.  <i>See</i> Joanna Harrington, <i>The Challenge to the Mandatory Death Penalty 
in the Commonwealth Caribbean</i>, American Journal of International Law, Vol. 98, No. 1 
(January 2004), pp. 126-140.  In a 2006 case, the Privy Council noted that the evolution of its 
jurisprudence was due not to the changing content of the law but to the gradual process by which 
judges came to understand that law:  &#8220;It is &#8230; clear that it took some time for the legal effect of 
entrenched human rights guarantees to be appreciated, not because the meaning of the rights 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>changed but because the jurisprudence on human rights and constitutional adjudication was 
unfamiliar and, by some courts, resisted.&#8221;  <i>Bowe v. The Queen</i>, Privy Council Appeal No. 44

sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.&#8221;

<p>  The relevance of a range of factors has been noted by judicial and quasi-judicial bodies.  
<i>See</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Thompson v. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</i>, Communication No. 806/1998 (2000), 
para. 8 (&#8220;defendant&#8217;s personal circumstances&#8221; and the &#8220;circumstances of the particular 
offence&#8221;); <i>Hilaire, Constantine and Benjamin</i> et al. <i>v. Trinidad and Tobago</i>, Series C, No. 94 
(21 June 2002), para. 87 (&#8220;prior criminal record of the offender&#8221;, &#8220;the subjective factors that 
could have motivated his conduct&#8221;, &#8220;the degree of his participation in the criminal act&#8221;, &#8220;the 
probability that the offender could be reformed and socially readapted&#8221;, &#8220;whether the death 
penalty is the appropriate punishment or not for the specific case in light of the circumstances of 
the offender&#8217;s conduct&#8221;).

<p>  While this explanation of the reasoning behind these cases is somewhat stylized, it clarifies 
far more than it obscures.

<p>  The distinction between evaluating general legislation and individual sentences under human 
rights law can also be understood as an example of the difference between &#8220;macro-policy at the 
central level&#8221; and the &#8220;micro-policy of specific law enforcement bodies&#8221;.  <i>See</i> Liu Renwen, 
&#8220;Strict Restriction on Death Penalty and its Paths in China&#8221; <i>in</i> <i>The Road to the Abolition of the 
Death Penalty in China:  Regarding the Abolition of the Non-Violent Crime at the Present Stage</i>

<p>  The logical structure of the conclusion reached by these various judicial and quasi-judicial 
bodies was clearly stated by the Privy Council in Bowe in the following syllogism: 
</p>
<p> (1) It is a fundamental principle of just sentencing that the punishment imposed on a 
convicted defendant should be proportionate to the gravity of the crime of which he has been 
convicted; 
</p>
<p> (2) The criminal culpability of those convicted of murder varies very widely; 
</p>
<p> (3) Not all those convicted of murder deserve to die.
