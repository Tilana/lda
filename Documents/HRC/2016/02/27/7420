<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, submits the 
</p>
<p>present report in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 19/6. 
</p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur examines copyright law and policy 
</p>
<p>from the perspective of the right to science and culture, emphasizing both the need for 
</p>
<p>protection of authorship and expanding opportunities for participation in cultural life.  
</p>
<p>Recalling that protection of authorship differs from copyright protection, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur proposes several tools to advance the human rights interests of authors.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also proposes to expand copyright exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations to empower new creativity, enhance rewards to authors, increase educational 
</p>
<p>opportunities, preserve space for non-commercial culture and promote inclusion and access 
</p>
<p>to cultural works.  
</p>
<p>An equally important recommendation is to promote cultural and scientific 
</p>
<p>participation by encouraging the use of open licences, such as those offered by Creative 
</p>
<p>Commons.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. Science and culture are not only of great importance to the knowledge economy;1 
</p>
<p>they are also fundamental to human dignity and autonomy. 
</p>
<p>2. In that area, two influential paradigms of international law &#8212; intellectual property 
</p>
<p>and human rights &#8212; have evolved largely separately.  
</p>
<p>3. Recent developments, however, have rendered the interface of those two regimes 
</p>
<p>more salient. Since the 1990s, a new wave of international intellectual property treaties has 
</p>
<p>increased the tension between intellectual property and human rights standards. In 2000, the 
</p>
<p>Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights adopted a resolution 
</p>
<p>on intellectual property and human rights calling for the primacy of human rights over trade 
</p>
<p>law (resolution 2000/7). Since then, public interest groups and developing countries have 
</p>
<p>gradually aligned in an &#8220;access to knowledge&#8221; movement seeking to rebalance international 
</p>
<p>intellectual property governance.2 Asserting that &#8220;humanity faces a global crisis in the 
</p>
<p>governance of knowledge, technology and culture,&#8221; the 2005 Geneva Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) called for renewed attention 
</p>
<p>to alternative policy approaches to promote innovation and creativity without the social 
</p>
<p>costs of privatization.3 Increasing attention given to the rights of indigenous peoples has 
</p>
<p>also provided impetus to approaching intellectual property policy from a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective.4 
</p>
<p>4. Significant uncertainty remains, nonetheless, on how to resolve the potential 
</p>
<p>tensions between intellectual property laws and human rights. The right to science and 
</p>
<p>culture &#8212; understood as encompassing the right to take part in cultural life, to enjoy the 
</p>
<p>benefits of scientific progress and its applications, and the right to benefit from the 
</p>
<p>protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or 
</p>
<p>artistic production of which a person is the author &#8212; offers a particularly promising 
</p>
<p>framework for reconciliation.5 Both intellectual property systems and the right to science 
</p>
<p>and culture obligate governments &#8220;to recognize and reward human creativity and 
</p>
<p>innovation and, at the same time, to ensure public access to the fruits of those endeavours. 
</p>
<p>Striking the appropriate balance between these two goals is the central challenge that both 
</p>
<p>regimes share&#8221;.6 Moreover and importantly, both cultural participation and protection of 
</p>
<p>authorship are human rights principles designed to work in tandem. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur organized an open consultation on 6 June 2014 to elicit the 
</p>
<p>views of States and other stakeholders on the impact of intellectual property regimes on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to science and culture. She also convened experts&#8217; meetings on 10 
</p>
<p>and 11 June 2014 in Geneva, Switzerland, and 28 October 2014 at New York University, 
</p>
<p>United States of America (see annex). Numerous contributions were also received from 
</p>
<p>States and stakeholders and are available online. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all 
</p>
<p>those who contributed.

<p>6. The present report is the first of two consecutive studies by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on intellectual property policy as it relates to the right to science and culture. This first 
</p>
<p>report focuses on the interface of copyright policy with the protection of authors&#8217; moral and 
</p>
<p>material interests and the public&#8217;s right to benefit from scientific and cultural creativity. A 
</p>
<p>second report, to be submitted to the General Assembly in 2015, will examine the 
</p>
<p>connection between the right to science and culture and patent policy. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International and national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to science and culture  
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to science and culture is recognized in various human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p>such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>8. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration provides for everyone&#8217;s right (1) &#8220;freely to 
</p>
<p>participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific 
</p>
<p>advancement and its benefits,&#8221; and to (2) &#8220;the protection of the moral and material interests 
</p>
<p>resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>9. These dual aspects of cultural participation and protection of authorship are included 
</p>
<p>in all later articulations of the right to science and culture, including article 15, paragraph 1, 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Covenant 
</p>
<p>further echoes the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Organization (UNESCO), highlighting the touchstone principles of conservation, 
</p>
<p>development and diffusion of science and culture, freedom as an essential precondition for 
</p>
<p>the realization of the right to science and culture and the importance of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation to achieve that right (art. 15, paras. 2, 3 and 4). 
</p>
<p>10. The right to science and culture is also enshrined in several regional human rights 
</p>
<p>conventions and in many national constitutions, often alongside a commitment to the 
</p>
<p>protection of intellectual property. 
</p>
<p>11. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has drawn up interpretive 
</p>
<p>guidance pertaining to some aspects of the right to science and culture.  
</p>
<p>12. Protection of authorship is the subject of the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 17 
</p>
<p>(2005) on the right of everyone to benefit from the protection of the moral and material 
</p>
<p>interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he or she is 
</p>
<p>the author, which distinguishes between intellectual property rights and human rights, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing that the moral and material interests of authors do not necessarily coincide 
</p>
<p>with the prevailing approach to intellectual property law. The Comment ties the &#8220;material 
</p>
<p>interests&#8221; of authors to the ability of creators to enjoy an adequate standard of living and 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that authors&#8217; rights should be protected in ways that do not unduly burden 
</p>
<p>cultural participation. 
</p>
<p>13. Addressing cultural participation, the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 21 (2009) 
</p>
<p>on the right of everyone to take part in cultural life emphasizes the importance of cultural 
</p>
<p>diversity and being able to engage with and contribute to the cultural life of the broader 
</p>
<p>community. 
</p>
<p>14. The right of everyone to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications 
</p>
<p>has not yet been the subject of a general comment. However, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2012 
</p>
<p>thematic report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/20/26) addressed the tensions 
</p>
<p>between the right to benefit from scientific progress and its applications and intellectual </p>


<p>property regimes. This report emphasizes human knowledge as a global public good and 
</p>
<p>recommends that States should guard against promoting the privatization of knowledge to 
</p>
<p>an extent that deprives individuals of opportunities to take part in cultural life and enjoy the 
</p>
<p>fruits of scientific progress (ibid., para. 65). 
</p>
<p><b> B. International regulation of copyright  
</b></p>
<p>15. &#8220;Intellectual property&#8221; is an umbrella term encompassing a number of distinct legal 
</p>
<p>regimes that create private property rights related to intangible assets. Specific legal 
</p>
<p>regimes pertaining to copyrights, patents, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, etc., 
</p>
<p>each regulate different forms of intellectual property, defining the types of creations it 
</p>
<p>applies to, the rules for determining whether specific material qualifies for legal protection 
</p>
<p>and which types of conduct will be considered to infringe the owner&#8217;s exclusive rights, and 
</p>
<p>establishing the legal penalties for such acts.  
</p>
<p>16. Legal protection of copyright interests originated in Europe centuries ago at the 
</p>
<p>municipal and national levels. Because printing press technology enabled mass 
</p>
<p>reproduction of written materials, those laws originally related to the reprinting of books 
</p>
<p>and sheet music. As technology advanced, other genres such as visual art and musical 
</p>
<p>performances, came to be included.  
</p>
<p>17. Bilateral agreements between European States constitute the first supranational law-
</p>
<p>making on copyright. The 1886 multilateral Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary 
</p>
<p>and Artistic Works was initially signed by fewer than a dozen countries; nevertheless, its 
</p>
<p>geographic sweep was significant as it also applied to the colonies of signatory nations. 
</p>
<p>Today, the Berne Convention has 168 contracting parties. In 1994, the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization (WTO) announced its Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Rights (TRIPS). Incorporating most elements of the Berne Convention by 
</p>
<p>reference, the TRIPS Agreement establishes a new enforcement mechanism based on 
</p>
<p>international dispute resolution and trade sanctions. It applies to all WTO members, 
</p>
<p>although least developed countries have until at least 2021 to comply. 
</p>
<p>18. The Berne Convention and TRIPS Agreement are supplemented by several 
</p>
<p>international conventions regulating copyright and related rights, administered by WIPO. 
</p>
<p>The International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms 
</p>
<p>and Broadcasting Organizations was agreed in 1961; the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the 
</p>
<p>WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, jointly known as the Internet Treaties, in 
</p>
<p>1996. International law-making on the topic of copyright continues within WIPO, as well as 
</p>
<p>through bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.  
</p>
<p>19. Considerable concern is expressed today about an apparent democratic deficit in 
</p>
<p>international policymaking on copyright. Of particular concern is the tendency for trade 
</p>
<p>negotiations to be conducted amid great secrecy, with substantial corporate participation 
</p>
<p>but without an equivalent participation of elected officials and other public interest voices. 
</p>
<p>For example, the recent negotiations around the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement and 
</p>
<p>the Trans-Pacific Partnership have involved a few countries negotiating substantial 
</p>
<p>commitments on copyright policy, without the benefit of public participation and debate. In 
</p>
<p>contrast, treaty negotiations in WIPO forums are characterized by greater openness, 
</p>
<p>participation, and consensus-building. Regardless of the forum, concern is often expressed 
</p>
<p>that powerful parties may use international rule-making to restrict domestic policy options, 
</p>
<p>advancing private interests at the expense of public welfare or human rights. </p>


<p><b> C. Overview of domestic copyright laws  
</b></p>
<p>20. Within the boundaries set by international treaties, States retain the discretion to 
</p>
<p>adopt their own copyright laws. The present section summarizes the basic common points 
</p>
<p>found in national copyright regimes.  
</p>
<p>21. Copyright or &#8220;authors&#8217; rights&#8221;7 applies to all literary, artistic and scientific works: 
</p>
<p>from newspapers to books, blogs, music, dance, paintings, sculptures, movies, scientific 
</p>
<p>articles and computer software. Copyright restricts the ability of third parties to use 
</p>
<p>copyrighted works without securing permission from the copyright holder. Of note, 
</p>
<p>copyright does not provide any ownership over facts, ideas and news, although a unique 
</p>
<p>expression of such material would enjoy protection from copying of its unique expressive 
</p>
<p>elements. Because a copyright may be bought and sold, the copyright holder may be a party 
</p>
<p>other than the original author, such as a publisher. Copyright protection is thus fundamental 
</p>
<p>to the system of licensing and payment for access to creative works that drive various 
</p>
<p>cultural industries. 
</p>
<p>22. Copyright laws prohibit much more than literal copying. It is generally also illegal to 
</p>
<p>translate, publicly perform, distribute, adapt or modify a copyrighted work without 
</p>
<p>permission. For example, rearranging a piece of music in a new style, translating a poem 
</p>
<p>into a new language, or converting a book into a play, would all be considered copyright 
</p>
<p>infringements. Even when the second author contributes substantial new creativity, the 
</p>
<p>reuse or adaptation of a prior work generally requires a licence from the copyright holder. 
</p>
<p>The broad scope of those laws enables copyright holders to monetize a wide variety of uses 
</p>
<p>and to prevent adaptations they find objectionable. Consequently, the creative freedom of 
</p>
<p>other artists to build upon and adapt existing cultural works may become dependent upon 
</p>
<p>their ability to pay a licensing fee. 
</p>
<p>23. Partly in response to that concern, copyright laws also incorporate exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations, which preserve the freedom of other artists and the general public to use 
</p>
<p>copyrighted works in certain ways without the copyright holder&#8217;s permission.
 
National 
</p>
<p>practices regarding copyright exceptions and limitations vary significantly. Nearly every 
</p>
<p>country utilizes a list of specific, narrowly defined exceptions and limitations. The most 
</p>
<p>common example is an exception or limitation permitting an author or publisher to quote 
</p>
<p>small portions of another work in commentaries. Other examples may include permitting 
</p>
<p>consumers to make a backup copy of personal software, permitting teachers to make copies 
</p>
<p>of material for classroom use or permitting libraries to make copies for archiving and 
</p>
<p>preservation. In addition to specifically defined exceptions, some common-law countries 
</p>
<p>also employ a broad and flexible exception, which may be known as &#8220;fair use.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>24. Copyright protection applies automatically, as soon as an author creates a work, with 
</p>
<p>duration varying in different countries and according to the type of work. International 
</p>
<p>treaties generally require member States to guarantee the duration of copyright protection 
</p>
<p>for <i>at least</i> the author&#8217;s lifetime plus an additional 50 years after his/her death to the benefit 
</p>
<p>of the author&#8217;s heirs or the purchaser of the copyright.8 Some countries have accorded 
</p>
<p>copyright protection for 70, 80 or even 99 years after the creator&#8217;s demise. Consequently, 
</p>
<p>copyright protection often adheres for more than a century. Once that period expires, the 
</p>
<p>creative work enters the public domain for use by anyone without a licence.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 The present report follows the usage of the TRIPS Agreement in using the term &#8220;copyright&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>encompass all such national regimes, regardless of their domestic labels. 
</p>
<p> 8 Berne Convention, art. 7; TRIPS Agreement, arts. 9, para. 1, and 12. </p>


<p>25. To protect authors&#8217; interests in their reputations and the integrity of their creations, 
</p>
<p>copyright laws often impose certain obligations on publishers and other secondary rights 
</p>
<p>holders, which cannot be waived by contract. The scope and breadth of these &#8220;moral rights&#8221; 
</p>
<p>varies significantly from country to country. The Berne Convention establishes a minimum 
</p>
<p>floor requiring member States to protect certain moral rights of authors, but no particular 
</p>
<p>approach is mandated by the TRIPS Agreement.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Copyright policy and protection of authorship 
</b></p>
<p>26. It is sometimes claimed that intellectual property rights are human rights, or that 
</p>
<p>article 15, paragraph 1 (c), of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights recognizes a human right to protection of intellectual property along the lines set out 
</p>
<p>by the TRIPS Agreement and other intellectual property treaties. The Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed that this equation is false and 
</p>
<p>misleading.9 Some elements of intellectual property protection are indeed required &#8212; or at 
</p>
<p>least strongly encouraged &#8212; by reference to the right to science and culture. Other elements 
</p>
<p>of contemporary intellectual property laws go beyond what the right to protection of 
</p>
<p>authorship requires, and may even be incompatible with the right to science and culture.  
</p>
<p>27. Protection of authorship requires States to respect and protect the moral and material 
</p>
<p>interests resulting from any scientific, artistic or literary production of which a person is the 
</p>
<p>author. The term &#8220;author&#8221; has a particular meaning, borrowed by human rights documents 
</p>
<p>from copyright law. &#8220;Author&#8221; refers to the creator of any work eligible for copyright 
</p>
<p>protection. Thus, writers, painters, photographers, composers, choreographers, storytellers, 
</p>
<p>graphic designers, scholars, bloggers and computer software designers will all be 
</p>
<p>considered as &#8220;authors&#8221; under copyright law. From the human rights perspective, the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;author&#8221; is to be understood as including individuals, groups or communities that have 
</p>
<p>created a work, even where that work may not be protected by copyright. Within both the 
</p>
<p>human rights and the copyright framework, both professional and amateur authors/artists 
</p>
<p>may qualify for recognition as an author.  
</p>
<p>28. The moral and material interests of authors are deeply affected by copyright policy, 
</p>
<p>which in some ways falls short of adequately protecting authorship. In other ways, 
</p>
<p>copyright laws often go too far, unnecessarily limiting cultural freedom and participation. 
</p>
<p>Unlike copyrights, the human right to protection of authorship is non-transferable, 
</p>
<p>grounded on the concept of human dignity, and may be claimed only by the human creator, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;whether man or woman, individual or group of individuals&#8221;.10 Even when an author sells 
</p>
<p>their copyright interest to a corporate publisher or distributer, the right to protection of 
</p>
<p>authorship remains with the human author(s) whose creative vision gave expression to the 
</p>
<p>work.  
</p>
<p>29. The human right to protection of authorship is thus not simply a synonym for, or 
</p>
<p>reference to, copyright protection, but a related concept against which copyright law should 
</p>
<p>be judged. Protection of authorship as a human right requires in some ways more and in 
</p>
<p>other ways less than what is currently found in the copyright laws of most countries.

<p><b> A. </b>The roots of &#8220;moral and material interests&#8221; of authors in copyright law<b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. During the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the language referring to 
</p>
<p>the protection of the moral and material interests of authors was included only after 
</p>
<p>considerable debate.11<b> </b>Partly, the disagreement stemmed from two divergent traditions of 
</p>
<p>philosophical justification for copyright protection. 
</p>
<p>31. The &#8220;moral rights&#8221; tradition emphasizes the nature of creative work as an expression 
</p>
<p>of its author&#8217;s personality and as a product of uniquely personal labour. According to that 
</p>
<p>view, the exclusive right of authors to control the use of their creative works extends from 
</p>
<p>the duty to respect the author. The moral rights philosophy is strongly associated with 
</p>
<p>German law and the French tradition of droit d&#8217;auteur that greatly influenced continental 
</p>
<p>Europe, Latin America and former French colonies.  
</p>
<p>32. In contrast, the &#8220;utilitarian&#8221; view approaches copyright protection as a form of 
</p>
<p>commercial regulation, aimed at encouraging greater production and dissemination of 
</p>
<p>creative works. The utilitarian view is strongly associated with the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland and its former colonies.  
</p>
<p>33. In practice, copyright protection in all countries reflects a mixture of both 
</p>
<p>approaches. The moral rights philosophy, however, is essential to understanding the status 
</p>
<p>acquired by moral and material interests of creators in human rights law.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Protecting and promoting the moral interests of authors 
</b></p>
<p>34. While the author&#8217;s material or property interest in their work is of limited duration 
</p>
<p>and may be alienated by contract, a common thread among moral rights provisions is that 
</p>
<p>those rights may not be waived by contract because of the unique link between an author 
</p>
<p>and their work, and/or of the mark of the author&#8217;s personality in that work. Moral rights are 
</p>
<p>often invoked to protect authors from abuses by publishers, distributors or collectors. 
</p>
<p>35. The Berne Convention specifies that States should protect the inalienable right of 
</p>
<p>authors to claim authorship of the work (the right to attribution) and to object to any 
</p>
<p>distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the 
</p>
<p>said work, which would be prejudicial to the author&#8217;s honour or reputation (the right to 
</p>
<p>integrity) (art. 6 bis). The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
</p>
<p>interpreted those rights of attribution and integrity to form part of the moral interests 
</p>
<p>referred to in human rights law.12 In some countries, copyright laws recognize additional 
</p>
<p>moral rights beyond those two basic ones. 
</p>
<p>36. The moral right to object to distortions or modifications of a work must be 
</p>
<p>interpreted in balance with the right of others to reinterpret cultural inheritance and exercise 
</p>
<p>their own creativity. The destruction of an artistic work most clearly illustrates a violation 
</p>
<p>of the creator&#8217;s right of integrity. Moral rights may also require the preservation of certain 
</p>
<p>works, as the sale of a painting or statue does not extinguish the artist&#8217;s moral rights. In 
</p>
<p>contrast, a parody of a work should typically not be understood as a derogatory action. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, many countries specifically allow for parody even without the permission of the 
</p>
<p>original author, recognizing the expressive and creative value of this form of artistic 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 See Peter Yu, &#8220;Reconceptualizing Intellectual Property Interests in a Human Rights Framework&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i>U.C. Davis Law Review</i>, No. 40 (2007), p. 1051&#8211;1058; Johannes Morsink, <i>The Universal Declaration 
</i></p>
<p><i>of Human Rights: Origins, Drafting, and Intent</i> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 222.

<p>reinterpretation. Hence, the moral interests of authors in objecting to modifications of their 
</p>
<p>works are interpreted in conjunction with the moral interest of other authors&#8217; creative 
</p>
<p>licence. 
</p>
<p>37. One recent attempt to strike that balance is the opinion of the Court of Justice of the 
</p>
<p>European Union in case C-201/13, <i>Deckmyn </i>v. <i>Vandersteen</i>. The Court stated that the 
</p>
<p>fundamental right to freedom of expression requires European countries to permit the 
</p>
<p>unauthorized use of copyrighted works for the purposes of parody (which evokes an 
</p>
<p>existing work while being noticeably different and constitutes an expression of humour or 
</p>
<p>mockery). The Court recognized, however, that a particular act of parody might 
</p>
<p>unreasonably abuse the legitimate interests of the author and copyright owner, and that, if a 
</p>
<p>parody &#8220;conveys a discriminatory message which has the effect of associating the protected 
</p>
<p>work with such a message&#8221;, authors &#8220;have, in principle, a legitimate interest in ensuring 
</p>
<p>that the work protected by copyright is not associated with such a message&#8221;.13 The Court 
</p>
<p>advised national courts to determine that considering all the circumstances of a particular 
</p>
<p>case. 
</p>
<p>38. Copyright regimes may under-protect the moral interests of authors because 
</p>
<p>producers/publishers/distributors and other &#8220;subsequent right-holders&#8221; typically exercise 
</p>
<p>more influence over law-making than individual creators, and may have opposing interests 
</p>
<p>when it comes to those rights. That makes it important to look beyond moral rights already 
</p>
<p>recognized in copyright regimes to discern additional or stronger moral interests from a 
</p>
<p>human rights standpoint, such as, in particular, the interest of artists and researchers in 
</p>
<p>creative, artistic and academic freedom, freedom of expression, and personal autonomy. 
</p>
<p>39. The moral interests of authors in artistic freedom and autonomy offer useful guiding 
</p>
<p>principles for setting rules regarding what may and may not be done with copyrighted 
</p>
<p>works. Many countries already recognize that artistic freedom and autonomy require 
</p>
<p>copyright rules to make room for parody, commentary, and other creative transformations 
</p>
<p>of existing works. Artistic freedom and autonomy might also require protecting authors 
</p>
<p>from charges of copyright infringement for adapting or distributing their own works, even 
</p>
<p>where they have transferred their copyright to a publisher. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Protecting and promoting the material interests of authors 
</b></p>
<p>40. The human right to protection of authorship requires that copyright policy be 
</p>
<p>carefully designed to ensure that authors benefit materially. An important distinction must 
</p>
<p>be drawn here between human authors and corporate rights holders.  
</p>
<p>41. Authors often sell part or all of the copyright interests in their works to a corporation 
</p>
<p>that commercializes the work. Corporate rights holders play an essential role in the cultural 
</p>
<p>economy. They innovate ways of delivering cultural works to consumers, provide income 
</p>
<p>to artists, offer much-needed capital to finance high-budget cultural productions and can 
</p>
<p>free artists from many of the burdens of commercializing their work. Nonetheless, their 
</p>
<p>economic interests do not enjoy the status of human rights. From the human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective, copyright policy and industry practices must be judged by how well they serve 
</p>
<p>the interests of human authors, as well as the public&#8217;s interest in cultural participation.  
</p>
<p>42. Corporate rights holders with immense financial resources and professional 
</p>
<p>sophistication are typically better positioned to influence copyright policymaking, and may 
</p>
<p>even claim to speak for authors in copyright debates. Unfortunately, the material interests 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 Case C-201/13, <i>Johan Deckmyn and Vrijheidsfonds VZW</i> v. <i>Helena Vandersteen and Others</i>, 
</p>
<p>3 September 2014, paras. 29&#8211;31. </p>


<p>of corporate rights holders do not always coincide with those of authors. The human right 
</p>
<p>to protection of authorship demands particular attention to situations where those interests 
</p>
<p>diverge.  
</p>
<p>43. Most artists seeking to earn a living from artistic expressions must negotiate 
</p>
<p>copyright licences with corporations to commercialize their works. Those contractual 
</p>
<p>exchanges are often marked by an imbalance of power between the parties. Corporations 
</p>
<p>may leverage a stronger bargaining position to retain most of the resulting profit, reducing 
</p>
<p>benefits for artists. Copyright policy can help protect authors from such vulnerability.  
</p>
<p>44. One technique is copyright reversion. In some countries, creators retain the right to 
</p>
<p>reclaim copyright interests they have transferred after a set number of years, providing the 
</p>
<p>creator a second opportunity to negotiate a better return. It is important to note that the 
</p>
<p>reversion right cannot be waived by contract, protecting artists against pressure to surrender 
</p>
<p>it. 
</p>
<p>45. Copyright laws may also establish a creator&#8217;s right to share in the proceeds from 
</p>
<p>future sales of their work, which may not be waived by contract. For example, many 
</p>
<p>countries protect visual artists whose works are resold (<i>droit de suite</i>), ensuring that an 
</p>
<p>artist receives a share of the increased value. Many copyright laws also require that 
</p>
<p>background vocalists and session musicians be compensated at a set percentage of total 
</p>
<p>revenues.  
</p>
<p>46. Mechanisms providing compensation for uses based on exceptions and limitations, 
</p>
<p>sometimes referred to as statutory licensing, offer another approach. Many countries 
</p>
<p>specify certain uses of copyrighted works that, whilst not requiring a negotiated permission 
</p>
<p>from the rights holder, require that compensation be paid at a legally specified rate &#8212; the 
</p>
<p>right to remuneration replaces the right to prohibit. For example, the law might specify that 
</p>
<p>once a musical composition is published, any musician may perform and record it, but must 
</p>
<p>pay a specified fee for each performance/copy. Similarly, some national laws specify that 
</p>
<p>once a book is published, libraries are free to rent out copies of the book but must make a 
</p>
<p>payment each time it is borrowed. Often, these payments are split according to a statutory 
</p>
<p>formula between the creator and the current rights holder, typically a corporation. These 
</p>
<p>royalty splits are not subject to negotiation between the artists and rights holders, and may 
</p>
<p>be more favourable to artists than the splits negotiated in contractual settings.14  
</p>
<p>47. National copyright laws may also require that exclusive licences &#8212; those that limit 
</p>
<p>the author&#8217;s ability to offer the work to other parties &#8212; be put into writing. Courts may also 
</p>
<p>choose to adopt an interpretative principle that any contractual ambiguities should be 
</p>
<p>resolved in favour of the author rather than in favour of the corporate licensee. 
</p>
<p>48. Designing copyright law to promote the material interests of authors requires 
</p>
<p>nuance. &#8220;Stronger&#8221; copyright protection does not necessarily advance the material interests 
</p>
<p>of creators. Exceptions and limitations often support creators&#8217; material interests by offering 
</p>
<p>opportunities for statutory licensing income or the possibility of relying in part on the work 
</p>
<p>of other artists in a new work or performance. An appropriate balance is crucial, 
</p>
<p>recognizing that creators are both supported and constrained by copyright rules. Inequalities 
</p>
<p>of bargaining power must be addressed, taking advantage of opportunities to help 
</p>
<p>strengthen the hand of artists through mechanisms such as copyright reversion, <i>droit de 
</i></p>
<p><i>suite</i> and statutory licensing. 
</p>

</p>
<p>of Exclusivity in Copyright Law&#8221;, <i>Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment &amp; Technology Law</i>, vol. 12, 
</p>
<p>No. 3 (spring 2010), p. 515. </p>


<p>49. Measures beyond copyright law can also advance the right to protection of 
</p>
<p>authorship. Artistic livelihoods may be supported by, for example, minimum wage 
</p>
<p>protections, collective bargaining power, social security guarantees, budgetary support for 
</p>
<p>the arts, artistic education, library purchasing, immigration and visa policies and measures 
</p>
<p>to promote cultural tourism. Copyright laws should be understood as part of a larger set of 
</p>
<p>policies to promote the cultural sector and the right to science and culture. 
</p>
<p>50. In contrast to the perpetual moral interests of authors, the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights has emphasized that the material interests of authors need not 
</p>
<p>necessarily be protected forever, or even for an author&#8217;s entire life (general comment No. 
</p>
<p>17, para. 16). The human right to protection of authorship is fully compatible with an 
</p>
<p>approach to copyright that limits the terms of protection in order to ensure a vibrant public 
</p>
<p>domain of shared cultural heritage, from which all creators are free to draw. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur received a number of contributions, which expressed the 
</p>
<p>concerns of copyright holders about the threat cultural industries face due to digital piracy 
</p>
<p>enabled by evolving digital technologies. Proposals to address that situation as related to 
</p>
<p>the Internet include website blocking, content filtering and other limits on access to content 
</p>
<p>subject to copyright, as well as the liability imposed on intermediaries for infringing 
</p>
<p>content disseminated by users. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, such measures could 
</p>
<p>result in restrictions that are not compatible with the right to freedom of expression and the 
</p>
<p>right to science and culture.15 Additional concern is expressed over the deployment of 
</p>
<p>aggressive means of combating digital piracy, including denial of Internet access, high 
</p>
<p>statutory damages or fines and criminal sanctions for non-commercial infringement. There 
</p>
<p>are also issues of piracy unrelated to the Internet. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, that 
</p>
<p>important topic requires additional study from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Copyright law and the human right to property 
</b></p>
<p>52. An alternative human rights basis for intellectual property protection is recognized 
</p>
<p>through the lens of the right to property in the European regional human rights system, as 
</p>
<p>well as in some national constitutions both within and outside Europe.16 The Charter of 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Rights of the European Union specifically calls for the protection of 
</p>
<p>intellectual property within the general rubric of property (art. 17, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>53. The right to property obliges States to respect the copyright laws that they have 
</p>
<p>adopted.17 It does not, however, mandate any particular approach to copyright policy. States 
</p>
<p>are free to adjust copyright rules through legal processes to promote the interests of authors, 
</p>
<p>the right of everyone to take part in cultural life and other human rights such as the right to 
</p>
<p>education. Within the right to property framework, it is also acceptable to assure authors&#8217; 
</p>
<p>interests through rules granting a right to remuneration rather than a right to exclude, as 
</p>
<p>well as rules granting rights to exclusion or remuneration in some, but not all, 
</p>
<p>circumstances.18  
</p>
<p>54. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in paragraph 15 of its 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 17, for its part, avoided the conflation of the term &#8220;material interests&#8221;

<p>with property rights, especially when held by corporations. It recognized, however, that the 
</p>
<p>protection of authors&#8217; &#8220;material interests&#8221; reflected the close linkage of this provision with 
</p>
<p>the right to own property, as set out in article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and in regional human rights instruments, as well as with the right of any worker to 
</p>
<p>adequate remuneration. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. The rights of indigenous peoples and local communities </b> 
</p>
<p>55. Recognizing the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination and to maintain 
</p>
<p>and develop their culture and their struggle for cultural survival, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples assures indigenous peoples the right to 
</p>
<p>maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over their cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions (art. 31, para. 1). Some 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples consider it vital to keep certain cultural expressions and forms of 
</p>
<p>knowledge from public disclosure, to be used only by persons and in ways appropriate to 
</p>
<p>their customary laws and practices, and never commercially exploited. Some indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples desire to benefit from the commercial potential of licensing products based on their 
</p>
<p>traditional knowledge and cultural expressions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>56. Intellectual property regimes have historically failed to take into account the unique 
</p>
<p>concerns of indigenous peoples. For instance, trade secrecy regimes require that the 
</p>
<p>information be of commercial value; that is useful for protecting commercial secrets but not 
</p>
<p>sacred songs or folklore. Copyright regimes provide time-limited protections, meaning that 
</p>
<p>traditional cultural expressions may be regarded as being in the public domain.  
</p>
<p>57. Moral rights might be adapted to provide protection for the collective holders of 
</p>
<p>traditional cultural expressions. Like individual authors, communities care deeply about the 
</p>
<p>right to attribution and credit, protecting their cultural works from destruction and 
</p>
<p>preventing the exhibition of their cultural expressions in ways that disparage the 
</p>
<p>community. As with individual authors, however, the right to freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>protects the right to criticism and parody, from within as well as from outside the 
</p>
<p>community, taking into consideration all circumstances of a particular case.19 
</p>
<p>58. In 1995, the principles and guidelines for the protection of the heritage of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples made an important contribution to adapting the concept of moral and material 
</p>
<p>interests of authors to the specific context of indigenous cultural property 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1995/26). Of note are the principles that indigenous peoples&#8217; ownership and 
</p>
<p>custody of their heritage must continue to be collective, permanent and inalienable; that the 
</p>
<p>free and informed consent of the traditional owners be a precondition of any agreements for 
</p>
<p>the recording, study, use or display of indigenous peoples&#8217; heritage; and that concerned 
</p>
<p>peoples be the primary beneficiaries of commercial application
 
of their heritage.  
</p>
<p>59. Efforts by States to give effect to indigenous claims over their cultural heritage vary 
</p>
<p>enormously. The WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic 
</p>
<p>Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore is continuing negotiations about a possible 
</p>
<p>international legal instrument, or instruments, for the effective protection of traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources.  
</p>

</p>
<p> 19 See the <i>Deckmyn</i> case mentioned above in para. 37. </p>


<p><b> IV. Copyright policy and cultural participation 
</b></p>
<p>60. The human rights perspective calls for recognition of the social and human values 
</p>
<p>inherent in copyright law and a heightened regard for fundamental rights and the needs of 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups. The emphasis on active participation in cultural and scientific life, 
</p>
<p>rather than simply the ability to access cultural and scientific works, recognizes the dual 
</p>
<p>importance of accessing the knowledge and expressive creations of others and of self-
</p>
<p>expression within the broader cultural context.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Promoting cultural participation through exceptions and limitations 
</b></p>
<p>61. Copyright exceptions and limitations &#8212; defining specific uses that do not require a 
</p>
<p>licence from the copyright holder &#8212; constitute a vital part of the balance that copyright law 
</p>
<p>must strike between the interests of rights-holders in exclusive control and the interests of 
</p>
<p>others in cultural participation. Copyright exceptions and limitations have rarely been the 
</p>
<p>topic of international norm-setting, hence State practice varies significantly.20  
</p>
<p>62. One crucial function of exceptions and limitations is to help assure artistic 
</p>
<p>livelihoods. Statutory licensing can facilitate creative transactions and enhance creators&#8217; 
</p>
<p>earnings.21  
</p>
<p>63. Another vital function is to empower new creativity. Copyright exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations can enable caricature, parody, pastiche and appropriation art to borrow 
</p>
<p>recognizably from prior works in order to express something new and different. 
</p>
<p>Documentary film-makers also require freedom to use specific images, video clips or music 
</p>
<p>necessary to tell a particular story. Depending on a country&#8217;s exceptions and limitations 
</p>
<p>regime, those artistic practices may be clearly defined as permissible or may occupy a legal 
</p>
<p>grey zone that makes it difficult for creators to commercialize and distribute their works. 
</p>
<p>64. Copyright exceptions and limitations can also expand educational opportunities by 
</p>
<p>promoting broader access to learning materials. For example, the copyright regimes of 
</p>
<p>China, Thailand and Viet Nam include exceptions and limitations that explicitly authorize 
</p>
<p>many forms of educational copying. In other countries, exceptions and limitations 
</p>
<p>determine whether textbooks may be commercially rented and whether researchers and 
</p>
<p>students can make a personal copy of borrowed materials. Copyright exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations allowing for digitization and display can facilitate distance-learning techniques, 
</p>
<p>bringing new opportunities to students in developing countries or rural regions.  
</p>
<p>65. Furthermore, copyright exceptions and limitations may also expand space for non-
</p>
<p>commercial culture. When the public performance right is defined broadly, exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations can be enacted to exempt religious services, school performances, public 
</p>
<p>festivals and other not-for-profit contexts from securing licences to perform musical or 
</p>
<p>dramatic works. 
</p>
<p>66. A human rights perspective also requires that the potential of copyright exceptions 
</p>
<p>and limitations to promote inclusion and access to cultural works, especially for 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups, be fully explored.  
</p>

<p>67. Disability advocates have long expressed concern that copyright law can impede the 
</p>
<p>adaptation of works into formats functional for people with disabilities when copyright 
</p>
<p>holders fail to publish works in accessible formats, such as Braille, or allow others to do so. 
</p>
<p>To resolve that problem, many countries have adopted copyright exceptions and limitations 
</p>
<p>allowing authorized not-for-profit organizations to produce and distribute accessible works 
</p>
<p>to persons with disabilities. In June 2013, WIPO member States adopted the Marrakesh 
</p>
<p>Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually 
</p>
<p>Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. Under that treaty, which references the right to 
</p>
<p>science and culture among its motivating principles, States commit to enacting exceptions 
</p>
<p>and limitations to facilitate access to published works by persons with disabilities and to 
</p>
<p>allow cross-border transfers of those works.  
</p>
<p>68. Problems of translation and linguistic barriers likewise are of concern for speakers 
</p>
<p>of non-dominant languages. Copyright regimes are formally neutral regarding the language 
</p>
<p>of a work. In practice, however, the results are widely disparate, as copyright protection 
</p>
<p>offers little financial incentive to write and publish in most of the world&#8217;s languages.22 
</p>
<p>People able to speak English, French or Spanish can select reading material from millions 
</p>
<p>of books; however, those unable to speak a globally used language may enjoy access to 
</p>
<p>very few. The vastly unequal distribution of published literary works across languages 
</p>
<p>poses a significant barrier to the right to take part in cultural life for linguistic communities 
</p>
<p>not offering a major publishing market. The issue is not limited to reading for pleasure; that 
</p>
<p>also impacts the ability to pursue education and knowledge, take part in debates on social 
</p>
<p>and political issues and earn a livelihood as a writer.  
</p>
<p>69. Previously, international copyright law offered greater encouragement to the 
</p>
<p>flourishing of literature across many languages because it left the issue of translation rights 
</p>
<p>to be decided by each country. Many countries treated translations as an original expression 
</p>
<p>not requiring a licence from the author of the original work. That changed about a century 
</p>
<p>ago, when revisions to the Berne Convention required that all countries accord copyright 
</p>
<p>holders an exclusive right of translation. That global change overlooked the interests of 
</p>
<p>linguistic groups for whom the ability to translate works into their vernacular languages 
</p>
<p>was essential to promote education and cultural development.23  
</p>
<p>70. During the era of decolonization, in deference to the concerns of newly independent 
</p>
<p>African countries eager to promote their own cultural and scientific development,24 the 
</p>
<p>Berne Community negotiated the Stockholm Protocol Regarding Developing Countries, 
</p>
<p>now incorporated into the Berne Appendix with Special Provisions for Developing 
</p>

<p>Significant reforms would be required for the Berne Appendix to serve its intended purpose 
</p>
<p>of ensuring access to copyrighted materials in all languages, at affordable prices.27 
</p>
<p>71. Depending on the country and specific context, exceptions and limitations may carry 
</p>
<p>an obligation to make payments to authors and/or rights holders or may allow use without 
</p>
<p>compensation. Recognizing that diversity of practice, the Berne Convention requires 
</p>
<p>compensation in the context of statutory licensing arrangements for broadcasting and music 
</p>
<p>recordings, but expressly permits uncompensated exceptions and limitations in other areas, 
</p>
<p>such as quotation or parody.  
</p>
<p>72. Each approach has merits. While the right to protection of authorship might be 
</p>
<p>interpreted to require fair remuneration in every case, there are many contexts in which 
</p>
<p>unpaid uses are important to preserve and most appropriate, especially in developing 
</p>
<p>countries.28 Examples include exceptions for non-commercial libraries, school theatre 
</p>
<p>performances at which no admission is charged, non-commercial artistic endeavours and 
</p>
<p>initiatives making works accessible to people with limited capacity to pay. There are also 
</p>
<p>situations in which operating the necessary administrative apparatus to ensure compliance 
</p>
<p>of required payments in all cases may be more trouble than it is worth, especially should the 
</p>
<p>payment due to the author be very small, and/or where exceptions be rarely used.<b> </b>A lack of 
</p>
<p>compensation does not by itself render an exception or limitation inconsistent with the right 
</p>
<p>to protection of authorship, providing that exceptions and limitations are thoughtfully 
</p>
<p>designed to balance human rights interests in cultural participation with protection of 
</p>
<p>authorship. 
</p>
<p>73. A few countries have a more expansive and flexible exception or limitation, 
</p>
<p>commonly referred to as &#8220;fair use&#8221;. Such provisions authorize courts to adapt copyright law 
</p>
<p>to permit additional unlicensed uses that comply with general standards of fairness to 
</p>
<p>creators and copyright holders. For example, the fair use doctrine in the United States 
</p>
<p>encompasses protection for parody and certain educational uses. It has also been interpreted 
</p>
<p>to permit a search engine to return thumbnail-sized images as part of its search results and 
</p>
<p>to protect technology manufacturers from liability where consumers record a television 
</p>
<p>show to watch later. Most States do not have such broad and flexible exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations; instead each specific type of allowable use is listed in the statute. While 
</p>
<p>enumerated provisions may provide greater clarity regarding permitted uses, they may also 
</p>
<p>fail to be sufficiently comprehensive and adaptable to new contexts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International cooperation on exceptions and limitations 
</b></p>
<p>74. International copyright treaties generally treat copyright protections as mandatory, 
</p>
<p>while treating exceptions and limitations as optional, with very few exceptions. For 
</p>
<p>example, article 10 of the Berne Convention and most national laws specify that it shall not 
</p>
<p>be considered infringement to make a reasonable quotation from a previously published 
</p>
<p>work, for example in the context of research reports, newspaper reporting or literary 
</p>
<p>criticism. Additionally, the recent WIPO Marrakesh Treaty requires signatory States to 
</p>
<p>enact copyright exceptions and limitations in favour of visually impaired readers. 
</p>
<p>75. The standard for judging whether a particular exception or limitation is permissible 
</p>
<p>under international copyright law is not articulated with precision. The Berne Convention 
</p>
<p>preserves national discretion to legally permit even outright copying in certain special cases 
</p>
<p>that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 28 Ibid., p. 19.  </p>


<p>prejudice the legitimate interests of the author (art. 9, para. 2). The TRIPS Agreement uses 
</p>
<p>similar language, but replaces the &#8220;interests of the author&#8221; with the &#8220;interests of the rights 
</p>
<p>holder&#8221; (art. 13). Commonly referred to as the &#8220;three-step test,&#8221; those two provisions are 
</p>
<p>widely understood to set boundaries on States&#8217; ability to enact copyright exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations.29 Yet, considerable disagreement and uncertainty remains about how to 
interpret and apply the standard, leaving many countries hesitant to innovate.30  
</p>
<p>76. Given the importance of copyright exceptions and limitations for the right to science 
</p>
<p>and culture, several avenues of international cooperation merit further exploration. Some 
</p>
<p>analysts propose that international copyright law should recognize a core list of minimum 
</p>
<p>required exceptions and limitations, incorporating those currently recognized by most 
</p>
<p>States, such as quotations and citations, personal use, reproduction by libraries and archives 
</p>
<p>for storage and replacement, copying and adaptation of computer code for interoperability, 
</p>
<p>parody and others.31 Others suggest that a flexible fair-use provision be internationally 
</p>
<p>adopted, explicitly giving countries permission and guidelines to develop additional 
</p>
<p>exceptions and limitations as yet unforeseen.32 Many developing countries would like 
</p>
<p>WIPO to build on its initiative for the Marrakesh Treaty, by considering a treaty on 
</p>
<p>exceptions and limitations to copyright for libraries and archives and/or exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations for education. Strongly supported by library advocacy organizations, that 
</p>
<p>suggestion has met with resistance from developed countries.33 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promoting cultural participation through open licensing 
</b></p>
<p>77. In addition to copyright exceptions and limitations, open licensing has emerged as 
</p>
<p>another essential copyright tool for expanding cultural participation. Open licences do not 
</p>
<p>replace copyright, but are based upon it. In that contractual practice, authors or other rights 
</p>
<p>holders agree to waive many of the exclusive rights they hold under copyright law, enabling 
</p>
<p>others to use the work more freely. Contracts replace an &#8220;all rights reserved&#8221; by a &#8220;some 
</p>
<p>rights reserved&#8221; approach, employing standardized licenses where no compensation is 
</p>
<p>sought by the copyright owner. The result is an agile, low-overhead copyright-management 
</p>
<p>regime, benefiting both copyright owners and licensees.  
</p>
<p>78. The most widely used open licences are the Creative Commons licences. It is 
</p>
<p>estimated that, by 2015, those licenses will have been attached to more than 1 billion </p>
<p>creative works, including photos, websites, music, government databases, UNESCO 
</p>
<p>publications, journal articles and educational textbooks.34 Creative Commons is working to 
</p>
<p>make its open licences interoperable with open licences offered by other organizations, 
</p>
<p>such as the Free Art License and the GNU General Public License widely used for open-
</p>
<p>source software. The idea behind those efforts is to create a &#8220;cultural commons,&#8221; in which 
</p>
<p>everyone can access, share and recombine cultural works.

<p>79. Open licensing can have a particularly profound impact on the dissemination of 
</p>
<p>scholarly knowledge. Science is a process of discovery, collecting and synthesizing 
</p>
<p>evidence and evolving models of the world. That process relies on being able to access, 
</p>
<p>evaluate and criticize the primary evidence, usually recorded in scientific publications, 
</p>
<p>which, like any other original text, are eligible for copyright protection. For-profit academic 
</p>
<p>journals and publishers often prohibit author-researchers from making their own material 
</p>
<p>accessible over the Internet, in order to maximize subscription fees. The prevailing 
</p>
<p>restricted-access dissemination model limits the ability to share published scientific 
</p>
<p>knowledge, inhibiting the emergence of a truly global and collaborative scientific 
</p>
<p>community. 
</p>
<p>80. Libraries negotiating subscription fees with publishers face an unequal bargaining 
</p>
<p>situation; they are obliged to pay high prices, or forego providing researchers and students 
</p>
<p>with the resources needed for their work. The burden of journal subscription fees is 
</p>
<p>becoming unsustainable even at some of the world&#8217;s best-resourced universities.35 In some 
</p>
<p>developing countries, the subscription fee to a single database may exceed the total annual 
</p>
<p>budget of a university library. Students, citizens and professional scientists at less wealthy 
</p>
<p>institutions are denied access to the frontiers of scientific progress. 
</p>
<p>81. Scientific authors have a moral interest in being able to participate in and contribute 
</p>
<p>to the global scientific enterprise, and to be acknowledged for their contribution as widely 
</p>
<p>as possible. Exclusive subscription models for scientific dissemination thus hinder rather 
</p>
<p>than advance those moral interests. As authors are rarely paid for their contributions, 
</p>
<p>exclusive access to those works promotes the material interests of publishers, but not those 
</p>
<p>of authors.  
</p>
<p>82. Open access publishing is emerging as a significant alternative model for 
</p>
<p>disseminating scientific knowledge.36 Relying on Creative Commons licences and digital 
</p>
<p>distribution to make academic articles available to anyone over the Internet, it has already 
</p>
<p>become an important part of mainstream academic journal publishing. To fund open access 
</p>
<p>journals, some initiatives have established a publication fee that is paid by the author or the 
</p>
<p>author&#8217;s employer or funder. In some countries, institutions have pledged grants to cover 
</p>
<p>such author charges. In some cases, to encourage wider participation by researchers from 
</p>
<p>low-and middle-income countries, reductions or waivers in publication fees have been 
</p>
<p>instituted.37  
</p>
<p>83. Increasingly, academic institutions, research foundations and governments are 
</p>
<p>accelerating the transition by making open access publication the default approach to 
</p>
<p>scientific and government publications. Recently, some government funders have started 
</p>
<p>requiring publicly funded research to be made publicly accessible; many countries are 
</p>
<p>considering similar steps.38  
</p>
<p>84. A newer initiative for open educational resources makes openly licensed educational 
</p>
<p>materials available online, free for students and teachers to copy, adapt or translate. Open 
</p>
<p>educational resources are increasingly recognized as holding great potential to expand the

<p>availability, affordability and quality of textbooks, because they can be reproduced cheaply, 
</p>
<p>quickly transmitted to distant locations, updated regularly and adapted to new cultural and 
</p>
<p>linguistic contexts.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Examples of good practices 
</b></p>
<p>85. Different approaches can bring intellectual property regimes into alignment with the 
</p>
<p>right to science and culture: reforming copyright laws to better protect the right to science 
</p>
<p>and culture or supporting novel approaches that encourage innovation and creativity for 
</p>
<p>broader access. Both approaches may be used simultaneously.  
</p>
<p>86. Several countries have embarked upon a highly participatory process for reforming 
</p>
<p>their copyright law. Brazil, for example, launched a national forum on copyright law, 
</p>
<p>deploying a series of conferences and public audiences to diagnose problems in 2007, as 
</p>
<p>well as using the Internet to elicit feedback on the draft bill. Thousands of comments and 
</p>
<p>contributions were made. In 2014, the copyright law of the United Kingdom was adopted 
</p>
<p>following an extensive consultative process, including public discussions on draft bills.39 
</p>
<p>The resulting legislation expands copyright exceptions and limitations and ensures that 
</p>
<p>several crucial exceptions and limitations can no longer be overridden by private contract or 
</p>
<p>unilateral terms and conditions. Those efforts offer a blueprint for maximizing public 
</p>
<p>participation in legislative efforts to align intellectual property regimes with human rights 
</p>
<p>and other public interests. 
</p>
<p>87. Many countries are encouraging the transition to open access scholarly publishing. 
</p>
<p>For example, in Mexico, Government agencies and universities have collaborated to 
</p>
<p>introduce the National Consortium of Scientific and Technological Information Resources 
</p>
<p>to improve open access to Mexican peer-reviewed journals. The Universidad Aut&#243;noma del 
</p>
<p>Estado de M&#233;xico already provides free and open access to more than 640 journals, 
</p>
<p>including 169 from Mexico. Universities are also placing thesis papers, conference papers 
</p>
<p>and other multimedia in institutional repositories.40 
</p>
<p>88. In South Africa, open educational resources produced by social publishers help 
</p>
<p>address problems of high-cost textbooks. For example, Siyavula science textbooks for 
</p>
<p>grades 4&#8211;12, authored by teams of South African scientists, are licensed for public use 
</p>
<p>through Creative Commons and distributed via the Internet. Teachers prefer those books for 
</p>
<p>their higher-quality content and simple English appropriate for non-native speakers.41 
</p>
<p>Siyavula estimates that more than 12 million copies of its books are used in South Africa.42

<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The human rights perspective focuses attention on important themes that may 
</b></p>
<p><b>be lost when copyright is treated primarily in terms of trade: the social function and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human dimension of intellectual property, the public interests at stake, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of transparency and public participation in policymaking, the need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>design copyright rules to genuinely benefit human authors, the importance of broad 
</b></p>
<p><b>diffusion and cultural freedom, the importance of not-for-profit cultural production 
</b></p>
<p><b>and innovation, and the special consideration for the impact of copyright law upon 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalised or vulnerable groups.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur draws the following conclusions and makes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Ensuring transparency and public participation in law-making 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>International intellectual property instruments, including trade agreements, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be negotiated in a transparent way, permitting public engagement and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commentary.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>National copyright laws and policies should be adopted, reviewed and revised 
</b></p>
<p><b>in forums that promote broad engagement, with input from creators and the public at 
</b></p>
<p><b>large. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Ensuring the compatibility of copyright laws with human rights 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>International copyright instruments should be subject to human rights impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessments and contain safeguards for freedom of expression, the right to science and 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture, and other human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Such instruments should never impede the ability of States to adopt exceptions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and limitations that reconcile copyright protection with the right to science and 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture or other human rights, based on domestic circumstances. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>States should complete a human rights impact assessment of their domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>copyright law and policy, utilizing the right to science and culture as a guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle.

</p>
<p>Commons), 16 November 2010. Available from http://creativecommons.org/tag/pratham-books. </p>


<p>97. <b>National courts and administrative bodies should interpret national copyright 
</b></p>
<p><b>rules consistently with human rights standards, including the right to science and 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Copyright laws should place no limitations upon the right to science and 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture, unless the State can demonstrate that the limitation pursues a legitimate aim, 
</b></p>
<p><b>is compatible with the nature of this right and is strictly necessary for the promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of general welfare in a democratic society (art. 4 of the International Covenant on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). Standards applicable to restrictions on 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of expression must also be duly taken into consideration. In all cases, the least 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrictive measure shall be adopted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Protection of the moral and material interests of authors 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The right to protection of authorship is the right of the human author(s) whose 
</b></p>
<p><b>creative vision gave expression to the work. Corporate right holders must not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>presumed to speak for the interests of authors. Both professional and amateur 
</b></p>
<p><b>creators must be empowered to have a voice and influence over copyright regime 
</b></p>
<p><b>design. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Merely enacting copyright protection is insufficient to satisfy the human right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to protection of authorship. States bear a human rights obligation to ensure that 
</b></p>
<p>copyright regulations are designed to promote creators&#8217; ability to earn a livelihood 
</p>
<p><b>and to protect their scientific and creative freedom, the integrity of their work and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their right to attribution.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Given the inequality of legal expertise and bargaining power between artists 
</b></p>
<p><b>and their publishers and distributors, States should protect artists from exploitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the context of copyright licensing and royalty collection. In many contexts, it will be 
</b></p>
<p><b>most appropriate to do so through legal protections that may not be waived by 
</b></p>
<p><b>contract. Enforceable rights of attribution and integrity, <i>droit de suite</i>, statutory 
</b></p>
<p><b>licensing and reversion rights are recommended examples.  </b></p>
<p>102. <b>States should further develop and promote mechanisms for protecting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>moral and material interests of creators without unnecessarily limiting public access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to creative works, through exceptions and limitations and subsidy of openly licensed 
</b></p>
<p><b>works.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Copyright law is but one element of protection of authorship. States are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to consider policies on labour practices, social benefits, funding for 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and the arts, and cultural tourism from the perspective of that right.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>Copyright limitations and exceptions and the &#8220;three<b>-</b>step test&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>States have a positive obligation to provide for a robust and flexible system of 
</b></p>
<p><b>copyright exceptions and limitations to honour their human rights obligations. The 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;three<b>-</b>step test&#8221; of international copyright law should be interpreted to encourage the 
</p>
<p><b>establishment of such a system of exceptions and limitations. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>States should consider that exceptions and limitations that promote creative 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom and cultural participation are consistent with the right to protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorship. Protection of authorship does not imply perfect authorial control over 
</b></p>
<p><b>creative works.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>States should enable allowance for uncompensated use of copyrighted works, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular in contexts of income disparity, non-profit efforts, or undercapitalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>artists, where a requirement of compensation might stifle efforts to create new works 
</b></p>
<p><b>or reach new audiences.  </b></p>


<p>107. <b>States should ensure that exceptions and limitations cannot be waived by 
</b></p>
<p><b>contract, or unduly impaired by technical measures of protection or online contracts 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the digital environment. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>At the domestic level, judicial or administrative procedures should enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the public to request the implementation and expansion of exceptions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>limitations to assure their constitutional and human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>WIPO members should support the adoption of international instruments on 
</b></p>
<p><b>copyright exceptions and limitations for libraries and education. The possibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing a core list of minimum required exceptions and limitations incorporating 
</b></p>
<p><b>those currently recognized by most States, and/or an international fair use provision, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also be explored.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>WTO should preserve the exemption of least developed countries from 
</b></p>
<p><b>complying with provisions of the TRIPS Agreement until they reach a stage of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development where they no longer qualify as least developed countries. </b></p>
<p><b>  Adopting policies fostering access to science and culture  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Open access scholarships, open educational resources and public art and 
</b></p>
<p><b>artistic expressions are examples of approaches that treat cultural production as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>public endeavour for the benefit of all. Those approaches complement the private, for-
</b></p>
<p><b>profit models of production and distribution and have a particularly important role.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The products of creative efforts subsidized by governments, intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations or charitable entities, should be made widely accessible. States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>redirect financial support from proprietary publishing models to open publishing 
</b></p>
<p><b>models. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Public and private universities and public research agencies should adopt 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies to promote open access to published research, materials and data on an open 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equitable basis, especially through the adoption of Creative Commons licences. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Indigenous peoples, minorities and marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Creativity is not a privilege of an elite segment of society or professional artists, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but a universal right. Copyright law and policy must be designed with sensitivity to 
</b></p>
<p><b>populations that have special needs or may be overlooked by the marketplace. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>States should institute measures to ensure that all people enjoy the moral and 
</b></p>
<p><b>material interests of their creative expressions and to prevent limitations, such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>geography, language, poverty, illiteracy, or disability, from blocking full and equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to, participation in and contribution to cultural and scientific life.  
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>States should ratify the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published 
</b></p>
<p><b>Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ensure that their copyright laws contain adequate exceptions to facilitate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>availability of works in formats accessible to persons with visual impairments and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other disabilities, such as deafness.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>States should adopt measures to ensure the right of indigenous peoples to 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over their cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Further studies should be undertaken to examine what reforms are needed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>better enable access to copyrighted materials in all languages, at affordable prices. </b></p>


<p><b>  The right to science and culture and copyright in the digital environment 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>All stakeholders should devote more focused discussion on how best to protect 
</b></p>
<p><b>the moral and material interests of authors in the digital environment, taking care to 
</b></p>
<p><b>avoid a potentially disproportionate impact on the rights to freedom of expression and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural participation.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Alternatives to criminal sanctions and blocking of contents and websites for 
</b></p>
<p><b>copyright infringement should be envisaged.  </b></p>
