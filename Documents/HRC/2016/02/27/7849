</b></p>
<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health undertook a visit to Japan, at the invitation 
of the Government, from 15 to 26 November 2012. The purpose of the mission was to 
ascertain, in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, the measures taken by the Government of 
Japan for the successful realization of the right to health.  
</p>
<p>2. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur considered issues relating to the 
realization of the right to health in the wake of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Dai-
ichi nuclear power plant on 11 March 2011, the events leading up to it and emergency 
response, recovery and mitigation. The Special Rapporteur visited Tokyo and Sendai, as 
well as numerous communities and cities in Fukushima prefecture.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with senior government officials from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and Welfare, 
the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the Ministry of the 
Environment, as well as with senior officials from the Reconstruction Agency and Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority. He met with the representatives of United Nations agencies, health 
professionals, academics, representatives of civil society organizations and community 
members. He also met with senior Government officials in Fukushima and Miyagi 
Prefectures. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Japan for its invitation 
and full cooperation during his visit. He also thanks all those who met with him, gave their 
time and extended cooperation to him during the mission.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>4. Japan has ratified a number of international human rights treaties recognizing the 
right to health, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the first two Optional Protocols 
thereto, and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. Japan signed but has not yet ratified the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. Even though the Constitution of Japan of 1946 does not explicitly 
guarantee the right to health, article 25 thereto requires the State to promote public health.  
</p>
<p>5. The Act on Regulation of Nuclear Source Materials, Nuclear Fuel Materials and 
Reactors, the Act on Basic Act on Disaster Control Measures and the Act on Special 
Measures concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness provide the basic legal framework 
for nuclear disaster countermeasures and the emergency response of Japan after the nuclear 
accident.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident 
</b></p>
<p>6. The nuclear accident occurred soon after the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan on 11 
March 2011. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 9.0, occurred off the east coast of Japan 
in the Pacific Ocean. It gave rise to a tsunami with waves of up to 40 metres high. The 
</p>
<p><b>4</b>  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>earthquake and tsunami resulted in 15,879 deaths and 6,126 injured people.1 Nuclear power 
reactors at Tokai Daini, Higashi-Dori, Onagawa and the Fukushima Daini plant were also 
affected, although no major damage was caused to any of them.2  
</p>
<p>7. At the time of the earthquake, the operation of reactors 4, 5 and 6 six of the 
Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, owned by the Tokyo Electric Power Company 
(TEPCO), had been suspended for a routine inspection. Though units 1, 2 and 3 went into 
automatic shut-down mode as soon as the earthquake struck, the electricity supply to the 
power plant was lost. Tsunami waves as high as 14 metres hit the plant approximately 50 
minutes after the earthquake, overwhelming its walls. Designed to withstand waves of a 
maximum height of 5.7 metres, the walls failed to contain the impact of the tsunami, 
causing a complete power blackout in units 1 to 5. Communication systems within and 
outside the plant site were also compromised.3 Owing to complete power outage, units 1 to 
3 at the Dai-ichi plant lost the ability to maintain proper reactor cooling and suffered a 
meltdown; consequently, the fuel contained in the reactors was exposed and damaged, and 
a series of explosions occurred. Unit 4 suffered a hydrogen explosion on 15 March 2011.4 
Since the nuclear accident, reactors 1 to 4 have been decommissioned.5
</p>
<p>8. The amount of radioactive caesium (137C) released by the accident at the Dai-ichi 
Plant is estimated to be 168 times higher than that released by the atomic bomb in 
Hiroshima.6 According to TEPCO, the accident released 900 petabecquerels of radioactive 
iodine and caesium (iodine conversion).7 Other radioactive materials released in the wake 
of the accident included radioactive Tellurium (129mTe, 129Te), Silver (110mAg), Lanthanum 
(140La) and Barium (140Ba).8
</p>
<p>9.  Owing to the similarities between the accidents in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island 
and Fukushima,9 it is understandable that lessons from the first two were drawn when

<p>devising strategies for Fukushima. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to the fact, 
however, that crucial and complete information regarding the Chernobyl accident was not 
made public until 1990;10 studies on Chernobyl may therefore not take fully into account 
the effects of contamination and radiation exposure.11 In that context, it is of concern that 
only the increased prevalence of thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl accident is 
acknowledged and applied to the accident in Fukushima. Reports on the impact on health of 
radiation exposure after the Chernobyl accident have characterized evidence of other health 
anomalies as &#8220;inconclusive&#8221;.12 This regrettably neglects other effects on health of radiation 
exposure, such as chromosomal aberrations,13 increased childhood and adult morbidity, 
impairment14 and leukaemia,15 which may require monitoring.16  
</p>
<p>10. The Government has relied on recommendations from the International Commission 
on Radiological Protection, which provide a reference level for radiation dose of 1 
mSv/year to 20 mSv/year for resettling people in contaminated areas.17 Life span 
epidemiological studies of survivors of the bombing of Hiroshima and of Nagasaki point, 
however, to causal links between long-term exposure to low doses of radiation and the 
increased incidence of cancer.18 The Special Rapporteur considers that disregarding these 
findings will diminish the understanding of and increase vulnerability to the health effects 
of long-term exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. The right to health and nuclear disaster management 
</b></p>
<p>11. The nuclear accident in Japan has affected the right to health of evacuees and 
residents alike, and has had an impact on physical and mental health, particularly of 
pregnant women, older persons and children. The precise health implications of radiation 
exposure are still not clear, given that the long-term health effects of low-dose ionizing 
radiation are still being studied. The evacuation has caused the breakdown of families and 
communities, giving rise to mental health concerns, especially among first responders, 
older persons, mothers and children.  
</p>
<p>12. The enjoyment of the right to health is dependent on underlying determinants, such 
as safe and nutritious food, and access to safe and potable water, a healthy environment and 
housing.19 The accident caused widespread contamination of soil, water, food and the 
environment. Authorities in Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Chiba and Tochigi therefore 
imposed restrictions on the consumption of tap water when radioactive iodine and caesium 
higher than the permissible limit were detected in it.20  
</p>
<p>13. The right to health requires the State to ensure availability and accessibility of 
quality health facilities, goods and services.21 This includes information that allows 
individuals to make informed decisions regarding their health. Furthermore, monitoring the 
health of people for adverse effects of radiation and providing timely health care are an 
important aspect of the fulfilment of the right to health. The State is also required to have in 
place evidence-based policies for the decontamination of affected areas to restore the life 
and health of people as soon as possible. Lastly, transparency and accountability in 
governance,22 access to remedies23 and participation of the affected population24 in 
decision-making processes are necessary to the enjoyment of the right to health.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Nuclear emergency response 
</b></p>
<p>14. Soon after the earthquake and the tsunami hit the Dai-ichi plant, the Government of 
Japan announced a &#8220;nuclear emergency situation&#8221; pursuant to article 15 of the Act on 
Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness.25 This was the first step in 
initiating the emergency response system26 aimed at containing the accident and protecting

</b></p>
<p>individuals from adverse health effects arising from radiological and non-radiological 
causes.27
</p>
<p><b> 1. Information on the nuclear accident and evacuation 
</b>15. Access to information is an essential component of the right to health, as it allows 
individuals to make informed decisions about their health. Information about the nuclear 
accident, including on contaminated and potentially contaminated areas, should be made 
public immediately and in a coordinated manner. In addition, an effective emergency 
response system requires the public to be provided with useful, timely, truthful, consistent 
and appropriate information promptly throughout a nuclear or radiological emergency.28  
</p>
<p>16. According to the independent investigation committee, the System for Prediction of 
Environment Emergency Dose Information (SPEEDI), a computer-based system for 
estimating potential radiation contamination based on real-time information, was not 
utilized by the Government in a timely and efficient manner.29 Consequently and contrary 
to the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for a nuclear 
emergency response,30 on 11 March 2011, only 20 per cent of Fukushima residents near the 
plant came to know of the accident.31 Most people within a radius of 10 km were informed 
of the accident only when evacuation orders were given on 12 March 2011.32  
</p>
<p>17. The evacuation zones designated by the Government on the basis of their proximity 
to the nuclear plant, rather than on scientific data indicating areas likely to be contaminated 
by the radioactive plume. Mandatory evacuation zones were periodically extended from an 
initial radius of three km from the Dai-ichi plant to 10, then later to 20.33 Voluntary 
evacuation was eventually endorsed within a radius of 20 to 20 km.34 Evacuation orders for 
some areas with high radiation doses were not issued until one month later. On 22 April 
2011, the Government issued evacuation orders for areas up to 50 km north-west of the 
plant, including Katsurao, Iitate, Namie and parts of Minami-soma and Kawamata, owing 
to the high-dose radiation detected in the area35 caused by winds carrying radioactive 
material from the plant. People in these areas thus remained exposed to high-dose radiation 
for a significant period. Even after SPEEDI was used, the resulting data were not made 
immediately available to the public.36  
</p>
<p>18. A coordinated and effective response at the local and national levels is a key goal of 
emergency preparedness.37 Japan&#8217;s emergency response did not meet up to the 
requirements of such an outcome. Poor coordination between the authorities was evident 
when the Fukushima authorities initially ordered evacuation from the 2 km area, after 
which the Government ordered a 3 km evacuation area.38 Owing to insufficient training in

Government as &#8220;nuclear disaster-related deaths&#8221;.39  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Distribution of iodine prophylaxis 
</b>19. The obligation to fulfil the right to health requires the State to take measures that 
assist individuals in realizing their right to health when they are unable to do so 
themselves.40 This is especially significant in cases of nuclear emergency, where the ill 
effects of radiological contamination, such as thyroid cancer, on the health of people are 
immense and long-term. In the aftermath of the nuclear accident in Chernobyl, more than 
4,000 cases of thyroid cancer were documented in Belarus, the Russian Federation and 
Ukraine from 1992 to 2002 among those who were children or adolescents at the time of 
the accident.41 In such circumstances, the State should make every effort to ensure that such 
goods as stable iodine tablets are made available and accessible, in a timely manner, to 
mitigate the effect of radioactive iodine on the health of the exposed population.  
</p>
<p>20. The Government, in its interim report to IAEA, estimated that was approximately 
1.6x1017 Bq of radioactive iodine (131I) was released into the environment.42 Exposure to 
radioactive iodine increases the risk of thyroid cancer, especially in children, infants and 
newborns.43 To block or reduce the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid gland, 
stable iodine is administered before or soon after the supposed intake of radioactive 
iodine.44 Although the optimal time for ingesting stable iodine is before a nuclear accident, 
it can reduce the intake of radioactive iodine by 50 per cent if administered a few hours 
after the accident.45  
</p>
<p>21. Regrettably, the Government did not give prompt orders for the administration of 
stable iodine after the nuclear accident. Even though some municipal authorities had stocks 
of stable iodine, they were not distributed. Some municipalities, such as Futaba and 
Tomioka, distributed stable iodine without orders from the Government.46 During the 
meeting with officials of the Fukushima Medical University, the Special Rapporteur 
learned that the decision to administer stable iodine had been delayed owing to 
apprehensions about the potential harmful side effects of iodine prophylaxis (it is an 
accepted position in radiological medicine, however, that even where the absorbed dose is 
less than 100mGy, stable iodine should be administered, as it does not entail any significant 
health hazards).47

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Monitoring the health effects of the nuclear accident  
</b></p>
<p>22. In the immediate and long-term aftermath of a nuclear accident, the right to health 
necessitates rigorous and prolonged monitoring of individual health, as the health effects of 
radiation exposure are not always immediately known or treatable. Though the experiences 
of the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents provided invaluable guidance, a narrow 
assessment of those accidents would not provide proper guidance for other nuclear 
accidents. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to monitor any increase in 
morbidity and leukaemia, since they have been detected among the survivors of Chernobyl 
and Three Mile Island.48 Owing to the limited knowledge about the health effects of long-
term exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, the Government&#8217;s orders for the resettlement 
of residents in areas with accumulated dosage of 20 mSv/year and lower should be 
followed by long-term health monitoring of affected people.  
</p>
<p>23. The health management survey in Fukushima is conducted by the prefecture 
authorities, which reportedly received 78.2 billion Yen from the Government, in 
coordination with the Fukushima Medical University. It comprises a basic survey and four 
detailed surveys. The basic survey estimates levels of external irradiation among residents. 
The detailed surveys include a thyroid ultrasound examination for all children in 
Fukushima aged up to 18 years, a comprehensive health check for all residents from the 
evacuation zones, an assessment of mental health and lifestyles of all residents from the 
evacuation zones, and a recording of all pregnancies and births among all women in the 
prefecture who were pregnant on 11 March 2011.49  
</p>
<p>24. Despite the funding reportedly given by the Government mentioned above, during 
his mission the Special Rapporteur heard concerns about the slow progress of survey 
implementation owing to a lack of capacity of the Fukushima authorities. He urges the 
Government to take the central role in the implementation of the survey and to make more 
financial and human resources available for its implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Basic health management survey 
</b>25. Three months after the nuclear accident, Fukushima authorities sent the health 
management survey to people who were residing in the prefecture on 11 March 2011.50 The 
objective was to evaluate individual radiation exposure from March to July 2011.51 Basic 
data collected will be used in health examinations of the target population and in their 
future long-term health care.52  
</p>
<p>26. The basic survey was designed to gather information about the whereabouts of 
individuals during various periods between 11 March and 11 July 2011, and the 
consumption of food, dairy products and water between 11 March and 31 March 2011.53 
The survey did not inquire into the health status of survey respondents at the time of the 
accident or in the period following the accident. A standard medical question regarding 
injuries (conventional, radiation-induced or both) around the time of the accident was

<p>missing from the survey.54 Unlike other similar surveys, it did not incorporate questions 
about the cancer history of respondents, such as cancer diagnosis, thyroid disorders, 
radiation treatment, prior exposure to ionizing radiation at work, or risk factors such as 
smoking.55
</p>
<p>27. Early capture of information is crucial to the effective monitoring of the human 
health impact of radiation exposure.56 The above-mentioned basic survey was, however, 
sent out only three months after the nuclear accident and relied solely on the memory of 
respondents about their activities around the time of the accident. Additionally, the size of 
the cohort is a significant factor in the analysis of the health effects of radiation exposure. 
For instance, in a survey conducted following the Three Mile Island incident, data from 92 
to 93 per cent of the affected population was captured within six weeks.57 The Fukushima 
authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that the response rate to their survey was as 
low as 23 per cent as at October 2012. The low response rate and the ambiguous nature of 
replies due to a three-month delay does not ensure the accurate capture and evaluation of 
the health effects of the nuclear accident. The Special Rapporteur therefore encourages the 
Government to take additional measures to ensure adequate health monitoring of affected 
residents. Moreover, given that the fallout from the accident seems to have reached 
prefectures other than Fukushima,58 he also urges the Government to expand the health 
monitoring to other affected prefectures where radiation exposure is higher than an 
additional 1 mSv/year in the effective dose. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Thyroid screening of children 
</b>28. The right to health requires the State to pay special attention to vulnerable groups, 
such as children. As children are most vulnerable to thyroid cancer caused by radioactive 
iodine intake, the Fukushima authorities initiated thyroid check-ups of all children who 
were up to 18 years of age at 11 March 2011. The Special Rapporteur commends the 
Government for this effort, and encourages it to explore other health effects of radiation on 
children, such as leukaemia, given that epidemiological studies have not ruled out the 
possibility of leukaemia in children who were exposed to radiation following the Chernobyl 
accident.59  
</p>
<p>29. The thyroid check-ups commenced in October 2011 and were scheduled to continue 
until March 2014, after which they will continue every two years until the individual is 20 
years of age; thereafter they will continue every fivc years.60 The results of the thyroid

<p>check-up are divided into four categories. An A1 outcome denotes no detection of any 
nodule or cyst; A2, that the size of the nodule present is less than 5 mm and/or the cyst is 
less than 20 mm. Children with A1 and A2 results are not eligible for a secondary 
examination. Result B indicates that the nodules and cysts are larger than 5.1 mm and/or 
20.1 mm respectively, and qualifies the child for secondary examination. C denotes urgent 
need for a secondary examination.61  
</p>
<p>30. Nodule size does not always reflect the degree of malignancy; the likelihood that a 
nodule is malignant is independent of the number of nodules and the size of the nodule.62 
Moreover, follow-up treatment for children in A2 categories will commence after two 
years. This may be too long a period to check the rate of growth of a tumour, which is an 
indicator of increased risk of malignancy.63According to the latest official information, 186 
of 38,114 children examined (0.5 per cent) in 2011 were in category B while, in 2012, there 
were 548 children out of 94,975 (0.6 per cent) in that category.64  
</p>
<p>31. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Japan Thyroid 
Association had been instructed against providing secondary examinations to children in 
the A2 category; parents and children would therefore have to wait for the second round of 
check-ups after March 2014 before being able to take any mitigating action against possible 
thyroid cancer. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to remove such barriers, 
which prevent people from exercising their right to health, and to ensure that children and 
parents are given access to second opinions and secondary health examinations, as required 
under the right to health. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that parents found it difficult to obtain 
access to the results of their children&#8217;s thyroid check-ups owing to bureaucracy and the 
cumbersome Freedom of Information Act procedure that Fukushima authorities insist on 
applying to parents&#8217; requests. Though confidentiality of information is an important aspect 
of the right to health, it should not become a barrier to information regarding one&#8217;s own 
health. In accordance with the right to health, the State is required to ensure an individual&#8217;s 
right to informed decisions regarding his/her health by giving them access to information 
relating to their health, which will have a bearing on their ability to make a decision.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Comprehensive health management survey 
</b>33. The comprehensive survey seeks to review health information, assess the incidence 
of various diseases and improve the health status of respondents. The target population is 
restricted to residents of the evacuation zone specified by the Government and residents of 
Yamakiya in Kawamata-machi, Namie-mach and Iitate-mura.65 Owing to the high levels of 
contamination in the soil, water and foodstuffs, including marine life, there is a possibility 
of internal irradiation.66 Following the Chernobyl accident, increased morbidity due to

<p>diseases of the endocrine, haematopoietic, circulatory and digestive systems were found 
among those affected.67 The comprehensive health management survey should therefore 
include check-ups for internal radiation exposure. Radioactive caesium has already been 
found in urine samples of people as young as 8 years in Japan.68 The survey does not, 
however, include urine tests for people under the age of 16.69 Tests70 should also be 
conducted to check for radioactive strontium,71 given that it presents a large risk for internal 
radiation exposure via ingestion of contaminated agricultural crops and may cause 
leukaemia.72  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur was informed that whole-body counters, used for measuring 
internal exposure to gamma radiation, were not available in health-care facilities throughout 
Fukushima prefecture, as would be required.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for having lowered the 
permissible limit of radionuclides in food for consumption.73 Careful scientific sampling is 
important to measure radioactivity in food. He however noted dissatisfaction among people 
about government sampling and preferred community measurement centres. It is important 
that the Government take steps to bridge the trust deficit with the people of Japan. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Mental health survey 
</b>36. The right to health extends not only to provision of medical health facilities, goods 
and services, but also to facilitating an environment within which the affected population is 
able to enjoy the right. The State is therefore under an obligation to mitigate the effect of 
the accident on the mental health of people by, inter alia, alleviating stress and anxiety 
related to radiation exposure and separation from families.  
</p>
<p>37. The effect of nuclear disasters on mental health was documented for the accidents in 
Three Mile Island and in Chernobyl.74 A year after the Three Mile Island accident, mothers 
were found to be at a high risk of experiencing clinical episodes of anxiety and 
depression.75 After the Chernobyl accident, women with young children were found to be

<p>most vulnerable to the mental health effects of the nuclear accident,76 and its continued 
impact on mental health was visible even six years after the accident.77 In a study 
conducted by IAEA, a significant amount of stress and anxiety was found to be related to 
the Chernobyl accident.78 Moreover, the rate of prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder 
is reportedly high among survivors of man-made disasters.79
</p>
<p>38. The Fukushima nuclear accident resulted in a breakdown in families and 
communities and feelings of isolation. The Special Rapporteur personally observed the 
anxiety and stress of evacuees, residents and their families that were related to the effect of 
radiation leakage on health, especially of children, the cost of evacuation and the loss of 
livelihoods, as well as the uncertainty of the future and the delays in receiving 
compensation, which hindered the rebuilding of their lives.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the mental and physical health of 
children has been especially affected by the lack of outdoor activities, safe areas to play and 
restrictions on activities in school. He calls on the Government to make quality mental 
health facilities, goods and services available and accessible to the residents of Fukushima, 
the evacuees and their families, with a focus on vulnerable groups, such as first responders 
and children. The Government should also provide and support programmes, such as the 
recuperation camps organized by non-governmental organizations to reduce stress and 
anxiety in the affected communities. 
</p>
<p>40. Even though the Government developed a detailed mental health survey for 
residents of the evacuation zone, the target population does not include all those affected by 
the accident. As in the case of the comprehensive health survey, the survey should at least 
include residents of the voluntary evacuation zone. Furthermore, the response rate to the 
survey was less than 50 per cent.80 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s 
effort to provide direct care to those who require it, as revealed by the survey. Efforts are 
nonetheless still required to ascertain the need for and deliver services to the rest of the 
target population. Although the survey enquires about the responder&#8217;s experience during 
the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident, it is important to record also any past 
experiences with radiation exposure, which may be an aggravating factor.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Pregnancy and birth survey 
</b>41. The obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health is a continuous 
obligation and extends to progeny. The pregnancy and birth survey, however, is based on 
the assumption that the Chernobyl accident did not significantly increase child anomalies or 
foetal deaths.81 The survey covers antenatal health, delivery records and the mental health 
of women.82 It does not include a provision for monitoring the health of either the foetus or 
the child after birth. With a view to ensuring the highest standard of physical and mental

<p>health, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to revise the survey and to take 
into account studies that have established a link between utero radiation exposure and 
mental disability.83 Further, the Government should explore the still unclear relation 
between in utero exposure and leukaemia.84  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Health of nuclear power plant workers 
</b>42. In the aftermath of Chernobyl, workers involved in the cleaning operations and first 
responders were exposed to the highest doses of radiation.85 During the Fukushima 
accident, an estimated 167 workers were exposed to more than 100mSv of radiation, a dose 
level recognized unequivocally to increase the risk of cancer.86 Two operators received 
doses above 600mSv.87 In addition, first responders face a high prevalence of post-
traumatic stress disorder in man-made disasters.88  
</p>
<p>43. The law requires a medical check-up for all workers who have worked in controlled 
areas every six months,89 while guidelines provide for additional medical check-ups of 
workers exposed to 50 mSv/year of radiation.90 The Special Rapporteur was nonetheless 
concerned to learn that the results are not always reported to the Government. To protect 
the right to health of workers, health check-ups need to be conducted regularly and their 
results reported. While acknowledging the Government&#8217;s reiteration that the health 
monitoring of nuclear workers is carried out under relevant laws and regulations, the 
Special Rapporteur notes concerns by nuclear power plant workers that such health 
monitoring is not conducted. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was informed that many workers employed in the nuclear 
power industry were poor and some even homeless, increasing their vulnerability. Even 
though the law91 requires compulsory medical check-ups for workers when they are hired, a 
significant number of workers, employed through layers of sub-contractors for short 
periods of time, are not provided with proper and effective monitoring of their health.92 The

<p>Government should take all measures to provide an environment that does not exacerbate 
their vulnerability and provide access to affordable and quality health facilities, goods and 
services at all times to all workers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Policy decisions and information on dose limits 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Evacuation zones  
</b>45. In December 2011, the Government categorized evacuation zones in areas affected 
by the nuclear accident. Areas with radiation dose exceeding 50mSv/year were designated 
restricted areas; entry in such areas is prohibited for five years. Entry has been restricted to 
areas with radiation dose between 20mSv/year to 50mSv/year, and residents are allowed to 
return for short periods, although staying overnight is prohibited. In areas where radiation 
exposure is lower than 20mSv/year, people are returning.  
</p>
<p>46. The Ordinance on the Prevention of Ionizing Radiation Hazards in Japan (art. 3) 
requires that areas where radiation dose exceeds 1.3mSv/quarterly be designated as 
controlled zones. The recommended limit of radiation exposure for the general public is 
1mSv/year.93 In Ukraine, the 1991 law on the status and social protection of citizens who 
suffered as a result of the Chernobyl catastrophe limited radiation dose for living and 
working without limitations to 1mSv/year.  
</p>
<p>47. The dose limit of 20mSv/year is being applied by the Government because of the 
nuclear emergency. In this regard, the Government seeks support from the letter received 
from the International Commission on Radiological Protection, in which it recommended a 
reference level of 1mSv/year to 20mSv/year for determining areas inhabitable after the 
accident.94 The recommendations made by the Commission were based on the principles of 
optimization and justification, according to which all actions of the Government should be 
based on maximizing good over harm.95 Such a risk-benefit analysis is not in consonance 
with the right to health framework, as it gives precedence to collective interests over 
individual rights. Under the right to health, the right of every individual has to be protected. 
Moreover, such decisions, which have a long-term impact on the physical and mental health 
of people, should be taken with their active, direct and effective participation.  
</p>
<p>48. The Government assured the Special Rapporteur that it was safe to inhabit areas 
where the radiation dose was up to 20mSv/year, as there was no excessive risk of cancer 
below 100mSv. Nonetheless, even the International Commission on Radiological 
Protection acknowledges the scientific possibility that the incidence of cancer or hereditary 
disorders will increase in direct proportion to an increase in radiation doses below 
100mSv.96 Furthermore, epidemiological studies monitoring the health effects of long-term

</b></p>
<p>exposure to low-ionizing radiation conclude that there is no low-threshold limit for excess 
radiation risk to non-solid cancers, such as leukaemia.97 The additive radiation risk for solid 
cancers continues to increase throughout life with a linear dose-response relationship.98  
</p>
<p>49. Health policies put in place by the State should be grounded in scientific evidence. 
Policies should be formulated so as to minimize the interference with the enjoyment of the 
right to health. In setting radiation dose limits, the right to health dictates limits that have 
the least impact on the right to health of people, taking into account the greater 
vulnerability of such groups as pregnant women and children. As the possibility of adverse 
health effects exists in low-dose radiation, evacuees should be advised to return only when 
the radiation dose has been reduced as far as possible and to levels below 1 mSv/year. In 
the meantime, the Government should continue to provide financial support and subsidies 
to all evacuees so that they may make a voluntary decision to return to their homes or 
remain evacuated.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Government monitoring stations 
</b>50. The State should facilitate access to information about radiation levels in the 
affected areas to allow people to make informed decisions that will have a bearing on their 
health. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to observe that the Government had set up 
stations to monitor the ambient air dose in Fukushima prefecture. The Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur that around 3,200 monitoring stations had been installed in 
the prefecture. The air dose measured by these fixed stations only reflects, however, the 
radiation dose in the immediate vicinity of the instrument. Readings by fixed monitoring 
stations do not reflect the actual and varied dosage levels in nearby areas, which may be 
higher than in the immediate vicinity of the station. Reliance on unrepresentative 
information may expose people, especially such vulnerable groups as children, to higher 
radiation levels. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur observed substantial variance, 
including in schools and public areas used by children, as well as radiation &#8220;hot spots&#8221; 
close to monitoring stations that were not reflected. Such incidents have regrettably led 
many people to doubt the reliability of Government monitoring stations.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Information in school textbooks 
</b>51. The State should ensure that accurate and scientifically sound information on 
radiation and radioactivity is provided to children and, where appropriate, their parents to 
facilitate informed decision-making regarding health. Additionally, respecting the right to 
health requires the State to refrain from misrepresenting information in health-related 
matters. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the Fukushima official curriculum for 
compulsory radiation education in public schools. The supplementary reading and 
presentation materials mentioned that there was no clear evidence of high risk of disease, 
including cancer, when exposed for a short time to radiation levels of 100mSv and below, 
thus giving the impression that doses below 100mSv are safe. As noted above, this is not 
consistent with the law in Japan, international standards or epidemiological research. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur notes that the textbooks do not mention the increased 
vulnerability of children to the health effects of radiation. Such information may give 
children and parents a false sense of security, which may result in the exposure of children

<p>to high levels of radiation. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure 
accurate representation of the health effects associated with the nuclear accident and to 
include methods of preventing and controlling health problems in a manner that is effective, 
age-appropriate and easy to understand.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Decontamination  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Decontamination policy 
</b>52. The Act on Special Measures concerning the Handling of Radioactive Pollution was 
promulgated in August 2011 to create a legal framework for decontamination activities; the 
basic principles and fundamentally important regulations of the Act did not come into 
force, however, until January 2012. The Act covers the planning and implementation of 
decontamination work, including the collection, transfer, temporary storage and final 
disposal of contaminated material.99 The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the 
Government&#8217;s decontamination efforts and those of municipalities under the basic policy 
for emergency response on decontamination Work. Decontamination policies should have, 
however, already been a part of the regulatory framework for the nuclear power industry.100 
This would have enabled the Government to undertake decontamination activities earlier 
than November 2011.  
</p>
<p>53. Areas for decontamination extend beyond Fukushima prefecture and are prioritized 
by radiation levels, with a focus on living environments for children.101 The aim is to halve 
exposure in areas with radiation levels of less than 20mSv/year for the general public, and 
to reduce it by 60 per cent for children, by August 2013. Exposure is to be reduced to less 
than 20mSv/year by March 2014 in areas with radiation between 20mSv/year and 
50mSv/year. Demonstration projects were established to secure the safety of workers in 
areas with radiation above 50mSv/year. The long-term goal is to reduce radiation levels to 
below 1mSv/year.102  
</p>
<p>54. Although the right to health is subject to progressive realization, the obligation to 
formulate and take deliberate, concrete and targeted steps is an immediate obligation of the 
State. It is regrettable that there are neither specific measures nor a timeline for 
decontamination beyond 2013 and to levels less than 1mSv/year. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government to urgently formulate a long-term decontamination policy with the 
aim of reducing radiation to less than 1mSv/year at the earliest.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur notes the special attention paid by the Government to such 
vulnerable groups as children when conducting decontamination work by prioritizing the 
decontamination of schools and playgrounds. Isolated decontamination of schools and 
playgrounds is, however, not sufficient, given that winds can deposit radiation from 
surrounding areas on sites that have already been decontaminated. The decontamination of 
schools and playgrounds should therefore include surrounding areas, such as roads, ditches

<p>and fields, which can be radiation hot spots. The decontamination policy should in fact 
address radiation hot spots as a priority, because they can exist even within areas where the 
radiation level is lower than 20 mSv/y.  
</p>
<p>56. While the Special Rapporteur notes that the Government is encouraging 
participation of the community in decontamination work, he recalls, however, that the State 
is mandated to fulfil the right to health by giving necessary information and protective 
equipment to individuals engaged in hazardous activities.103 While the Act on Special 
Measures requires provision of appropriate information or equipment for individuals 
engaging in decontamination activities, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in some 
areas, these requirements were not strictly followed. He therefore calls on the Government 
to provide information, safety equipment and appropriate protective gear to residents who 
voluntarily undertake decontamination activities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Storage of contaminated materials  
</b>57. Decontamination activities involving the removal of 5 to 10 cm of topsoil104 pose 
challenges for the Government, in particular with regard to the safe storage of contaminated 
soil. Authorities currently store radioactive debris in residential areas in sandbags covered 
with plastic or bury it, including under playgrounds, in protective containers. During his 
visit, the Special Rapporteur did not find any signs informing people of the presence of 
radioactive materials in these areas, contrary to the right to health.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was informed that temporary and definitive storage and 
disposal facilities would be prepared to deal with contaminated waste, estimated to be 2.3 
million tonnes;105 there were no concrete plans, however, for the storage of the radioactive 
debris. As contaminated waste is currently stored in residential areas and under 
playgrounds, thereby posing a health hazard to residents, establishing temporary storage 
facilities away from residential areas is urgently required. The Government should 
formulate a timeline and take urgent measures to establish temporary and definitive waste 
storage and disposal facilities, with the active participation of the local community in the 
decision-making process.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Transparency and accountability  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Transparency and independence in the regulatory framework 
</b>59. In their reports, both the Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission 
and the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the TEPCO Fukushima Nuclear Power 
Stations, set up by the Parliament and the Government respectively, criticise the close 
association between the regulatory bodies and the Federation of Electric Power Companies 
in Japan, which greatly reduced the independence of the regulatory bodies.106 As a result,

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>the regulatory bodies failed to hold TEPCO accountable for non-compliance with domestic 
and international safety standards, thus compromising the safety of the Dai-ichi plant.107  
</p>
<p>60. Transparency in governance and in implementing national policies and regulatory 
frameworks is a key factor in the right to health. Effective transparency and independence 
of governing and regulatory authorities also ensure accountability. The Special Rapporteur 
notes that the Government, having recognized the need for independence and transparency, 
created the Nuclear Regulation Authority.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur stresses that information and data collected by the Nuclear 
Regulation Authority regarding domestic regulations and compliance of nuclear operators 
with domestic and international safety standards should be made publicly available to 
facilitate independent monitoring and accountability within the Authority and the nuclear 
power industry as a whole. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Accountability of TEPCO 
</b>62. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that, in Japan, nuclear operators are 
strictly and absolutely liable for any injury resulting from nuclear operations.108 This 
renders private non-State actors liable for violating the right to health of individuals and is 
consistent with the State&#8217;s obligation to protect the right to health.  
</p>
<p>63. The acquisition by the Government of a majority of shares in TEPCO in June 2012 
has, however, arguably helped TEPCO to effectively avoid any accountability and liability 
for damages. Payment of compensation is made from government funds, funded by 
taxpayers. The Special Rapporteur was informed that TEPCO would have to repay the 
Government eventually. Nevertheless, under the current arrangement, the taxpayers may 
have to continue to bear the burden of nuclear damage, for which TEPCO alone should be 
liable.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Compensation and relief measures 
</b></p>
<p>64. Where the right to health has been violated, victims should have access to effective 
remedies, including adequate reparation and compensation. The provision of compensation 
and other forms of relief are also essential to the recovery of individuals affected by the 
nuclear accident.  
</p>
<p>65. After the nuclear accident, TEPCO provided 120 billion Yen in financial security for 
claims,109 even though the compensation costs estimated by TEPCO itself at around 4,500 
billion Yen. The Government therefore established the public-private Nuclear Damage 
Liability Facilitation Fund in September 2011.110  
</p>
<p>66. The Dispute Reconciliation Committee for Nuclear Damage Compensation was 
created to formulate guidelines for payment of compensation owing to the lack of 
guidelines in the existing Compensation Act.111 The Special Rapporteur notes that the 
original compensation application forms comprised around 60 pages and 2,215 sections,

<p>and came with a 158-page instruction manual.112 He was also informed of the delays caused 
at the Dispute Settlement Centre, which hindered the availability of compensation. While 
the application forms have since been streamlined, the Government should now address the 
concerns frequently raised by affected persons regarding attempts by TEPCO to reduce 
compensation levels and delay settlement.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur commends the passing of the<b> </b>Statute on Protection and 
Support for the Children and other Victims of Tokyo Electric Power Company Nuclear 
Power Plant Disaster (Victims Protection Law), which recognizes the right of victims to 
choose whether to evacuate. It includes persons voluntarily evacuating or living in areas 
outside Government-designated zones, whose relief needs were reportedly neglected. The 
law also contains provisions relating to the long-term impact of exposure to radiation on 
health<b>.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, despite the adoption of the Victims 
Protection Law in June 2012, implementing instruments have not yet been adopted. In 
implementing the law, clarification is required with regard to &#8220;covered areas&#8221; under article 
</p><p>8. The Special Rapporteur believes that such areas should include those where radiation 
levels exceed 1mSv/year. As the exact impact of long-term exposure to low-dose ionizing 
radiation on health cannot be accurately predicted, the implementing measures should also 
expressly provide for free, life-long health screening and medical treatment relating to 
radiation exposure for all affected persons. The 20-year time limit contained in the Civil 
Code should not apply to financial assistance for medical care consequent to the nuclear 
accident.  
</p>
<p>69. The obligation to fulfil the right to health requires the State to ensure the provision 
of the underlying determinants of health by, inter alia, taking positive measures that 
facilitate the enjoyment of the right. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take 
such measures to implement the Victims Protection Law, and to provide funding for 
relocation, housing, employment, education and other essential support needed by those 
who chose to evacuate, stay or return to any area where radiation exceeds 1mSv/year. 
These measures should include relief packages reflecting the cost of rebuilding lives.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Participation of vulnerable groups and affected communities 
</b></p>
<p>70. The right to health requires the State to pay special attention to the needs of 
vulnerable groups. The State is also under an immediate obligation to prevent 
discrimination, especially against vulnerable groups in its policies or practice, even during 
times of resource constraint. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>71. As at August 2011, 146,520 people had evacuated from Fukushima prefecture.113 
Owing to frequent changes in evacuation orders, more than 10,000 people had to change 
evacuation centres three or more times, with some people having to move as many as 10 
times.114 Even after evacuation orders were given on 12 March 2011 for areas within a 20 
km radius of the Dai-ichi plant, approximately 840 hospital and nursing home patients

<p>remained until 13 March 2011.115 In addition, 60 hospital patients died during 
evacuation.116 The stress, ill-health and deaths could have been prevented had coordinated 
evacuation orders been taken and plans been in place. In this context, mapping vulnerable 
groups and encouraging broad community engagement may help to create more appropriate 
emergency responses with respect to vulnerable communities.117
</p>
<p>72. Older persons, children, women and persons with disabilities are more susceptible to 
the ill effects of disasters.118 During the visit, members of such groups shared their 
grievances with the Special Rapporteur, mainly that they had had no say in decisions 
affecting them. He was also pained to learn that evacuation centres often did not have an 
accessible environment for persons with disabilities and women, including women with 
young children. Despite the existence of the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality 2010, 
which promotes gender equality in disaster prevention and response, women faced greater 
disadvantage in evacuation centres because Plan regulations had not been fully 
implemented.119    
</p>
<p>73. Participation of the population at all stages of decision-making processes at the 
national and community levels is a critical feature of the right to health framework. Health-
related laws and policies should be instituted only with the direct, active and effective 
involvement of communities, given that they are the most affected by these decisions. The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take this opportunity to ensure the effective 
involvement of communities in the health management survey. Community participation 
would also help the Government to address the concerns of the people more effectively, 
thereby creating a more efficient health system.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for having ensured community 
participation in the Victims Protection Law. The Government should continue to facilitate 
broad-based participation and effective engagement of affected communities with a view to 
addressing their concerns.<b> </b>The participation of affected communities also encourages 
community-led awareness raising and initiatives. Community participation should include 
the participation of vulnerable groups, as it is crucial for their empowerment and the 
creation of an inclusive society.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to involve individuals and 
community organizations in current and future nuclear and health policies, including in data 
collection and radiation monitoring, planning evacuation centres, designing health 
management surveys, decisions regarding radiation levels and evacuation zones, and in 
setting compensation amounts.
