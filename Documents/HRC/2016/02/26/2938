<p><i>Noting with interest </i>relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human right 
to safe drinking water and sanitation, including the Abuja Declaration, adopted at the first 
Africa-South America Summit, in 2006, the message from Beppu, adopted at the first Asia-
Pacific Water Summit, in 2007, the Delhi Declaration, adopted at the third South Asian 
Conference on Sanitation, in 2008, the Sharm el-Sheikh Final Document, adopted at the 
Fifteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Movement of Non-
Aligned Countries, in 2009, and the Colombo Declaration, adopted at the fourth South 
Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2011, </p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the commitments made by the international community to achieve 
fully the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing in that context the resolve of Heads 
of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to 
halve, by 2015, the proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe drinking water, and 
to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as agreed in the Plan of 
Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of 
</p>
<p>Implementation&#8221;) and the outcome document adopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting of 
the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals 
entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;, </p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>World Health Assembly resolution 64/24 of May 2011, in which the 
Assembly urged Member States to, inter alia, &#8220;ensure that national health strategies 
contribute to the realization of water- and sanitation-related Millennium Development 
Goals while coming in support to the progressive realization of the human right to water 
and sanitation that entitles everyone, without discrimination, to water and sanitation that is 
sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable for personal and domestic 
uses&#8221;, </p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular</i> paragraph 5 (<i>f</i>) of Human Rights Council resolution 16/2, in 
which the Council encouraged the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation, in fulfilling her mandate, to make recommendations for goals beyond 
the 2015 Millennium Development Goals process with special regard to the full realization 
of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and also to continue to make more 
recommendations that could help the realization of the Millennium Development Goals, in 
particular of Goal 7, as appropriate, </p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that approximately 780 million people still lack access to 
improved water sources and that more than 2.5 billion people do not have access to 
improved sanitation as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund in their 2012 Joint Monitoring Programme report, concerned that these 
figures do not fully capture the water safety aspect and equity, equality and non-
discrimination issues as indicated by that report, and therefore underestimate the numbers 
of those without access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and alarmed that, every year, 
approximately 1.5 million children under five years of age die and 443 million school days 
are lost as a result of water- and sanitation-related diseases, </p>


<p><i>Affirming</i> the need to focus on local and national perspectives in considering the 
issue, leaving aside questions of international watercourse law and all transboundary water 
issues, 
</p>
<p>1.<i> Welcomes </i>the recognition of the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the reaffirmation 
by the latter that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the 
right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as the right to life and human 
dignity; 
</p>
<p>2.<i> Also welcomes </i>the commitments of States regarding the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development on 22 June 2012; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further welcomes </i>the fact that, according to the 2012 Joint Monitoring 
Programme report, the Millennium Development Goal target relating to the reduction by 50 
per cent of people without access to an improved water source has been met five years 
before its deadline of 2015, insists that much remains to be done on safety, equity, equality 
and non-discrimination issues, and regrets the fact that the Millennium Development Goal 
target on sanitation is still one of the most off-track of the United Nations development 
agenda beyond 2015; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes </i>the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations 
conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and 
compilation of good practices, and the undertaking of country missions; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes </i>the second annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted 
to the General Assembly on financing for the realization of the right to water and 
sanitation,1 and takes notes with appreciation of her recommendations and clarifications 
with regard to questions of financing the implementation of the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Takes note </i>of the fourth annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to 
the Human Rights Council;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/21/42. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the negative impact of discrimination, 
marginalization and stigmatization on the full enjoyment of the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms </i>that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international 
assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their 
available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of 
legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Takes note </i>of the finding made by the Special Rapporteur that ensuring safe 
drinking water and sanitation for all will require considerably more resources; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Also takes note </i>of the finding made by the Special Rapporteur that better 
targeted use of existing resources to prioritize the most excluded and marginalized, as well 
</p>

<p>as more transparent budgets and better coordination, will help to realize fully the human 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon </i>States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To prioritize in an appropriate way funding for safe drinking water and 
sanitation, with a particular focus on extending access to the unserved or underserved, 
including measures to identify the most marginalized, excluded and disadvantaged persons 
in terms of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, to develop the capacity of decision 
makers and practitioners for implementing strategies and concepts specifically focusing on 
the sustainable provision of safe drinking water and sanitation to the unserved poor, and to 
develop specific initiatives that are more likely to reach the most marginalized and 
disadvantaged and improve their situation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To consider increasing the percentage of international aid allocated to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, and to incorporate a human rights-based approach; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To monitor the affordability of safe drinking water and sanitation in order to 
determine whether specific measures are needed to ensure that household contributions are 
and remain affordable by means of, inter alia, effective regulation and oversight of all 
service providers; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To promote transparency of budgets and other funding, as well as of 
programmes and projects of all actors in the water and sanitation sector, in order to ensure 
an adequate basis for planning with regard to the most vulnerable and marginalized sectors 
of society and in order to inform decision-making and policymaking processes in both 
public and private sectors; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To consult with communities on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To ensure the sustainability of access to water and sanitation by, inter alia, 
capacity-building of Government authorities at all levels with regard to their responsibilities 
in the service delivery chain, adequate budgeting of costs, including costs of maintenance, 
and establishing an adequate and effective regulatory system; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Invites </i>States to continue to promote, at all levels, including at the highest 
level, the full realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in 
forthcoming national, regional and international initiatives; </p>
<p>13.<i> Stresses </i>the important role of the international cooperation and technical 
assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and 
international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the 
timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development 
partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing 
development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue to make contributions to the 
discussions on the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015, in particular on the 
integration of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation and, in this regard, calls 
upon States to build the post-2015 framework on the values outlined in the Millennium 
Declaration around the fundamental principles of respect for human rights, equality and 
sustainability, and to integrate the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation into the 
international development agenda beyond 2015; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Encourages </i>all Governments to continue to respond favourably to requests 
by the Special Rapporteur for visits and information, to follow up effectively on the </p>


<p>recommendations of the mandate holder and to make available information on measures 
taken in this regard; 
</p>
<p>16.<i> Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue to report, on an annual basis, to 
the Human Rights Council and to submit an annual report to the General Assembly; 
</p>
<p>17.<i> Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to facilitate, including through 
engagement with relevant stakeholders, the provision of technical assistance in the area of 
the implementation of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>18.<i> Requests </i>the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the resources and assistance 
necessary for the effective fulfilment of her mandate; 
</p>
<p>19.<i> Decides to continue </i>its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item and in accordance with its programme of work.
