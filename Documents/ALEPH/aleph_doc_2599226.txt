Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 24, 2016, Foresight Energy LLC and Foresight Energy Finance Corporation (wholly
owned subsidiaries of Foresight Energy LP (the “Partnership”)) (together, the “Issuers”), together
with Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, the successor trustee (the “Existing Senior Notes
Trustee”) for the Issuers’ 7.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Existing Senior Notes”), entered
into a supplemental indenture (the “Existing Senior Notes Supplemental Indenture”) providing for
an amendment (the “Proposed Amendment”) to the indenture governing the Existing Senior
Notes (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Existing Senior
Notes Indenture”).
As previously disclosed by the Partnership, the required noteholder consents under the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture for the Proposed Amendment were obtained on August 11, 2016.
Accordingly, upon the Issuers obtaining the required noteholder consents for the Proposed
Amendment, such noteholder consents became irrevocable in accordance with the terms of the
related consent solicitation.
Upon its effectiveness, the Proposed Amendment will amend Section 8.05 of the Existing Senior
Notes Indenture (entitled “Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture”) by deleting, in its entirety,
subsection (2) thereof, which currently requires (as a condition precedent for the satisfaction and
discharge of the obligations in respect of the Existing Senior Notes and the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture) the absence of an existing Default or Event of Default (each as defined in the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture) on the date that an Issuer or guarantor deposits funds with the Existing
Senior Notes Trustee for such satisfaction and discharge (and requires further that such deposit
not result in a Default or Event of Default under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or a default
under any other instrument to which an Issuer or guarantor is a party or by which an Issuer or
guarantor is bound).
The Supplemental Indenture has been executed and delivered by the Issuers and the Existing
Senior Notes Trustee and the conditional Proposed Amendment to Section 8.05 of the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture that is contained within the Existing Senior Notes Supplemental
Indenture will become effective (and shall be deemed effective immediately prior to) the
consummation of the previously disclosed exchange offer that is currently being conducted as
part of the Partnership’s proposed restructuring.
The foregoing descriptions of the Proposed Amendment, the Existing Senior Notes
Supplemental Indenture and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the full text of the Existing Senior Notes Supplemental Indenture and the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture, each of which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 10.1 and
Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements and information in this Current Report on Form 8-K may constitute “forward-
looking statements.” The words “propose,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,”
“foresee,” “outlook,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “seek,” “approximately,”
“predict,” “anticipate,” “should,” “would,” “could” or other similar expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. These forward-
looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future
developments and their potential effect on us. While management believes that these forward-
looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that the future
developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All comments concerning the
proposed restructuring referenced herein are based on the current state of the ongoing related
negotiations.
The successful consummation of the restructuring transactions is subject to various conditions,
including the successful negotiation of definitive documentation and other conditions that are not
within the control of the Partnership or its affiliates. There can be no assurances that the
Partnership or any of its affiliates will be able to successfully negotiate or implement any of the
proposed restructuring transactions, or if they are able to do so, that such negotiation or
implementation will be consistent with the terms described herein.
We continue to experience substantial financial, business, operational and reputational risks that
threaten our ability to continue as a going concern and could materially affect our present
expectations and projections. For additional information regarding known material factors that
could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in or implied by forward-looking
statements, please see the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in the Partnership’s: (i) Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016; and
(ii) subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which are made
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by law.
