<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 13/9, decided, in the context of the 
follow-up to the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
(A/HRC/12/48, hereinafter the FFM report), &#8220;to establish a committee of independent 
experts in international humanitarian and human rights laws to monitor and assess any 
domestic, legal or other proceedings undertaken by both the Government of Israel and the 
Palestinian side, in the light of General Assembly resolution 64/254, including the 
independence, effectiveness, genuineness of these investigations and their conformity with 
international standards&#8221;. In accordance with this directive, the Committee of independent 
experts (hereinafter the Committee) submitted its first report to the Council (A/HRC/15/50) 
at its fifteenth session. 
</p>
<p>2. Thereafter, in its resolution 15/6, the Human Rights Council decided &#8220;to renew and 
resume the mandate of the Committee of independent experts, established pursuant to 
Council resolution 13/9&#8221;. The Council requested that the Committee submit its updated 
report to the Council at its sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>3. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights appointed Judge Mary 
McGowan Davis, a former Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York and 
former federal prosecutor, as Chair of the Committee. The other member was Judge 
Lennart Aspegren, formerly a Judge at the Svea Court of Appeal, Director-General for 
Legal and International Affairs at different Swedish Ministries, Justice at the Supreme 
Social Insurance Court, and Judge at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. 
</p>
<p>4. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
established a secretariat to support the Committee. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its 
resolution 15/6. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate and methodology  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Committee, in its initial report (A/HRC/15/50) submitted to the Human Rights 
Council at its fifteenth session, interpreted its mandate by reading Human Rights Council 
resolution 13/9 in conjunction with General Assembly resolution 64/254, in which the 
General Assembly reiterated its call upon the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side 
to conduct investigations &#8220;that are independent, credible and in conformity with 
international standards into the serious violations of international humanitarian and 
international human rights law reported by the [United Nations] Fact-Finding Mission [on 
the Gaza conflict], towards assuring accountability and justice&#8221;. As set forth in that report, 
the Committee understood &#8220;domestic, legal or other proceedings&#8221; to refer to investigations, 
disciplinary proceedings and prosecutions undertaken by either military or civil justice 
systems in Israel and on the Palestinian side. Although the Committee&#8217;s primary focus was 
on proceedings related to the serious violations alleged in the FFM report, it determined 
that its mandate was not restricted to these events and that it could review proceedings 
pertaining to &#8220;any incident connected to the military operations in Gaza&#8221; (A/HRC/15/50, 
para. 6). </p>


<p>7. Regarding the temporal scope of the mandate, for the current phase of its work the 
Committee has concentrated on identifying and analyzing relevant information issued or 
released since the filing of its first report in September 2010. 
</p>
<p>8. Taking into account that the Human Rights Council in its resolution 15/6 &#8220;renews 
and resumes&#8221; the mandate of the Committee, the Committee understands its current 
mandate to be exactly as previously defined and reported to the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology  
</b></p>
<p>9. Following the renewal of its mandate, the Committee updated its terms of reference 
in order to reflect its approach to the assignment given to it by the Council. The Committee 
further established its working methodology. 
</p>
<p>10. Specifically, the Committee sought to discharge its mandate by analyzing 
information in the public domain and by supplementing this information through 
consultations with identified stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>11. The Committee undertook a mission to Amman on 20 and 21 February 2011 to meet 
with Palestinian officials and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). While the 
Committee had planned to carry out a separate mission to Gaza, it was unable to gain 
access to Gaza through Israel, due to the lack of authorization from the Government of 
Israel, or through Egypt, in view of the security situation prevailing there during the weeks 
preceding the preparation of the present report. 
</p>
<p>12. The Committee continues to view the relevant government authorities as among the 
most important sources of information about the progress of investigations called for by the 
General Assembly and sought their cooperation from the initial stages of its work. 
</p>
<p>13. On 13 January 2011, the Committee wrote to the Permanent Representative of Israel 
requesting a meeting and met with him on 26 January 2011. Although the Permanent 
Representative received the Committee members most cordially, he explained that it was 
the policy of the Government of Israel to refuse to cooperate with any aspect of the 
&#8220;Goldstone process&#8221;. Further, he relayed his Government&#8217;s denial of the Committee&#8217;s 
request for permission to enter Israel in order to speak to government officials and victims 
of rocket attacks launched from Gaza, and to access the West Bank and Gaza through Israel 
to interview victims and relevant authorities with respect to the operations in Gaza 
codenamed by Israel &#8220;Operation Cast Lead&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. On 13 January 2011, the Committee wrote to the Permanent Representative of the 
Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine seeking a meeting and on 26 January 2011 the 
Committee met with him. With the assistance of the Permanent Observer Mission, the 
Committee held discussions in Amman with the Minister of Justice, the General Prosecutor, 
and the Chairman and two members of the Palestinian Independent Investigation 
Commission established pursuant to the FFM report. As a follow-up to these discussions, 
on 3 March 2011, the Committee wrote to the General Prosecutor and the Minister of 
Justice requesting additional information. On 10 March 2011, the Minister of Justice 
submitted supplemental materials. Likewise, the General Prosecutor forwarded documents 
on 10 March 2011 related to criminal investigations undertaken by his office. The 
Committee also held a teleconference on 10 March 2011 with members of the Palestinian 
Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR).  
</p>
<p>15. The Committee is grateful to the Palestinian Authority for the extensive cooperation 
provided throughout its term.  
</p>
<p>16. In addition, to obtain the fullest information available on investigations undertaken 
by the Palestinian side, the Committee contacted the de facto authorities in Gaza on 24 </p>


<p>February 2011 requesting specific information on investigations undertaken in response to 
the FFM report. On 8 March 2011, the de facto authorities asked the Committee for 
additional time in which to submit the information and the Committee agreed to extend the 
deadline. The de facto Gaza authorities sent a document on 13 March, with two annexes, in 
response to the Committee&#8217;s detailed list of questions. 
</p>
<p>17. The Committee met with a number of NGO representatives in Geneva on 27 January 
2011 and in Amman on 20 and 21 February 2011. NGOs also made written submissions to 
the Committee and during teleconferences with the Committee members further 
documented incidents they had brought to the attention of authorities in Israel and on the 
Palestinian side. 
</p>
<p>18. The Committee also interviewed Israeli and Palestinian victims and witnesses. On 9 
and 14 March 2011, the Committee held video- and teleconferences with Israeli victims and 
witnesses, who provided information on the human and material damage suffered as a 
direct consequence of rocket attacks launched from the Gaza Strip. These individuals 
described their injuries and the continuing physical and psychological effects of living near 
the border in constant apprehension of further attacks. They also noted their complete 
inability to gain redress for these crimes.  
</p>
<p>19. On 15 March 2011, the Committee held video- and teleconferences with Palestinian 
victims, who recounted their first-hand experience with Israeli criminal investigations into 
incidents reported by the FFM. These witnesses detailed their frustration with the Israeli 
investigating authorities and gave articulate voice to their perception that Israeli justice 
mechanisms were completely ineffective and non-existent. Although these victims and 
witnesses had suffered serious injuries during Operation Cast Lead and had cooperated 
fully with investigators, after two years they have heard absolutely nothing with respect to 
the status of their cases &#8211; apart from one family that had learned in an official government 
report that the criminal investigation into the killing of their young children had been closed 
without elucidation of the circumstances that led to such a tragedy.  
</p>
<p>20. On 25 February 2011, the Committee held a teleconference with Noam Shalit, who 
reminded the Committee of the continuing isolation and captivity of his son, Gilad Shalit, 
who has had no communication with his family, nor has he been allowed visits by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to monitor his detention conditions since he was 
captured and detained during an incursion into Israel in June 2006. Mr. Shalit expressed 
concern about the psychological and physical well-being of his son after five years in 
detention and appealed for his immediate release. 
</p>
<p>21. The totality of this information has provided the basis for the Committee&#8217;s efforts to 
implement its mandate &#8220;to assess domestic, legal or other proceedings undertaken by Israel 
and the Palestinian side.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>22. The Committee carried out its work under considerable challenges and constraints. 
In particular, given that the Committee did not travel to Israel, the West Bank or Gaza, it 
was unable to meet with a number of persons who could have supplied first-hand, updated 
information as to the status and impact of investigations and legal proceedings undertaken 
by the respective parties into the violations alleged in the FFM report. Moreover, the 
Committee worked under strict time limitations in order to meet the time frame imposed on 
it by the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Applicable law and standards  
</b></p>
<p>23. In its previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/15/50), the Committee 
extensively analyzed the legal framework and standards applicable in the context of the </p>


<p>Committee&#8217;s mandate. In the Committee&#8217;s view, that legal analysis remains valid and does 
not require further elaboration. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Investigations conducted 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Military operations in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to available information, the Government of Israel has conducted some 
400 command investigations in relation to Operation Cast Lead. Reports indicate that the 
Military Advocate General (MAG) has opened 52 criminal investigations into allegations of 
wrongdoing.1 Of these 52 investigations, thus far three cases have been submitted to 
prosecution; two have resulted in convictions, while the trial of one case is still ongoing. 
</p>
<p>25. Focusing on incidents discussed in the previous report, the Committee could 
ascertain significant changes in the status of only two cases since September 2010. The first 
change concerns the completed inquiry into the alleged shooting and killing of Matar Abu 
Halima (aged 17) and Muhammad Hekmat Abu Halima (aged 16), and the wounding of 
Omar Abu Halima, on 4 January 2009 (A/HRC/12/48, paras. 788-801). The incident 
reportedly occurred as the young men were transporting wounded family members to the 
hospital and after they had complied with soldiers&#8217; orders to stop (ibid., para. 800). 
Notwithstanding difficulties created by discrepancies in testimonies given by Israeli 
Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers, the MAG ultimately concluded that the soldiers &#8220;acted 
lawfully in light of a perceived threat&#8221;.2 In addition, an apparently extensive investigation 
into allegations that earlier on the same day the family home had been hit by a white 
phosphorous shell, killing five and injuring four &#8211; which included interviews with family 
members present at the time of the alleged shelling, consultations with technical experts, 
and a review of medical records &#8211; ended with the determination that &#8220;it was unclear what 
ammunition had hit the house and who had launched it&#8221;.3  
</p>
<p>26. The second case refers to the killing of Majda and Rayya Hajaj (see A/HRC/12/48, 
paras. 764-769). The Committee learned that a soldier was indicted before a military court 
on charges of manslaughter in relation to the deliberate targeting of an individual waving a 
white flag, without orders or authorization to do so.4 The indictment reportedly refers to the 
death of an unknown person, as the evidence gathered did not establish sufficient 
connections between the information provided in Palestinian testimonies &#8211; that the shooting 
victims at Juhr ad-Dik on January 4, 2009 were the two Hajaj women &#8211; and the admissions 
made by the soldier &#8211; which referred to the killing of a single man.5 According to media 
reports, the trial was opened on 1 August 2010 but the reading of the indictment was 
immediately postponed at the request of the defense,6 which demanded that the trial be 
suspended while the Military Police pursue allegations that an IDF officer had attempted to 
block the investigation by not submitting the results of a probe into the incident to his

<p>superior officers and to the MAG.7 The trial is currently in recess while the authorities 
investigate further. 
</p>
<p>27. The Committee does not have sufficient information to establish the current status of 
the ongoing criminal investigations into the killings of Ateya and Ahmad al-Samouni, the 
attack on the Wa&#8217;el al-Samouni house and the shooting of Iyad Samouni. This is of 
considerable concern: reportedly 24 civilians were killed and 19 were injured in the related 
incidents on 4 and 5 January 2009 (A/HRC/12/48, paras. 706 to 744). Furthermore, the 
events may be connected both to the actions and decisions of soldiers on the ground and of 
senior officers located in a war room, as well as to broader issues implicating the rules of 
engagement and the use of drones. There are also reports indicating that the MAG decision 
to investigate was opposed by the then head of the IDF southern command.8 Media reports 
further inform that a senior officer, who was questioned &#8220;under caution&#8221; and whose 
promotion was put on hold,9 told investigators that he was not warned that civilians were at 
the location.10 However, some of those civilians had been ordered there by IDF soldiers 
from that same officer&#8217;s unit, and air force officers allegedly informed him of the possible 
presence of civilians.11 Media sources also report that the special command investigation, 
initiated 10 months after the incidents,12 did not conclude that there had been anything out 
of the ordinary in the strike.13 As of 24 October 2010, the MAG had apparently not 
determined whether or not the officer would stand trial.14 
</p>
<p>28. The Committee notes that the MAG is apparently reviewing the completed special 
command investigation into the treatment of Palestinian detainees and is evaluating whether 
criminal or disciplinary measures are necessary. The Committee understands that this 
command investigation examined broad issues related to the treatment of Palestinian 
detainees,15 including those related to the Al-Atatra sandpits (A/HRC/12/48, paras. 1112-
1176), and that specific allegations of torture and ill-treatment remain under investigation 
by the Military Police.16 
</p>
<p>29. The Committee has discovered no information relating to four incidents referred to 
in the FFM report: incident AD/02 (paras. 1127-1142); incident AD/06 (para. 1107); the 
attack on the Al-Quds hospital (paras. 596-629); and the attack on the Al-Wafa hospital

<p>(paras. 630-652). Nor has the Committee uncovered updated information concerning the 
status of the criminal investigations into the death of Muhammed Hajji and the shooting of 
Shahd Hajji and Ola Masood Arafat (A/HRC/12/48, paras. 745-754); and the shooting of 
Ibrahim Juha (ibid., paras 755-763). Accordingly, the Committee remains unable to 
determine whether any investigation has been carried out in relation to those incidents.  
</p>
<p>30. The Committee also conducted an assessment of specific inquiries into the use of 
human shields that were not explicitly mentioned in the FFM report. The Committee recalls 
that the Government of Israel reported that the MAG had directly referred for criminal 
investigation all allegations that civilians were used as human shields or compelled to take 
part in military operations.17 In his April 2010 report on children and armed conflict, the 
Secretary-General noted that the MAG was investigating reports of seven Palestinian 
children used by Israeli soldiers as human shields in three separate incidents during the 
Gaza conflict (A/64/742-S/2010/181, para. 101). The outcome of the investigations into 
two of these incidents is unknown. The other investigation was opened in June 2009 on the 
instructions of the MAG following a complaint by Defence for Children International.18 
According to media reports, two soldiers forced a boy to search bags suspected of being 
booby trapped and were convicted of offenses including inappropriate behavior and 
overstepping authority.19 Both soldiers were demoted and received suspended sentences of 
three months each.20  
</p>
<p>31. It should be noted that while some media reports described the conviction as a credit 
to the IDF, a former IDF deputy chief of staff reportedly said that the soldiers&#8217; criminal 
records should be cleared and that such events should be probed inside the units and not in 
interrogation rooms.21 The boy&#8217;s mother apparently indicated her disappointment over the 
decision to suspend the prison terms and expressed concern at the message that such a 
lenient sentence would send to IDF soldiers.22 Reportedly, in the ruling, the judges 
condemned the actions of the soldiers, but they also gave weight to issues such as the 
contribution of the soldiers to Israel&#8217;s security and their personal circumstances, and 
concluded that the soldiers &#8220;did not seek to degrade or humiliate the boy&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>32. The Committee does not have sufficient information to comment definitively on this 
judgment, although it is hard to square the apparent finding that the soldiers &#8220;did not seek to 
degrade or humiliate the boy&#8221; with evidence that they intended to put him directly in 
harm&#8217;s way at grave risk to his life. The Committee is mindful of other judicial decisions, 
such as the case of the soldier who was sentenced to a prison term of seven and a half 
months for stealing a credit card during the operation in Gaza, where a harsher penalty was 
imposed for acts that did not entail danger to the life or physical integrity of a civilian, 
much less to a 9-year-old child.

<p><b> 2. West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>33. The FFM analyzed the general situation in the West Bank and pointed to a series of 
incidents that were not directly related to the military operations in Gaza but nonetheless 
required investigation by Israel (A/HRC/12/48, paras. 1381-1440). In its previous report, 
the Committee indicated that the record before it was silent as to whether or not Israel had 
conducted investigations into allegations of human rights violations in the West Bank, 
including in relation to the alleged use of force during demonstrations and violence by 
settlers at the time of the events in Gaza (A/HRC/15/50, para. 62). Recent information 
indicates that Israel has in fact investigated 14 such incidents, 11 of which were referred to 
in the FFM report.24 Of those 14 investigations, two criminal indictments have been filed, 
six investigations are ongoing, and six cases were closed without charges.25 
</p>
<p>34. The first indictment refers to the alleged killing of 10-year-old Ahmed Husam Yusef 
Musa in Ni&#8217;lin on 29 July 2008 by a member of the Israeli Border Police (A/HRC/12/48, 
para. 1388). A second criminal indictment was filed in relation to an incident in which three 
members of the al-Matariyeh family were allegedly shot and injured by an Israeli settler in 
Hebron in December 2008 (ibid., para. 1385). However, the indictment was withdrawn in 
light of a Supreme Court decision requiring that the Prosecutor disclose information 
classified for national security reasons. The Prosecutor reportedly decided to withdraw the 
case after the defendant&#8217;s attorney requested that the Court order that the information be 
revealed. 
</p>
<p>35. Concerning ongoing investigations, the Military Police and the Israeli Police are 
carrying out parallel criminal investigations into the killing of Basam Abu Rahma on 17 
April 2009 in Bi&#8217;lin26 during a peaceful demonstration against the Wall (see A/HRC/12/48, 
para. 1395). This incident was filmed and Mr. Rahma is reportedly seen standing on a small 
hill, clearly visible and not armed or otherwise posing a threat (ibid.). The Committee 
learned that the MAG had ordered a criminal investigation after representations from the 
family&#8217;s attorney that the issue would be raised with the Supreme Court and taking into 
account expert opinion based on viewing a film of the incident. An earlier decision not to 
launch a criminal investigation was apparently based on statements given by soldiers in the 
operational debriefing.27 According to media reports, the decision to open a criminal 
investigation was announced in July 2010, more than one year after the incident.28 
</p>
<p>36. A criminal investigation is also reportedly being conducted into the killing of 'Iz a-
Din Radwan Radwan al-Jamal on 13 February 2009 in Hebron. According to reports, the 
criminal investigation was opened following the finalization of a command investigation.29 
</p>
<p>37. Finally, an investigation by the military police was conducted into the alleged killing 
of Yasser Tmeizi by the IDF at Tarqumiyah checkpoint on 13 January 2009. The results of

<p>the investigation were apparently sent to the MAG in August 2009.30 Reports indicate that, 
after almost two years, the results of the investigation are still under review by the MAG. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other investigations 
</b></p>
<p>38. As the Committee indicated in its previous report (A/HRC/15/50, para. 42), the 
Government of Israel established a public commission &#8211; known as the Turkel Commission 
&#8211; to examine the maritime incident of 31 May 2010. The Commission &#8211; which includes two 
international observers &#8211; was mandated, inter alia, to examine the question whether the 
&#8220;mechanism for examining and investigating complaints and claims raised in relation to 
violations of the laws of armed conflict, as conducted in Israel generally, &#8230; conform with 
the obligations of the State of Israel under the rules of international law&#8221;.31  
</p>
<p>39. The Committee considers that the work of the Turkel Commission is directly 
relevant to its own mandate, because it is evidence that Israel does have a mechanism for 
carrying out inquiries into decisions and policies adopted by high-level officials. (The 
Committee focused exclusively on the process and methodology agreed upon by the Turkel 
Commission; it did not address &#8211; and does not endorse &#8211; the substance of the Commission&#8217;s 
analysis and conclusions with respect to the flotilla incident.) It notes that Commission 
members interviewed and actively questioned a number of high-level officials, including 
the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, the Chief of General Staff, the Chief Military 
Advocate, and members of Parliament, as well as representatives of human rights 
organizations. An analysis of the transcripts of the public hearings demonstrates that the 
Commission members &#8211; with active participation from the international observers &#8211; 
thoroughly examined the controversial legal and political issues presented for their 
consideration. The Turkel Commission issued part one of its report on 21 January 2011. 
Part two of the report, which will address the effectiveness of Israel&#8217;s mechanism for 
investigations, will be issued later in 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Assessment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Independence and impartiality 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Committee noted in its previous report that Israel&#8217;s military justice system 
provides for mechanisms to ensure its independence, in particular the fact that the MAG is 
not hierarchically subordinate to the Chief of General Staff and that his decisions are 
subject to review by the Attorney-General and by the Supreme Court (A/HRC/15/50, para. 
52). The Committee has not received any new evidence that challenges this finding. 
</p>
<p>41. The Committee further noted that notwithstanding the built-in structural guarantees 
to ensure the independence of the MAG, his dual responsibilities as legal advisor to the 
Chief of Staff and other military authorities, and his role as supervisor of criminal 
investigations within the military, raise concerns in the present context given allegations in 
the FFM report that those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw the operation in 
Gaza were complicit in international humanitarian and human rights law violations 
(A/HRC/12/48, para. 1895). It is notable that the MAG himself, in his testimony to the 
Turkel Commission, pointed out that the military investigations system he heads is not a 
viable mechanism to investigate and assess high-level policy decisions. When questioned 
by Commission members about his &#8220;dual hat&#8221; and whether his position at the apex of legal 
</p>

</i></p>

 31 Government Resolution of 14.6.2010, quoted in the <i>Report of the Public Commission to Examine the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Maritime Incident of 31 May 2010 (The Turkel Commission)</i>, part one, January 2011, p. 17. </p>


<p>advisory and prosecutorial power could present a conflict of interest under certain 
circumstances, he stated that &#8220;the mechanism is calibrated for the inspection of individual 
incidents, complaints of war crimes in individual incidents &#8230; This is not a mechanism for 
policy. True, it is not suitable for this&#8221;.32 Therefore, the Committee remains of the view that 
an independent public commission &#8211; and not the MAG office &#8211; is the appropriate 
mechanism for carrying out an independent and impartial analysis, as called for in the FFM 
report, into allegations that high-level decision-making related to the Gaza conflict violated 
international law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Promptness</b>33<b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Committee has previously expressed reservations as to whether Israel&#8217;s 
investigations into allegations of misconduct have been sufficiently prompt (A/HRC/15/50, 
para. 51). In particular, the Committee remains concerned about the fact that unnecessary 
delays in carrying out such investigations may have resulted in evidence being lost or 
compromised, or have led to the type of conflicting testimony that characterized the 
investigations into the killings of Majda and Raayya Hajaj (ibid.) and the inconclusive 
findings reported with respect to the tragic deaths of Souad and Amal Abd Rabbo and the 
grave wounding of Samar Abd Rabbo and their grandmother Souad (see A/HRC/12/48, 
paras. 770-779). 
</p>
<p>43. The Committee is fully aware of the difficulties involved in investigating alleged 
violations that occurred in a situation of combat, in particular when it comes to the 
collection of evidence, interviewing witnesses and victims, and the accurate establishment 
of the facts, often in the absence of sufficient forensic tools. Yet, while acknowledging the 
complexity and difficulty of the challenges presented to investigators in the wake of the 
numerous allegations of wrongdoing by IDF soldiers during the Gaza conflict, it is worth 
noting that out of 36 incidents related to Gaza referred to in the Committee&#8217;s previous 
report, more than one third remain unresolved or with an unclear status two years after the 
events took place. That situation raises serious concern as to whether the existing 
mechanisms are capable of insuring that investigations are conducted in a prompt manner. 
Presumably this is an issue that is under careful review by the Turkel Commission and will 
be addressed in part two of its report. 
</p>
<p>44. The promptness of an investigation is closely linked to the notion of effectiveness. 
An effective investigation is one in which all the relevant evidence is identified and 
collected, is analyzed, and leads to conclusions establishing the cause of the alleged 
violation and identifying those responsible. In that respect, the Committee is concerned 
about the fact that the duration of the ongoing investigations into the allegations contained 
in the FFM report &#8211; over two years since the end of the Gaza operation &#8211; may seriously 
impair their effectiveness and, therefore, the prospects of achieving accountability and 
justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Transparency 
</b></p>
<p>45. The issue of the transparency of Israel&#8217;s investigations is a concern that has been 
highlighted by a number of different sources and appears to be a matter of some dispute. 
Thus, in his testimony to the Turkel Commission, the MAG indicated that his office, as a 
</p>
<p>  
 32 Testimony of the Chief Military Advocate General, Avichai Mandelblit, to the Turkel Commission, 
</p>
<p>Session Number Four, 26 August 2010. 
 33 In its previous report the Committee noted that as a general rule an investigation should commence 
</p>
<p>and progress with reasonable expedition. Determining whether an investigation has met this standard 
of reasonableness depends on the specific circumstances of the case (A/HRC/15/50, para. 25). </p>


<p>matter of practice, regularly informs claimants and their attorneys about its decisions with 
respect to the outcome of an investigation. He emphasized that his office advises the 
complainants and their lawyers of the reasons why his office determines not to pursue a 
criminal investigation and makes available relevant evidence for their examination in case 
they wish to file a petition with the Supreme Court.34 
</p>
<p>46. The Committee notes, however, that consistent reports from NGOs, victims, and 
their legal representatives reflect that only on rare occasions do they actually receive 
information from the MAG concerning the status of investigations into their complaints. A 
number of organizations have informed the Committee that they often found out about the 
results of inquiries into cases they have filed on behalf of alleged victims either through the 
press or in the public reports issued by the Government of Israel. Indeed, the Committee 
received detailed, case-specific information concerning requests for information by 
different organizations &#8211; the great majority of which have gone unanswered. This situation 
raises serious questions concerning the effective implementation of the reported policy of 
the MAG to assure transparency in the investigation process.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Allegations not investigated 
</b></p>
<p>47. The information available to the Committee suggests that not all allegations of 
violations identified in the FFM report have been adequately investigated. These include 
allegations related to higher level decisions about the design and implementation of the 
Gaza operation, including those related to the nature, objectives and targets of the Israeli 
military in that conflict (see A/HRC/12/48, paras. 1880-1895). The Committee has no new 
information leading it to change its view that Israel does not appear to have conducted a 
general review of doctrine regarding military targets. However, it has been informed of 
media reports suggesting that if criminal charges are brought as a result of the investigation 
into the al-Samouni case, it is possible that there will be deliberations on the broader 
question of the rules of engagement that were applied during Operation Cast Lead.35 
</p>
<p>48. Nor has the Committee uncovered information concerning investigations into certain 
alleged human rights violations committed in Israel and the West Bank, including 
allegations of torture, discrimination, lack of access to effective remedies, unlawful 
detention, violations of the rights to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly, or 
alleged violations related to the removal of residency status from Palestinians.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The Palestinian side 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Investigations conducted 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Committee noted in its previous report that the Palestinian Authority established 
the Palestinian Independent Investigation Commission to implement the recommendations 
of the FFM report (A/HRC/15/50, para. 65). On 13 February 2011, the Commission made a 
written submission to the Committee, in which it explained the measures taken since 
September 2010 to follow up on its July 2010 report to the Secretary-General. In particular, 
the Commission referred to its efforts to establish contacts with the Government of Israel 
</p>

</p>
<p>Session Number Four, 26 August 2010. 
 35 Harel and Pfeffer, &#8220;IDF probes top officers&#8221; (note 10 above).  </p>


<p>and the de facto authorities in Gaza so as to have access to witnesses and victims and to 
inspect the sites of rocket attacks on Israeli territory. The Commission indicated that it had 
not received a positive response either from Israel or from the de facto authorities in Gaza 
and therefore was not in a position to provide any further update with respect to the rocket 
attacks on Israel launched from Gaza. 
</p>
<p>50. The Committee was advised that on 18 October 2010, the Council of Ministers of 
the Palestinian Authority established a Ministerial Committee to follow up on the 
recommendations of the Independent Investigation Commission. The Ministerial 
Committee was mandated to issue recommendations to the Council of Ministers for the 
implementation of the Commission report and submitted its report &#8211; a copy of which was 
made available to this Committee &#8211; to the Council of Ministers in February 2011. 
</p>
<p>51. The Ministerial Committee recommended a number of short-term strategies that are 
to be implemented within two months of the adoption of the report. In particular, it called 
on the General Prosecutor to investigate any allegation of torture or ill-treatment in 
detention centers;36 it specified that civilians should not be subject to detention by the 
military justice system, but that all civilian detainees should be transferred to the ordinary 
civilian justice system; it urged the General Prosecutor to prosecute any official who 
refuses to implement a court decision, and that any such official should be dismissed from 
his functions; and it recommended that the Prime Minister issue clear directives instructing 
all relevant officials that clearance by security services is not a legal requirement for 
employment in the civil service.  
</p>
<p>52. With respect to long-term strategies, the Ministerial Committee proposed six 
recommendations: (a) to establish a Constitutional Court; (b) to adopt an administrative 
courts act creating first and second instance administrative courts; (c) to amend the prisons 
act to allow systematic oversight and monitoring by the Ministry of Justice; (d) to enact the 
Palestinian criminal code; (e) to amend the Palestinian Code of Criminal Procedures to 
separate investigating functions from prosecution functions; and (f) to adopt legislation to 
regulate the functioning of the military justice system, criminal offenses, criminal 
procedure and other issues related to the jurisdictional scope of military justice.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Assessment 
</b></p>
<p>53. In its previous report, the Committee noted that the Independent Investigation 
Commission had undertaken independent and impartial investigations in a comprehensive 
manner (A/HRC/15/50, para. 70). The Committee has received no new evidence to 
challenge this finding. Rather, on the contrary, the Commission has persevered in 
attempting to investigate the rocket attacks on Israeli territory, as well as other violations 
allegedly committed in the Gaza Strip, but has not been provided with access to interview 
the victims or to inspect the scene. Such limitation seriously hampers the adequate 
fulfillment of its mandate.    
</p>
<p>54. The Committee finds that since the adoption of the Independent Investigation 
Commission report, the implementation of the Commission&#8217;s recommendations, in 
particular those related to the obligation to investigate and prosecute allegations of arbitrary 
detention, torture and ill-treatment, and extrajudicial killings,37 has been limited. The 
General Prosecutor documented one case in particular, in which five security officers were 
charged with the murder of an individual detained by the Palestinian security services. In 
</p>
<p>  
 36 The report further refers to decision 149 (2009) of the Ministry of Interior prohibiting the use of 
</p>
<p>torture or ill-treatment by security services. 
 37 See the report of the Secretary-General on the second follow-up to the report of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/64/890), annex II, paras. 464-465. </p>


<p>the judgment, the military court acquitted the defendants of all charges in view of the fact 
that it could not clearly identify the actual perpetrator, but it determined that, at a minimum, 
the death had resulted from negligence on the part of the security services and, therefore, 
ordered the payment of compensation to the family of the deceased. 
</p>
<p>55. Despite this example, the Committee has received no information with respect to the 
opening of criminal investigations or of prosecutions underway relating to incidents 
outlined in the FFM or in the Independent Investigation Commission report, since January 
</p><p>2010. For instance, the General Prosecutor provided a list of 326 criminal investigations 
carried out between 7 January 2010 and 7 March 2011. While this list reflects 
commendable efforts on the part of the Palestinian Authority to investigate criminal cases, 
these inquiries appear to be unrelated to the allegations in the FFM report. Accordingly, 
further efforts should be expended to systematically investigate allegations of extrajudicial 
killings, of torture and ill-treatment, of unlawful detention, and re-arrests, and of the lack of 
implementation of Court orders directing the release of unlawfully detained individuals. 
</p>
<p>56. Notwithstanding the problems listed above, the Committee underscores that the 
establishment of the Ministerial Committee is a very welcome development. The 
Ministerial Committee&#8217;s report lays down a road map of short- and long-term strategies that 
go squarely in the direction of implementing the recommendations of the Independent 
Investigation Commission. Indeed, some positive developments have already taken place. 
For instance, information provided by the Minister of Justice indicates that on 15 January 
2011 a decision was made by the General Prosecutor, the Military Prosecutor and 
Palestinian security services to transfer all cases of civilians being tried before military 
courts to domestic criminal courts for prosecution. This change in policy was confirmed by 
the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR). The ICHR represented 
to the Committee on 10 March 2011 that, since 15 January 2011, no new cases against 
civilians have been brought before military courts, but it noted that the transfer of existing 
cases before military courts to civilian courts has still not been fully implemented. 
</p>
<p>57. Moreover, the General Prosecutor has adopted new rules relating to the monitoring 
of places of detention by his office.38 
</p>
<p>58. To underscore the importance of these changes and ensure that they are 
implemented throughout the West Bank, the Ministerial Committee recommended that the 
Palestinian President and the Prime Minister should issue timely and clearly defined 
instructions to all security, judicial and executive services ordering the strict observance of 
the existing legal framework so that changes that have been accomplished at the policy 
level actually have consequences in practice. The Committee notes with concern that, 
according to the ICHR monthly reports, allegations of torture and ill-treatment remained at 
the same level in the West Bank throughout 2010 and the beginning of 2011. Therefore, 
much more needs to be done to effectively implement the necessary measures indicated 
above. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The de facto Gaza authorities 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Committee requested updated information from the de facto Gaza authorities 
with respect to measures they have taken in response to the FFM report since September 
</p><p>2010.  
</p>
<p>  
 38 The Committee was informed by the General Prosecutor that his office now conducts regular visits to 
</p>
<p>both civilian and military detention facilities to monitor the treatment of detainees and the conditions 
of detention.  </p>


<p>60. In their response, the de facto authorities informed the Committee that their officials 
did not have access to persons involved in the launching of rockets and mortars into Israel, 
nor to the sites and victims affected by the rockets. The de facto authorities also indicated 
that since 30 October 2008 all political prisoners have been released. In an annex, the de 
facto authorities provided a list of 32 names of political prisoners who have reportedly been 
liberated. The de facto authorities stated that all persons currently under detention are under 
criminal investigation or have been sentenced to prison terms. 
</p>
<p>61. Finally, the de facto authorities provided a list of seven cases related to 
investigations into allegations of torture, injuries or extrajudicial killings. According to the 
information, four out of those seven cases were discontinued at the request of the victim.39 
Of the remaining three cases, one investigation into ill-treatment is still ongoing and two 
prison sentences were imposed in relation to killings. The de facto authorities provided a 
detailed list of those cases, including each victim&#8217;s name, the name of the alleged 
perpetrator, the description of the charges, the date of commencement of the inquiry, the 
status of the investigation, and the description of the penalties imposed. 
</p>
<p>62. The Committee acknowledges the de facto authorities&#8217; efforts to provide specific 
information related to criminal investigations into alleged human rights violations 
committed by their security forces. The Committee is aware of the fact that it is not 
uncommon for such cases to be resolved to the satisfaction of the families through out-of-
court settlements. Nevertheless, the Committee remains concerned that no investigations 
have been carried out into the launching of rocket attacks against Israel. It considers that the 
de facto authorities should make genuine efforts to conduct criminal inquiries and to hold 
accountable those who have allegedly engaged in serious violations of international 
humanitarian law by firing these rockets. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Other issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p>63. After nine months of working with the question of the implementation of the FFM 
report by Israel and the Palestinian side, the Committee considers it opportune to discuss 
several issues of concern that it has encountered in the implementation of its mandate and 
that directly relate to the allegation of the FFM report that there is a &#8220;justice crisis&#8221; that 
warrants action (A/HRC/12/48, para. 1958; see more generally pp. 1874-1966). 
</p>
<p><b> A. The current context 
</b></p>
<p>64. First, it should be noted that the current situation in Israel and the West Bank and 
Gaza remains tense. The Committee was informed that during the period between 10 
December 2010 and 10 March 2011, 78 rockets and 96 mortars<b> </b>were launched against 
southern Israel, with the vast majority of these attacks taking place during the afternoon 
hours.40 While the present report was being prepared, a ship allegedly bound for the Gaza 
Strip transporting munitions was intercepted by Israel,41 and a family in the West Bank was 
</p>
<p>  
 39 Of those four cases, two referred to alleged ill-treatment and two to shooting incidents.

<p>brutally murdered while asleep.42 Palestinian civilians continue to be injured and killed by 
Israeli soldiers, and a 65-year-old Palestinian man was killed &#8220;by mistake&#8221; as he slept in his 
bed in Hebron in January.43 Meanwhile, Palestinian children are routinely arrested in the 
middle of the night and taken off to military detention.44 Settler violence against 
Palestinians and Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians continues in the West Bank. 
The harsh conditions imposed on Palestinians at checkpoints and border controls, often in 
humiliating circumstances, feeds the feeling of injustice among the civilian population.45 As 
recently reported by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in her report on the 
implementation of Human Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 covering the period 
from 4 February to 30 November 2010, the situation is of profound concern and serious 
violations occur &#8220;on a widespread and persistent basis&#8221; (A/HRC/16/71, para. 55). As 
stressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/254, there is a &#8220;need to ensure 
accountability for all violations of international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law in order to prevent impunity, ensure justice, deter further violations and promote 
peace&#8221;. The Committee believes that significant and sustained efforts from the parties 
concerned are required to achieve accountability and justice. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>65. Second, the Committee is keenly aware that human rights organizations play a vital 
role in any system of investigating and prosecuting allegations of violations of international 
law. The Government of Israel has acknowledged that the MAG himself considers the 
information provided by human rights defenders as an important part of his deliberations 
about incidents. It has further represented that the Military Police actively seek the help of 
human rights organizations and Israeli lawyers representing complainants in order to 
facilitate meetings between Israeli investigators and Gaza residents.46 Similarly, both the 
Independent Investigation Commission and the de facto Gaza authorities report receiving 
valuable information from human rights organizations. The Commission engaged in 
consultations with human rights and other civil society organizations and national figures in 
relation to its methods of work, identifying potential difficulties, and how to resolve them 
(A/64/890, annex II, p. 82, para. 64). The Committee itself has obtained invaluable 
information from NGOs in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Geneva, London and New York. 
</p>
<p>66. The FFM expressed concerns about allegations of hostile retaliatory actions directed 
at civil society organizations for criticism of the Israeli authorities and for exposing alleged 
violations of international law during the military operations (A/HRC/12/48, para. 1767) &#8211; 
concerns that appear to be increasingly valid. The Committee has heard a constant refrain 
from NGOs about the deteriorating climate for human rights defenders in Israel and that 
this has had a negative impact on their ability to pursue their work. Specifically, the 
Committee has been informed about an initiative in the Knesset to launch a parliamentary 
inquiry probing human rights organizations, notwithstanding the Attorney General&#8217;s

<p>warning that such an inquiry could violate fundamental human rights.47 Similarly, a bill to 
punish individuals who call for academic or economic boycotts against Israel was 
reportedly adopted in its first reading by the Knesset,48 and there are efforts underway as 
well to discourage organizations that seek to hold IDF soldiers accountable for war crimes 
in international courts.49 
</p>
<p>67. The FFM also reported allegations that the security services of the Palestinian 
Authority had interfered with the work of journalists (A/HRC/12/48, para. 1551). Further, 
the Committee has received information that the de facto authorities in Gaza, while 
generally tolerant of local human rights organizations,50 have recently stated that the ICHR 
is not legally qualified to work in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>68. Equally distressing are reports that victims who travel to Erez to meet with Israeli 
military investigators have been summoned for questioning about these contacts by the de 
facto authorities in Gaza. 
</p>
<p>69. Given this situation, the Committee wishes to remind all parties that the ability of 
human rights organizations to function freely and independently is crucial for the 
improvement of the domestic human rights situation in general, and for the effective 
functioning of accountability mechanisms in particular.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The victims&#8217; right to justice and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>70. Third, and most importantly, the Committee emphasizes that General Assembly 
resolution 64/254 called upon the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side to conduct 
investigations that are independent, credible and in conformity with international standards 
towards insuring accountability and justice. During its work, the Committee was struck by 
the testimony of victims on both sides that justice has not been done and that they lack 
confidence that it is ever likely to be done. For example, a Palestinian resident in Gaza told 
the Committee that investigations into Operation Cast Lead incidents &#8220;were superficial, not 
significant, and misleading to the international community. Despite our belief that the 
investigation was not serious we decided to appear and deliver testimony, out of a belief 
that we are civilians and innocent. But we also believed that in the end, we will end up with 
nothing. We were correct; the investigation carried out by Israel is just a game, nothing 
more.&#8221;51 
</p>
<p>71. One Israeli victim of rocket attacks expressed her frustration at the lack of justice 
and said, &#8220;I have no Court, no one to represent me, no one to sue. Is that real justice?&#8221;52 She 
also articulated her disappointment with the international community: &#8220;I was disappointed 
[by the FFM] and found myself feeling more humiliated than ever before in my life because 
it seemed to me there was no mention of Israeli victims who, like me, have suffered for 
more than eight years the rockets and mortars, it seemed to me that no one wanted to issue a

<p> 49 See for example information available at www.acri.org.il/en/?p=1639. 
 50 The Committee has also received information that the de facto authorities have taken measures 
</p>
<p>against a broad range of civil society organizations, allegedly for involvement in Fatah affiliated 
political activities or immoral conduct.

<p>strong condemnation of terror coming from Gaza. Since that time I have lost faith in the 
international committees, especially the United Nations, as it seems no one is asking if I 
have a right to live.&#8221;53 
</p>
<p>72. The Committee heard the respective parties&#8217; claims that their systems have 
established mechanisms to ensure accountability and justice. Yet, after listening to victims, 
witnesses and human rights organizations, it is clear that the needs of victims are not being 
adequately addressed. For example, while the Israeli system allows for Palestinian victims 
to file civil claims with the Supreme Court, the reality for Gaza residents is that, given 
existing restrictions preventing entry into Israel, their right to a remedy and reparation is 
limited in such a way as to render it virtually ineffective. A petition filed by a human rights 
organization points out that the existing two-year statute of limitations, and the number of 
obstacles to accessing Israel, effectively undermine any real prospect of obtaining justice.54 
</p>
<p>73. Similarly, victims on both sides continue to raise the question whether their right to 
obtain reparation will be adequately respected. This is not just a matter of law; this is, in the 
view of the Committee, a matter of the most basic principles of justice. When harm has 
been done, irrespective of the reasons and justifications for it, victims should be given the 
opportunity to be compensated for the damages suffered, whether physical, psychological, 
or patrimonial. The Committee notes the increasing practice of Member States carrying out 
military operations in different parts of the world to offer ex gratia payments when direct or 
indirect damage is caused to civilians. Such practice is commendable and should, in the 
near future, constitute the norm rather than the exception.55 
</p>
<p>74. But above all, listening to the testimony, the Committee apprehended that many 
people continue to feel insecure, they carry the burden of injuries and disabilities, and 
struggle to live in difficult conditions. The Committee heard testimonies from mothers on 
both sides who are raising children suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and who 
have to consider where they can run for shelter to protect their families.56 The Committee 
also is mindful of submissions it received about the destruction of the environmental 
infrastructure in Gaza and the need for materials to be allowed in to enable the civilian 
population to repair damage to wells and household water and sanitation systems.57 The 
Committee considers that, for as long as victims &#8211; in Israel and in Gaza &#8211; continue to lack 
confidence in the investigative processes, and continue to live in difficult and unsafe 
conditions, without hope of remedy, there will be no genuine accountability and no justice.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Committee, in the course of its work since the adoption of Human Rights 
Council resolution 13/9, has monitored and assessed the different proceedings 
undertaken by the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side on the basis of 
available public information, contributions from government authorities, NGOs and 
other actors, and accounts from victims and witnesses. It considers that the analysis 
presented in the present report completes and concludes its examination of the issues 
it was requested to address in resolution 13/9. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Israel 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Although the Committee was able to access official information detailing the 
progress of some investigations by the Israeli authorities since September 2010, it 
relied largely on media reports and other secondary sources to inform its 
deliberations. The Israeli authorities&#8217; refusal to allow the Committee access to Israel 
and the West Bank, and access to Gaza through Israel, significantly constrained the 
Committee&#8217;s ability to engage with key interlocutors. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>That said, the Committee finds that Israel has dedicated significant resources to 
investigate over 400 allegations of operational misconduct in Gaza reported by the 
United Nations Independent Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict and others. 
Given the scale of this undertaking, it is unsurprising that in 2011, much remains to 
be accomplished. The Committee is able to report that, to the best of its knowledge, 19 
investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law reported by the Fact-Finding Mission have been 
completed by the Israeli authorities with findings that no violations were committed. 
Two inquiries were discontinued for different reasons. Three investigations led to 
disciplinary action. Six investigations reportedly remain open, including one in which 
criminal charges have been brought against an Israeli soldier. The status of possible 
investigations into six additional incidents remains unclear.  
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Furthermore, Israel has launched 14 investigations into incidents related to 
alleged violations in the West Bank. Of those, two criminal indictments have been 
filed, six investigations are ongoing and six cases were closed without charges. The 
Committee received no information concerning other investigations of alleged 
violations committed in the West Bank, nor of investigations related to persons 
detained in Israel. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Committee reiterates the conclusion of its previous report that there is no 
indication that Israel has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed, 
planned, ordered and oversaw Operation Cast Lead.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>However, the Committee notes the work of the Turkel Commission and its 
probing of some decisions and policies adopted by high-level officials in Israel. The 
Committee concludes that a public commission &#8211; which includes international 
participants &#8211; constitutes one of the mechanisms that Israel could use to assess high-
level operational and legal decisions concerning the execution of the military 
operation in Gaza.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Concerns related to transparency and the participation of victims and witnesses 
in investigations reported by the Committee in its previous report continue to be </b></p>


<p><b>relevant. NGOs, victims and their legal representatives have difficulty accessing 
information about progress in investigations. They report that the majority of their 
requests for information go unanswered. The Committee is of the view that 
transparency and participation help build the confidence of victims and other 
interested parties in the investigation process, including fostering a sense that credible 
and genuine investigations are taking place. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Committee has strong reservations respecting the promptness of some 
investigations of individual incidents referred to by the Fact-Finding Mission. More 
than one third of the 36 incidents featured in the Fact-Finding Mission report (FFM 
report) are still unresolved or unclear. The status of investigations into incidents in 
Israel and the West Bank is also unclear. Presumably this serious issue with respect to 
the ability of the military justice system to investigate promptly allegations of 
wrongdoing during military operations is under careful review by the Turkel 
Commission. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Finally, the Committee is concerned about the fact that the duration of the 
ongoing investigations into the allegations contained in the FFM report &#8211; over two 
years since the end of the Gaza operation &#8211; could seriously impair their effectiveness 
and, therefore, the prospects of ultimately achieving accountability and justice.   
</b></p>
<p><b> C. The Palestinian side 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In September the Committee reported that the investigation carried out by the 
Independent Investigation Commission conformed to international standards and 
could be considered credible and genuine. More recently the Commission has sought 
to complete its mandate by investigating rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and 
other human rights violations in the Gaza Strip. The Committee was informed that 
the Commission had been unable to do so, as it had not received positive responses to 
requests for access from either Israel or the de facto authorities in Gaza. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Nonetheless, the work of the Independent Investigation Commission did 
provide a solid basis for proceeding against perpetrators and developing other 
measures. In October 2010, the Council of Ministers of the Palestinian Authority 
established a Ministerial Committee with a mandate to issue recommendations to the 
Council of Ministers about implementation of the Commission&#8217;s report. The report of 
the Ministerial Committee details strategies for significant institutional change over 
the next nine months, including the establishment of a Constitutional Court. The 
report also urges that the Prime Minister issue a directive that employment in the civil 
service not be dependent on security clearances, and that an ad hoc committee review 
past administrative decisions that led to dismissals. The Ministerial Committee 
further recommended that the General Prosecutor conduct criminal investigations 
into allegations of extrajudicial killings in Gaza, and of incidents in which officials 
allegedly refuse to implement court decisions. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Committee was also informed that a decision has been taken to transfer 
cases from military to civilian courts and that the office of the General Prosecutor 
now conducts regular monitoring visits to military and civilian detention facilities. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>These proposals and changes represent important developments. Nonetheless, 
the Committee is concerned that criminal accountability mechanisms have not yet 
been duly activated in relation to many of the allegations of serious violations in the 
FFM report. </b></p>


<p><b> 2. The de facto Gaza authorities 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In September 2010, the Committee stated it had been unable to substantiate 
reports that the de facto Gaza authorities had released all political prisoners or 
conducted criminal prosecutions, in response to the FFM report.   
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Committee acknowledges that the de facto authorities have now made 
efforts to provide specific information concerning criminal investigations into alleged 
human rights violations committed by their security forces. The Committee is aware 
of the fact that it is not uncommon for such cases to be resolved to the satisfaction of 
the families through out-of-court settlements.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Nevertheless, the Committee remains extremely concerned by the fact that the 
de facto authorities have not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket 
and mortar attacks against Israel. It considers that the de facto authorities should 
make serious efforts to conduct criminal inquiries into all the allegations of grave 
violations of international law implicated by these attacks. </b></p>
