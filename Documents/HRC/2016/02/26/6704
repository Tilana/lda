</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,

</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> commitments taken by the international community to fully implement the 
Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that they are likely to persist and even increase dramatically in some regions of the world unless 
urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the valuable work and commitment of Mr. Jean Ziegler during his tenure 
as the first mandate holder to achieving the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food for a 
period of three years: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote the full realization of the right to food and the adoption of measures at 
the national, regional and international levels for the realization of the right of everyone to 
adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully 
to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To examine ways and means of overcoming existing and emerging obstacles to the 
realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To continue mainstreaming a gender perspective and taking into account an age 
dimension in the fulfilment of the mandate, considering that women and children are 
disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To submit proposals that could help the realization of Millennium Development Goal 
No. 1 to halve by the year 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as to 
realize the right to food, in particular, taking into account the role of international assistance and 
cooperation in reinforcing national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To present recommendations on possible steps with a view to achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions 
for everyone to be free from hunger and as soon as possible enjoy fully the right to food, taking 
into account lessons learnt in the implementation of national plans to combat hunger; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To work in close cooperation with all States, intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as 
well as with other relevant actors representing the broadest possible range of interests and 
experiences, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different 
fields; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To continue participating in and contributing to relevant international conferences 
and events with the aim of promoting the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
his/her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him/her and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their 
countries, to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all 
necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur ending the fulfilment of his mandate to submit to the 
Council in 2008 a comprehensive final report on his findings, conclusions and recommendations, 
after more than six years as mandate holder on the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of 
the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the 
General Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 
November 2004 represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, 
contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the 
attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the 
Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the present 
resolution to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and to the Council in 2008, in 
accordance with its annual programme of work; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, 
treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as well as the 
private sector, to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his/her 
</p>
<p>mandate, inter alia through the submission of comments and suggestions on ways and means of 
realizing the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda item.
