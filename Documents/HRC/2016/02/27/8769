<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its seventh session from 8 to 19 February 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Iraq was held at the 13th meeting, on 16 February 2010. The 
delegation of Iraq was headed by the Minister for Human Rights, H.E. Mrs. Wijdan M. 
Salim. At its 17th meeting, held on 19 February 2010, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Iraq. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Iraq: Bosnia and Herzegovina, India and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Iraq: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRQ/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRQ/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRQ/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Iraq through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation emphasized the importance of the universal periodic review. It noted 
that Iraq had experienced difficult circumstances and that the Iraqi people had faced gross 
violations owing to the policies of successive Governments, wars, economic sanctions for 
more than 10 years and fierce terrorist attacks that had claimed the lives of thousands of 
individuals and affected infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the regime change in the spring of 2003 and the beginning of the 
establishment of a democratic Government, institutions had been established to address 
human rights issues, such as the Ministry of Human Rights, which had sought to achieve 
ambitious goals and to overcome the legacy of human rights violations. On the normative 
front, Iraq had proceeded to review national legislation, assess its compliance with human 
rights principles and accede to core international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>7. The Ministry of Human Rights has attached special importance to spreading a 
culture of human rights through the establishment of institutions, the provision of support to 
civil society, the inclusion of human rights concepts in educational curriculums and human 
rights courses in universities, and the adoption of a medium-term plan to disseminate a 
culture of human rights.   </p>


<p>8. The Government of National Unity formed after the 2005 democratic elections has 
placed the task of protecting human rights at the core of its programme. Terrorist groups 
have sought to undermine the rule of law by instilling chaos, creating a feeling of 
insecurity, destroying infrastructure and targeting scientists. One such group recently 
threatened to disrupt the forthcoming electoral process. 
</p>
<p>9. The national report is the outcome of the work of a committee composed of a 
number of ministries that coordinated with other governmental, parliamentarian, judicial 
and non-governmental institutions. The committee was open to consultations and 
networking with civil society organizations and received technical assistance from the 
United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the United Nations Office for 
Project Services (UNOPS). Since the submission of the report, a number of developments 
have taken place, including the adoption of a new electoral law with new guarantees for the 
representation of minorities and the adoption of the open list. Moreover, law on civil 
society organizations was adopted that regulates the work of such organizations and 
supports their role in society. An independent high commission for human rights is in the 
process of being put in place. 
</p>
<p>10. Responding to advance questions, the delegation noted that the Government 
understood the need to review a large number of laws with a view to harmonizing them 
with international human rights standards. Iraq has finalized the procedures for acceding to 
two conventions and has begun to study the possibility of becoming party to additional 
instruments. The Government has drafted new laws on combating the trafficking in 
persons; fighting against terrorism, money-laundering and the financing of terrorism; 
freedom of opinion, assembly and peaceful demonstration; and the protection of journalists.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stressed that, because of the exceptional circumstances in Iraq and 
the prevalence of terrorist crimes targeting the right to life, the death penalty had been 
maintained as a means of deterrence and to provide justice to the families of victims. The 
number of cases in which the death sentence is pronounced has been reduced, and its 
application is limited to the most serious crimes, including genocide, crimes against 
humanity and crimes of terrorism. All legal guarantees are provided to the accused in all 
stages of prosecution and until the sentence is carried out, and efforts are being made to 
reduce the number of executions to a minimum. 
</p>
<p>12. Torture and ill treatment are criminalized and prohibited in the Constitution and law, 
and officials accused of such acts are referred to the courts. The Ministry of Human Rights 
monitors allegations of torture in places of detention. Cases of torture do not represent a 
systematic policy, but rather occur because of lack of experience on the part of 
investigators, and constitute individual cases. The judiciary has attached importance to the 
protection and implementation of legal guarantees at all stages, and confessions obtained 
under torture are not taken into account. Iraq has finalized the national process of acceding 
to the Convention against Torture (CAT). 
</p>
<p>13. There are public annual reports on conditions in prisons and detention centres, which 
contain detailed information about the measures taken by the judiciary and executive 
powers. There is also an annual report containing information about the victims of terrorism 
and violence and about policies to combat terrorism and reduce violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>14. Terrorist groups have targeted minority groups, including through attacks on places 
of worship, killings and kidnappings. Efforts to protect minorities include protecting and 
reconstructing places of worship; ensuring the return of, protection for and financial 
assistance to displaced minorities; compensating victims; and coordinating directly with the 
heads of various sects in order to fulfil their needs. 
</p>
<p>15. In January, the Government launched a national strategy for the alleviation of 
poverty, in cooperation with the World Bank. The objectives of the strategy were </p>


<p>incorporated into the five-year development plan and are aimed at reducing poverty by 30 
per cent by ensuring better incomes for the poor and improving their situation in terms of 
health care, education, housing and social protection, and by reducing the disparities 
between man and women. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the interactive dialogue, 57 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations thanked the Government for its comprehensive national report, prepared 
through a large-scale process of consultation; for its comprehensive presentation; and for its 
responses to advance questions, which had allowed for an assessment of Iraq&#8217;s human 
rights promotion and protection efforts. Recommendations made during the interactive 
dialogue are found in chapter II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>17. Saudi Arabia noted the efforts to promote and implement human rights. Despite the 
challenges, the Government, through established legal mechanisms, was seeking to protect 
human rights, to enhance the role of civil society in rebuilding the country, to improve 
security and to provide basic living conditions for all. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>18. Jordan noted that, despite the difficulties it faced, Iraq had made genuine efforts to 
protect human rights. It hoped that the upcoming elections would be successful and 
contribute to reconciliation. It encouraged Iraq to strengthen laws on human rights. Jordan 
made recommendations.     
</p>
<p>19. Italy appreciated Iraqi&#8217;s commitment to protecting all religious communities. 
Ensuring their effective safety, freedom of worship and equal opportunities would enable 
them to better contribute to stability and to social and economic progress. It noted with 
concern that Iraq had resumed capital executions in May 2009. Italy made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>20. Algeria inquired about issues raised recently in the media, particularly the role of the 
justice and accountability commission and the upcoming elections. It asked about human 
rights education in schools and universities, as well as about prison conditions and human 
rights violations committed by foreign private security companies. Algeria made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>21. Brazil recognized the Government&#8217;s achievements, accomplished despite existing 
challenges. It highlighted the constitutional provisions on human rights, the establishment 
of a national institution and the participation of women in the Council of Representatives. It 
noted that full enjoyment of human rights was incompatible with war and that the situation 
of Iraq spoke for itself. Lack of infrastructure had impaired the enjoyment of rights. Brazil 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>22. The United Arab Emirates expressed appreciation for the spreading of a culture of 
human rights. It highlighted the establishment of the Ministry of Human Rights, the 
national human rights institute and, as an independent institution, the High Council for 
Human Rights. It commended Iraq&#8217;s efforts to cooperate with human rights mechanisms 
and UNAMI. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>23. Kuwait noted the efforts to enhance human rights and eliminate the vestiges of 
human rights violations suffered in the past. It commended the initiatives to spread a culture 
of human rights and the inclusion of human rights standards in the judicial system. Kuwait 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>24. The Sudan welcomed the international covenant adopted by Iraq with a view to 
establishing a democratic Government. It commended the Government&#8217;s interest </p>


<p>concerning the role of women and the family, as well as the increase in school enrolment 
and the decrease in child mortality. The Sudan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25. The United States of America hoped that the new Government would empower the 
Human Rights Commission. It commended efforts to address poor prison conditions and 
investigate allegations of detainee abuse. It expressed concern about the protection of 
minorities, women and LGBT. Continued attacks on religious sites and other sectarian 
violence were hampering the ability to practice religion freely. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Norway expressed appreciation for the establishment of the Ministry of Human 
Rights, the active participation of civil society and the establishment of quotas for the 
eligibility of women in elections. However, Norway remained concerned about the working 
conditions and the vulnerable situation of human rights defenders and journalists, and the 
practice of capital punishment, in addition to the issue of mitigating excuse regarding 
&#8220;honour crimes&#8221;. Norway made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>27. Belgium noted the positive steps taken by the Government, in particular regarding 
elections and the establishment of a Commission on Human Rights. It regretted the 
reinstatement of the death penalty and inquired about the notorious gap between official 
and civil society figures concerning the number of executions. It expressed concern about 
the situation of minorities. Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Mexico recognized efforts to set up an institutional human rights framework. It 
recalled that human rights protection was an obligation of the State and that, under the 
current circumstances, respect for international standards was particularly important. It 
inquired about the Government&#8217;s intention regarding the requests for visits made by some 
special procedures. Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>29. Australia commended recent achievements in the face of reduced violence and Iraq&#8217;s 
commitment to democratic elections. It remained concerned about the persecution of 
religious minorities and other vulnerable groups, including homosexuals; continued 
violence against women; the treatment of detainees; and the application of the death 
penalty. It welcomed assurances concerning the human rights situation at Camp Ashraf. 
Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. New Zealand welcomed the reduction in maternal mortality. It asked for an update 
on the process of ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It was 
concerned that the Supreme National Commission for Accountability had disbarred 
candidates for the 2010 elections without justification. It was troubled by &#8220;honour&#8221; killings 
and regretted that, legally, a motive of &#8220;honour&#8221; could be a mitigating factor. It noted with 
concern the execution of prisoners. Some visits by special procedures remain outstanding. 
It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>31. Tunisia noted the constitutional principles aimed at ensuring equality, non-
discrimination, the independence of the judiciary and the enjoyment of civil and political 
rights. It referred to the care taken in establishing strategies for promoting women&#8217;s rights 
and the rights of the disabled, despite difficult circumstances in Iraq. It noted the pioneering 
experience in establishing a culture of human rights among children in schools. Tunisia 
made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>32. Canada recognized Iraq&#8217;s continuing efforts to address human rights violations and 
strengthen respect for the rule of law, but expressed concern that women had not been 
afforded adequate protection against violence and at the escalation in attacks targeting 
homosexuals. It also noted reports concerning serious violations of the rights of detainees 
and the resumption of the use of capital punishment. Canada made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>33. Germany noted reports that &#8220;honour crimes&#8221; against women continued to be 
frequent and that laws against domestic violence were still lacking. It asked how the </p>


<p>Government was improving the situation of women and girls with regard to violence. 
Germany stated that attacks on journalists and religious pressure were placing limitations 
on freedom of opinion and expression. It asked about measures to ensure the stability 
necessary for functioning media. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Hungary inquired about measures taken to eliminate child labour and to guarantee 
the full enjoyment of freedom of religion, in particular the fact that the Constitution 
established that freedom of religion could be restricted if in conflict with Islamic law.  It 
also requested information about measures to improve the level of education and to 
guarantee equal access to proper education.  Hungary made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>35. Denmark welcomed Iraq&#8217;s reforms. It was troubled by the short time between 
sentencing and executions, with limited access to judicial recourse. It was concerned that 
the number of Iraqis belonging to minorities appeared to be decreasing and that such groups 
remained exposed to violent attacks. The members of some groups had been deemed 
&#8220;heretics&#8221; by the clergy, thus legitimizing the killing of such individuals. Such practices 
should be actively countered. Denmark made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Bahrain noted that, despite the difficulties resulting from the wars, the sanctions and 
the lack of security over the previous three decades, Iraq attached importance to promoting 
human rights as set out in its laws. It noted the improvement in the enjoyment by women of 
their rights and in their participation in public life. It commended the establishment of 
human rights units in ministries and the spreading of a culture of human rights.  
</p>
<p>37. The Republic of Korea highlighted the fact that peace, security, development and 
human rights were mutually reinforcing. It welcomed the legal framework for human rights 
put in place, but remained concerned about continuing reports of human rights violations, 
including arrest, detention, torture and ill treatment. It also stated that corruption could 
undermine trust in the rule of law. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>38. France expressed understanding with regard to the challenges faced by Iraq. It noted 
that the number of executions had significantly increased in recent years. France noted that 
many people had been killed on the basis of their sexual orientation and that the Iraqi Penal 
Code still criminalised homosexuality. France made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>39. Turkey welcomed the International Covenant for Iraq, aimed at providing stronger 
legal and institutional protection, particularly for vulnerable groups such as minorities, 
internally displaced persons, women and children. Turkey believed that democratic 
elections would provide an opportunity to establish a representative parliament and noted 
that attempts to exclude certain groups from the elections had the potential to create 
instability. It asked for further information about the ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>40. Pakistan noted the Government&#8217;s efforts to strengthen the institutional and legal 
framework to protect human rights. It also highlighted the fact that Iraq was party to most 
core international human rights instruments. It requested further details about the 
International Covenant with Iraq that commits domestication of international human rights, 
as well as the capacity-building of concerned officials and agencies.  Pakistan made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Malaysia fully appreciated the security situation, the challenges in implementing the 
rule of law and resource constraints. It was encouraged by the Government&#8217;s determination 
to improve the human rights situation and welcomed the close cooperation with human 
rights bodies. Malaysia was encouraged by efforts to establish a comprehensive plan for 
security and economic, political and social welfare. Malaysia made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>42. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the 
improvements in women&#8217;s rights, detention conditions and minority rights, and was </p>


<p>encouraged by the development of a five-year plan for protecting human rights. It was 
pleased with the establishment of an independent human rights commission. It remained 
concerned about the fact that people still waited years in detention before trial, often in 
overcrowded prisons, and about allegations of torture. It was also concerned that Iraq 
maintained the death penalty and that the number of executions had increased in the last 2 
years. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. Lebanon recognized Iraq&#8217;s efforts to achieve national unity, provide security for its 
citizens and build the human rights infrastructure, despite the enormous challenges faced by 
the country. It noted the programmes aimed at repatriation for Iraqis abroad and internally 
displaced persons, as well as programmes to ensure that all Iraqis enjoyed social and 
economic rights, by fighting poverty and extending social security. Lebanon made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. Slovenia noted that the Optional Protocols to ICCPR, CEDAW and CAT and the 
Refugees Convention had yet to be ratified. It highlighted the establishment of human 
rights offices in ministries. It noted that the Constitution still contained discriminatory 
wording towards women, and that armed groups persecuted minorities with impunity. Non-
Muslims remained under serious threat, being subject to forced conversion, kidnapping and 
torture. It asked what measures were envisaged to tackle that situation. It noted that 
numerous death sentences were being carried out. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Egypt noted the interest in promoting respect for human rights, despite serious 
difficulties. The activities of terrorist groups and instability had caused and were still 
causing suffering. Egypt paid tribute to the human rights committees established within 
ministries, the spreading of a culture of human rights and training, and the establishment of 
the Commission for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>46. The delegation stated that there had been many developments concerning the civil 
and political rights of women, including with regard to the number of women in Parliament 
and in decision-making positions and women&#8217;s participation in civil society. The 
Government was implementing a programme to combat domestic violence, and an 
agreement had been reached with the United Nations to organize a number of seminars to 
empower women and improve the enjoyment of their human rights. The Ministry of Human 
Rights held weekly seminars, most of which addressed the problems faced by women. 
There was an awareness-raising campaign on CEDAW. The report to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women was nearly complete. 
</p>
<p>47. The Ministry was working towards the abolition of article 128 of the Penal Code, on 
mitigating factors for &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;. With regard to combating the trafficking in persons, 
a multisectoral committee that assessed the situation of victims had been established, and a 
bill aimed at addressing that problem was being considered by the Council of Ministers. A 
number of training courses had been conducted to raise the awareness of children and 
young people about trafficking. The Iraqi law and the proposed law imposed heavy 
penalties for the perpetrators of such crimes. 
</p>
<p>48. Laws in the Kurdistan region did not discriminate between men and women, and 
that policies ensure equality, and abolish any discriminatory provisions, in particular 
regarding polygamy. Laws had been amended to combat violence against women, including 
the abolishment of the article on mitigating factors in &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;. The government of 
Kurdistan had adopted policies to combat violence against women, and institutional 
mechanisms had been established to that end. Anyone who had incited women to commit 
suicide was prosecuted by the courts. The crime of female genital mutilation was dealt with 
under the Penal Code until the law on domestic violence had been issued.   
</p>
<p>49. Judicial and other authorities had been empowered to address the issue of torture, 
and visits to detention centres had been carried out by judicial, governmental and non-</p>


<p>governmental institutions and ICRC. The Government, in cooperation with UNOPS, had 
supported three rehabilitation centres for victims of torture, and the law enabled victims to 
seek financial compensation. With support from the United Nations and the European 
Union, the justice network for prisoners had been created and was the first independent 
network of civil society organizations aimed at strengthening the independent monitoring of 
the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>50. Austria welcomed the ratification of the two Optional Protocols to CRC and recalled 
the overdue reports under CRC and CEDAW. Children and women had been particularly 
affected by the general situation and, particularly, by &#8220;honour crimes&#8221;. It expressed concern 
at the indications that courts were failing to meet minimum fair-trial standards. Austria 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Netherlands commended Iraq&#8217;s ratifications of ICCPR, ICERD and CEDAW. It 
expressed serious concern about judgements imposing the death penalty, including for 
ordinary crimes. It noted reports about instances of due process not being observed, the 
possible use of torture and the existence of unofficial detention centres. It noted that 
&#8220;honour killings&#8221; still occurred. It noted indications by UNAMI that a number of 
homosexuals had been assassinated. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Kazakhstan encouraged Iraq to continue to strengthen peace and promote democracy 
and national unity. Kazakhstan welcomed the establishment of a Ministry of Human Rights, 
cited the high level of women&#8217;s participation and representation in elected positions and 
was pleased to note Iraq&#8217;s steps to promote social, economic and cultural rights. 
Kazakhstan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>53. Japan hoped that the High Commission for Human Rights would begin to take 
effective action. It expected additional mechanisms for the return of internally displaced 
persons and refugees. It stated that budget constraints and a lack of personnel had prevented 
the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs from functioning. It welcomed efforts to improve the 
situation of detention centres. Japan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. Poland expressed concern with regard to the rights of religious minorities. UNAMI 
had received reports that Christians were being threatened, attacked and, in some cases, 
murdered by armed groups. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief noted 
that indicating one&#8217;s religious affiliation on official documents entailed a serious risk of 
abuse or discrimination. Poland asked about steps aimed at combating intolerance and acts 
of violence motivated by intolerance. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted that Iraq was party to most human rights and 
ILO conventions. It noted that during the past century, the school system had been among 
the best. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56. Switzerland acknowledged the security constraints faced and the difficulties 
encountered in normalizing the security institutions and the judicial system. It highlighted 
improvements, in particular in the area of federalism. It noted the increase in the use of the 
death penalty and in the number of executions. There is a need to carry out investigations 
and punish those responsible for attacks against minorities, women, human rights defenders 
and journalists. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Bosnia and Herzegovina inquired about civil society&#8217;s role in the preparation of the 
national report. It expressed concern at the fact that judges and lawyers were being 
threatened for having practised their profession. It noted that journalists, labour leaders and 
human rights defenders were exposed to serious threats, and asked about steps to prevent 
such violations. It noted that challenges had to be fought under extreme insecurity. Bosnia 
and Herzegovina made recommendations.  </p>


<p>58. Armenia felt encouraged by the Government&#8217;s achievements and recognized that 
securing the right to life was a precondition for further progress.  It supported the efforts to 
protect vulnerable groups from the violence, in particular confessional groups of Christians, 
Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans and Shabaks. It recalled the generosity of the Iraqi people, who 
had accommodated victims of conflicts during the past century. Armenia made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>59. Nigeria acknowledged the efforts to guarantee economic, social and cultural rights. 
Nigeria welcomed the improvements in school enrolment levels, the narrowing of the 
gender gap, the reduction in the infant and maternal mortality rates and in the area of 
women&#8217;s rights. Nigeria noted that Iraq faced enormous challenges in achieving the full 
promotion and protection of all human rights. Nigeria made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>60. China noted had Iraq had acceded to many international instruments and that the 
inclusion of human rights standards in the Constitution was a precondition for restoring the 
rule of law. It highlighted the establishment of the Ministry of Human Rights and praised 
the increased school enrolment and reduced gender disparities. It noted the collapse of the 
security system and the activities of terrorist groups. It hoped that Government would 
maintain social order so as to guarantee the right to life and development. China noted that 
the international community should continue to provide assistance.  
</p>
<p>61. Uruguay highlighted the ratification of the two Optional Protocols to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and hoped that the initial relevant reports would be submitted on 
time. It welcomed the establishment of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, but regretted the 
fact that violence against women persisted. Uruguay made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>62. Morocco expressed satisfaction at Iraq&#8217;s commitment to achieving stability, 
prosperity and the promotion of human rights within the context of its territorial integrity. 
The normative framework was noted, and human rights education was cited as an 
achievement in the national report. Morocco inquired about the mechanisms for providing 
compensation to victims of human rights violations. Morocco made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>63. Slovakia acknowledged the independence of the judiciary enshrined in the 
Constitution, while noting that courts still did not meet fair-trial standards. Accountability 
was a source of concern due to interference, a lack of institutional capacity and fears of 
retaliation. Judicial staff were subject to threats, and witnesses were not provided the 
necessary protection. Slovakia expressed concern at the reinstatement of the death penalty 
and noted that the range of punishable offences was quite broad. It condemned the 
continued use of minors by non-State militants. Slovakia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>64. Spain congratulated the Government on the ratification of the two Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>65. The Philippines commended the Government for establishing the Ministry of 
Human Rights, ratifying a number of core treaties and taking measures to improve the 
participation of women in political and economic life. Philippines noted progress in 
consolidating democratic governance, strengthening the rule of law and delivering basic 
services. However, the security challenge was having detrimental effects. Philippines made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>66. Sweden regretted the reinstatement of the death penalty. It noted the fact that more 
than 100 persons had been executed since May 2009. There were reports that trials had not 
met international standards and confessions were extracted through torture. Sweden 
expressed concern about violence against human rights defenders, journalists and trade 
unionists. Killings and disappearances had been reported. During 2009, the killing or brutal 
torture of homosexual men had become widespread, with accusations of involvement by 
security forces. Sweden made recommendations.  </p>


<p>67. Oman noted that promoting and protecting human rights was accorded priority 
through guarantees in the Constitution, in law and in practice. It noted the ratification of 
most conventions and the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>68. Ukraine commended the efforts to establish the national human rights infrastructure. 
Despite the decline in violence, it noted the weak rule of law and violations against women
