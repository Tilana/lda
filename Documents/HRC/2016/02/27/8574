<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur undertook an official visit to the United States of America 
between 12 and 27 October 2010. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with stakeholders 
in New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, New Orleans 
and Atlanta. She thanks the Government of the United States of America for its 
collaboration in organizing meetings with relevant government officials, and for its 
cooperation before, during and after the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. In Washington D.C., the Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the 
Department of State, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Department of 
Education, the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, the National Centre 
for Missing and Exploited Children and with a staff member of a Senator.  
</p>
<p>3. Due to the large number of stakeholders at the federal and state levels, for a list of 
divisions present at these meetings and those at the state level, please see annex I of this 
report.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also met with members of civil society in each of the cities 
visited, and visited programmes and care centres for children, including a child advocacy 
centre in New York City. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the opportunity to have 
met and exchanged views with children currently in care centers and NGO programmes. 
</p>
<p>5. In her report to the ninth session of the Human Rights Council in September 2008, 
the Special Rapporteur identified the objectives of her mandate.1 With those in mind, the 
objective of the visit was to explore the incidence of sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography in the United States of America, and to examine initiatives and measures 
undertaken by the Government and civil society to combat and prevent these phenomena, 
including by examining root causes and risk factors.  
</p>
<p>6. Throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur solicited the views of all stakeholders 
regarding the situation of the rights of the child in the country, on measures which have 
yielded some success, as well as on those which needed to be strengthened, with a view to 
making targeted conclusions and recommendations to be followed up effectively by all 
stakeholders concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>7. Prostitution, pornography and trafficking in persons for sexual purposes are not new 
phenomena in the United States of America. At the turn of the 20th century, for example, 
children as young as 9 years of age populated the brothels of large American cities2. The 
majority of the children found in these brothels were girls, while boys were also among the 
population of prostituted youth. The numbers of American children in sexual servitude 
were sufficiently large as to stimulate the beginnings of the American child welfare 
movement, which contributed to: 1) raising the legal age for sexual consent for girls from

<p>10 to 16 years; 2) passage of the Mann Act which made &#8220;white slavery&#8221; illegal; 3) the 
establishment of orphanages for homeless youth; 4) the creation of adoption and foster care 
systems; 5) the establishment of child protective services for children living in their own 
homes or in foster care; 6) the establishment within the federal government of the 
Children&#8217;s Bureau; and 7) the development of &#8220;orphan trains&#8221; that relocated tens of 
thousand of homeless children from street life to farms in the country&#8217;s mid- and far-west. 
Today, while far more is known and understood about the causes and consequences of 
commercial sexual exploitation of children, a substantial number of children continue to fall 
victim to these practices each year.3  
</p>
<p>8. In 2000, with the signature of the United Nations Convention on Transnational 
Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the Convention (&#8220;Palermo Protocol&#8221;), the 
United States of America enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA). The 
United States of America also participated in the Second and Third World Congresses on 
the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents in Yokohama in 2001 
and in Rio de Janeiro in 2008, respectively. . Since the enactment of the TVPA, efforts to 
combat trafficking in persons have focused primarily on the international trafficking in 
persons, including the trafficking of foreign citizens into the United States.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>9. The United States of America is party to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The United States of America ratified the two 
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict, and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography in 2002.  With respect to the latter, the United States of America made 
reservations to articles 2(a) and 2(c), so as to modify the definitions of the terms &#8220;sale of 
children&#8221; and &#8220;child pornography&#8221; respectively.  However, the United States of America 
has not yet ratified some key instruments, such as the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (&#8220;CRC&#8221;), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.   
</p>
<p>10. The United States of America is party to the ILO Convention No. 182 concerning 
the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour.   
</p>
<p>11. At the regional level, the United States of America is a Member State of the 
Organization of American States and adopted the American Declaration of the Rights and 
Duties of Man.  It is also a signatory to the American Convention on Human Rights.

<p><b> III. Situation analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>12. Given the nature of the phenomena of sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, the true scope of these practices in the United States of America is difficult to 
measure. According to information provided in the National Strategy for Child 
Exploitation, Prevention and Interdiction, the threat to a child in the United States of 
becoming a victim of child exploitation is a very serious one.4 Stakeholders agreed that 
commercial sexual exploitation is a highly profitable industry, coupled with a low risk of 
conviction for abusers, and there is a pool of vulnerable children at risk of being used in 
such practices.  
</p>
<p>13. According to various stakeholders the Special Rapporteur met with, in the United 
States of America, the phenomenon of child prostitution mostly affects: runaway and 
homeless youth (either from home or from foster care) who trade sex as a means of 
survival; children who have been sexually, physically and emotionally abused; and children 
who are controlled by adults and/or trafficking networks looking to make a profit. Poverty 
is often cited as an explanation for the involvement of children in prostitution. However, 
according to some studies, many children recruited into prostitution in the United States 
appear to come from working or middle class families and engage in prostitution as 
methods of supporting themselves while living on the streets.5  
</p>
<p>14. Virtually all interlocutors the Special Rapporteur met with were of the view that the 
scope of domestic child prostitution is unknown. Law enforcement officers in the different 
States visited stated that the problem is either growing or has been more or less steady over 
the past few years, but could not provide official disaggregated data regarding the sex, 
profile and age of the child victims. Data on the number of children identified, or 
investigations and convictions undertaken are available from different agencies. For 
instance, Los Angeles police processes about 100 cases of child prostitution per year, 
mostly girls, while Las Vegas Police identifies about 150-200 minors per year. However a 
centralized and standardized data collection system, across agencies, is still lacking. All 
states reportedly are seeing more cases of domestic trafficking.  
</p>
<p>15. In 2005, the TVPA was reauthorized, and it reflects the following findings of 
Congress: (a) trafficking in persons also occurs within the borders of a country, including 
the United States; (b) As many as 300,000 children in the United States are at risk for 
commercial sexual exploitation, including trafficking, at any given time; (c) runaway and 
homeless children are highly susceptible to being domestically trafficked for commercial 
sexual exploitation. According to the National Runaway Switchboard, every day, between 
1,300,000 and 2,800,000 runaway and homeless youth live on the streets. One out of every 
seven children will run away from home before the age of 18.6 Furthermore, according to 
the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), 86% of victims of child 
prostitution are runaways from the child welfare system. Similarly, one service care 
provider stated that 85% of its beneficiaries are runaways from the child welfare system. 
According to some estimates, the average age of entry into prostitution in the United States 
is between 12 and 14 years of age.7 It appears that the most available and frequently cited

</p>
<p>statistics on the scope of domestic child prostitution date back to 2001, highlighting the 
need for more up to date research and analysis. In this regard, the Government reports that 
there are extensive Government-funded studies underway designed to get a better 
understanding of the problem. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the limited 
availability of information on the situation of children involved in prostitution on 
American-Indian reservations.  
</p>
<p>16. Regarding child pornography, authorities noted an increase in the violence of images 
recorded, a decrease in the age of the child victims used as well as the growing availability 
of child pornography on the internet and other evolving technologies and more identifiable 
access thereto.8 Since January 2010, authorities have received 175,000 cybertips of online 
child pornography. The FBI reports that between 1996 and 2007, there was a 2062% 
increase in child exploitation investigations throughout the FBI. The prosecution of cases of 
child pornography increased by 82% from 1994 to 2006. Authorities also noted a 
correlation between child pornography and contact offenses. Possessing and distributing 
child pornography is considered a pathway to sexual assault. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur inquired about allegations that surrogate mothers abroad 
were receiving payment, echoing the concern of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
&#8220;at the information that, according to the current regulations, the payment of prenatal and 
other expenses to birth mothers abroad would still be possible.&#8221; In response to her inquiry, 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that the issue was currently under review.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal framework: numerous laws yet lack of harmonization 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Federal laws  
</i></p>
<p>18. Federal law does not prohibit sale of children per se, but rather proscribes sale of 
children for specific purposes, such as child pornography, child prostitution and adoption.  
For instance, section 2251A under title 18 of the United States Code9 prohibits selling or 
buying of children with knowledge that the child will be portrayed in &#8220;sexually explicit 
conduct&#8221; or with intent to promote the engagement of the child in &#8220;sexually explicit 
conduct&#8221;10, and carries with it a penalty of 30 years to life imprisonment.11 <b> </b>Sex trafficking 
of children, which covers acts of knowingly benefiting, financially or by receiving anything 
of value from sex trafficking of children, is also prohibited.12  Perpetrators of this offence 
are punished by a fine and imprisonment for 10 years at a minimum.13  The Intercountry 
Adoption Act of 2000 specifically criminalizes offering, giving, soliciting or accepting 
compensation intended to influence parental consent relating to the adoption of a child in 
cases where the Hague Convention applies.14  Regulations also set out accreditation 
processes for adoption agencies and prohibit paying, giving, receiving or accepting any 
money aimed at inducing or influencing any decision concerning the adoption of a child.15

</b></p>
<p>These regulations still permit, however, reasonable payments for various services, such as 
payments for medical and other similar expenses incurred by a mother or her child, legal 
services, court costs, and travel or other administrative expenses connected with an 
adoption.16   
</p>
<p>19. While it does not specifically address children, federal law also prohibits sale of a 
person &#8220;into involuntary servitude&#8221;,17 as well as sale, purchase or transfer of human organ 
for use in transplantation, if the transfer affects interstate commerce.18  
</p>
<p>20. In the District of Columbia19, the law prohibits financial benefit from child 
trafficking for sexual exploitation.20 
</p>
<p><i> (b) State laws  
</i></p>
<p>21. At the State level, legislative provisions prohibit sale of persons in the context of 
involuntary servitude21, and sale of children for purposes of adoption22    
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Federal laws  
</i></p>
<p>22. The issue of child prostitution is mainly addressed by state legislation and federal 
law applies only insofar as interstate or foreign commerce is affected.  Thus, title 18 of the 
US Code prohibits, inter alia, transportation across foreign or state borders of a child with 
the intent that the child engages in prostitution,23 and travel in interstate commerce or into 
the US for the purpose of engaging in any commercial sex act with a child.24   
</p>
<p>23. The TVPA prohibits sex trafficking, which is defined as &#8220;the recruitment, harboring, 
transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act&#8221;.  
Where the victim of sex trafficking is under the age of 18 years, the crime is classified as 
one of &#8220;severe forms of trafficking in persons&#8221;.25  Thus, any child who is commercially 
sexually exploited is considered as a victim of &#8220;severe forms of trafficking&#8221; in the United 
States.  The TVPA was re-authorized and amended by the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act (&#8220;TVPRA&#8221;) in 2003, 2005 and 2008, notably to recognize domestic 
victims of trafficking and the extension of assistance to such victims.  The TVPRA 2005 
introduced the term, &#8220;juvenile subjected to trafficking&#8221;, which is defined as a United States 
citizen, or alien admitted for permanent residence, who is the subject of sex trafficking or 
severe forms of trafficking in persons that occurs, in whole or in part, within the United 
States and who has not attained 18 years of age at the time of identification as such. 26  The 
TVPRA 2005 established a pilot program to establish residential treatment facilities in the 
country for minor victims of domestic trafficking27 and the TVRPA 2008 further authorized 
the creation of a program to provide protection and assistance to citizens of the United

<p>States and permanent residents who are victims of severe forms of trafficking.28  The 
TVPRA 2008 also strengthened the policy framework for the protection of unaccompanied 
alien children, including those who are victims of severe forms of trafficking or at risk of 
trafficking, including placement, repatriation and reintegration policies and procedures. The 
TVPRA 2005 focuses on addressing the demand side of trafficking, by authorizing grants 
to establish programs to investigate and prosecute persons who purchase commercial sex 
acts, and educate persons charged with or convicted of purchasing or attempting to 
purchase commercial acts.29    
</p>
<p>24.  The Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children 
Today Act (&#8220;PROTECT Act&#8221;) abolished a statute of limitations for crimes involving the 
abduction or physical or sexual abuse of a child.30 It also applies extraterritorial jurisdiction 
to citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America who travel to engage in 
any commercial sex act with a child, and increased penalties for repeated sex offences 
against children: a person with a prior conviction who commits a sex offence against 
children is sentenced to life imprisonment.31 The 2006 Adam Walsh Protection and Safety 
Act<b> </b>established a national system for the registration of perpetrators of sex offences against 
children and significantly increased penalties for sex offences committed against children, 
such as sexual abuse, sex trafficking and conduct relating to child pornography.   
</p>
<p>25. Enticing or forcibly abducting a child for the purpose of prostitution,32 pandering,33 
parents or guardians consenting their children to be used for prostitution are prohibited34  in 
the District of Columbia, as is the trafficking of children for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation.35 
</p>
<p><i> (b) State laws  
</i></p>
<p>26. In the States the Special Rapporteur visited, she observed that prostitution and acts 
related thereto are widely criminalized, including pandering36, enticing persons into 
prostitution37, engaging in and soliciting for prostitution,38 knowingly advancing or 
profiting from prostitution (pimping)39, keeping a place of prostitution,40 and placing a 
person in the house of prostitution.41 Some States do not have exemptions for children, 
including those who have not reached the age of consent for sexual intercourse.42  This 
often leads to criminalization of children who are victims of commercial sexual 
exploitation.

abduction of minor for prostitution,46 and admitting or keeping minor in house of 
prostitution.47 Trafficking of children for the purposes of sexual exploitation is also 
prohibited in some States.48

aimed at extending protection to child victims of commercial sexual exploitation.  The 2010

prostitution offenses&#8221; of New York allows vacation of a conviction where the convicted 
person committed the offending acts because she or he was a victim of sex trafficking or 
trafficking in persons, as defined under the state law or the TVPA.  In addition, the Safe 
Harbor Act of September 26, 2008 of New York prevents the criminalization of child 
victims of sex trafficking by giving police the option of taking them directly to a safe 
shelter, provided that the court has adjudicated them as Persons In Need of Supervision, 
rather than as juvenile delinquents. However, stakeholders expressed concern that the Safe 
Harbour Act is often not invoked or implemented, implying that children continue to be 
arrested and charged under prostitution-related offences. 
</p>
<p>29. Some difficulties arise when there is inconsistency between federal and state law. 
For instance, a child is defined as a person under 18 under the TVPA. However, under the 
New York Anti-Trafficking Law, a child is defined as a person under 18 years of age in 
some circumstances, and under 17 years of age in others. Furthermore, under the New York 
Anti-Trafficking Law, even for the cases of minors, some form of coercion must be proven 
to qualify as trafficking, which is not a requirement under the TVPA.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Federal laws  
</i></p>
<p>30. Reflecting the reservation made to article 2(c) of the Optional Protocol, the 
definition of child pornography under federal legislation is limited to visual materials, 
including a digital, computer or computer-generated image.49  Title 18 of the US Code 
contains extensive provisions that prohibit acts related to the production, advertisement, 
receipt, distribution, transportation, and possession of child pornography, if the 
pornographic depiction was produced using any materials that had ever been transported in 
interstate or foreign commerce, including by computer, or if the image was transported 
interstate across a U.S. border.50  Violations of these provisions attract serious penalties, 
such as a fine and imprisonment for 15 to 30 years for production or advertisement of child 
pornography.51 The PROTECT Act of 2003 prohibits the production of obscene depictions 
of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and criminalizes extraterritorial 
production of child pornography for distribution in the United States.52 The Special

<p>Rapporteur also welcomes the provision stating that images of child pornography must 
remain in the care, custody and control of the government or the court during criminal 
proceedings.53 Finally, Title 18 also provides for mandatory restitution of all child 
pornography cases, covering &#8220;the full amount of the victim&#8217;s losses&#8221; including expenses 
such as medical services relating to the physical or psychological care or attorney&#8217;s fees.   
</p>
<p>31. In addition, federal law obligates Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who have actual 
knowledge of child pornography on their servers to report such information to the 
CyberTipline of NCMEC. However, the government cannot obligate ISPs to search for 
child pornography due to strict confidentiality restrictions for electronic communications.  
</p>
<p>32. The District of Columbia prohibits, inter alia<i>,</i> knowingly using or promoting a 
sexual performance by a child.54 
</p>
<p><i> (b) State laws  
</i></p>
<p>33. All the States that the Special Rapporteur visited have legislation which contains 
extensive prohibitions related to child pornography, including knowingly using or 
promoting a sexual performance by a child55, promoting, preparing, advertising, 
distributing, and possessing child pornography56 . The Official Code of Georgia Annotated 
also specifically prohibits intentional or wilful use of a computer on-line service or Internet 
service, such as Internet chat room and on-line messaging service, to solicit or entice a child 
to commit sexual offences,57 as well as the act of &#8220;obscene Internet contact with a child&#8221;.58 
</p>
<p>34. While the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the breadth of the state legislation 
covering a wide range of acts relating to child pornography, it is of concern that there seems 
to be no uniformity in the definition of a child for the purpose of child pornography.  In 
some States, a child is a person under 16 years old or 17 years old, depending on the nature 
of acts involved.     
</p>
<p><b>  C. Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Federal institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>35. Several federal Government departments are involved in efforts to prevent and 
combat the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>36. Numerous sections within the Department of Justice are involved in investigating 
and prosecuting crimes relating to child exploitation. The Child Exploitation and Obscenity 
Section of the Criminal Division investigates and prosecutes federal cases involving child 
sexual exploitation, such as sex trafficking and sex tourism, in conjunction with the Crimes 
against Children Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). They also provide 
training to other prosecutors and agents.

<p>37. The United States National Central Bureau acts as the official representative to 
Interpol as designated by the Attorney General. It exchanges criminal investigative data 
with international counterparts. In cooperation with other agencies, it tracks sex offenders 
who travel overseas, and coordinates international alerts relating to child exploitation. It has 
recently created a post on Human Trafficking and Child Protection.  
</p>
<p>38. The United States Attorney&#8217;s Office is the federal prosecutor with representatives in 
each State. They prosecute federal cases involving child sexual exploitation, including all 
cases with an inter-state or federal dimension, and thus cover online child pornography 
cases. 
</p>
<p>39. The Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
focuses on the international, trans-border dimension of child exploitation. In this regard, it 
coordinates enforcement efforts between the national level and state and local law 
enforcement agencies. It also coordinates efforts with foreign law enforcement to identify 
and arrest the principals involved in international child exploitation or child sex tourism 
networks. Operation Predator, launched in 2003, is designed to identify, investigate and, as 
appropriate, administratively deport child predators such as child pornographers, child sex 
tourists and facilitators, human smugglers and traffickers of minors. Over 18,000 sexual 
predators reportedly have been arrested as a result of Operation Predator.  The 
Department&#8217;s Citizenship and Immigration Services provides immigration relief for foreign 
victims of human trafficking, child exploitation and child sex tourism, child abuse, 
abandonment and neglect, and refugees through various programs. It also oversees and 
regulates international adoptions. 
</p>
<p>40. With a view to strengthening coordination amongst all these agencies, pursuant to 
the PROTECT our Children Act of 200859, the Department of Justice (Office of the Deputy 
Attorney General) appointed a National Coordinator for Child Exploitation, Prevention and 
Interdiction in January 2010, who serves as the Department&#8217;s liaison with all federal 
agencies regarding the development and implementation of a national strategy to combat 
child sexual exploitation, and whose objective is to ensure proper coordination among 
agencies involved in child exploitation, prevention and interdiction.  
</p>
<p>41. The Administration for Children and Families division of the Department of Health 
and Human Services  funds state, territory, local and tribal organizations to provide family 
assistance (welfare), child support, child care, child welfare and other programs relating to 
children and families.  Direct services are provided at the state, county, city or tribal levels, 
by public and private local agencies. The Children&#8217;s Bureau is housed within the 
Administration for Children and Families, and provides funding, training, guidance through 
policy, and monitoring the implementation of federal laws and policies. It works with 
Federal and local agencies to develop programs focused on preventing and protecting 
children from abuse as well as governing the adoption and foster care system in areas 
receiving Federal funding.  </p>
<p>42. The Children&#8217;s Bureau monitors State child welfare services through &#8220;Child and 
Family Services Reviews&#8221; (CFS Reviews) &#8220;Eligibility for funding&#8221; reviews and others. The 
&#8220;Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System&#8221; is a data collection system that 
provides information to assist monitoring systems. The Child and Family Services Reviews 
cover all 50 States&#8217; Child and Family Services on a rotating basis, and as measured against 
national standards. On the basis of the reviews, Program Improvement Plans are proposed

</p>
<p>and final reports issued identifying strengths and areas for improvement. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes these monitoring mechanisms. </p>
<p>43. The Office of Refugee Resettlement within the Administration for Children and 
Families funds the National Trafficking Resource Centre, a national, toll-free hotline (1-
888-3737-888 or NHTRC@PolarisProject.org), which is operated by an anti-trafficking 
NGO. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year, and provides 
callers with a range of comprehensive services, including crisis intervention, urgent and 
non-urgent referrals, tip reporting, anti-trafficking resources and technical assistance. The 
centre maintains a national database of relevant organizations and individuals as well as a 
library of resources and materials. </p>
<p>44. The Victim Assistance office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement works 
directly with foreign victims of sexual exploitation who have been trafficked into the 
country, and provides responses to victims of child pornography, child sex tourism, white 
collar crime and human rights abuse cases. Its 18 full time victim assistance coordinators 
(social workers, psychologists) and 350 collateral duty victim assistance coordinators are 
trained in victims&#8217; issues, undertake child forensic interviews, operate transitional housing 
with 24 hour security and provide on-site victim assistance in cooperation with civil society 
organisations.  </p>
<p><b> 2. Federal and State cooperation efforts 
</b></p>
<p>45. Numerous task forces have been established to improve coordination efforts 
between federal and state authorities in combating and preventing child prostitution and 
child pornography. 
</p>
<p>46. The ICAC Task Force is a network of 61 coordinated task forces to assist state and 
local law enforcement agencies develop effective investigative and prosecutorial responses 
to cyber-enticement and child pornography cases. Since 1998, ICAC task forces across the 
country have arrested nearly 17,000 offenders. Local law enforcement agents and 
prosecutors are trained on combating online child pornography. It is funded by the Office of 
Justice Program of the Department of Justice, which oversees the disbursement of millions 
of dollars in grants to federal, state and local agencies to aid in the fight against child 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>47. In June 2003 the Innocence Lost National Initiative was launched by the Department 
of Justice and NCMEC. The initiative brings together state and federal law enforcement 
agencies, prosecutors and social service providers in order to address the issue of domestic 
child prostitution. The initiative is comprised of 34 task forces and working groups. It trains 
state and local officials and NGOs on identification and protection of prostituted children, 
as well as detection and prosecution of pimps and clients in cities which have high 
incidences of child prostitution. The initiative operates a database for all task forces across 
the country, and contains information on pimps or traffickers from one jurisdiction and 
which is accessible by other task forces across the country. As at December 2009, more 
than 300 key law enforcement personnel had been trained. Additionally, DOJ has trained 
upwards of 1000 people on victim identification.60 In the first 6 years, this initiative has 
identified almost 900 child victims of prostitution, obtained 510 convictions in state and 
federal courts, and seized over $3 million in property and assets.61

</b></p>
<p>48. In 2006, the Department of Justice launched Project Safe Childhood, which aims to 
combat the proliferation of technology-facilitated sexual exploitation crimes against 
children. It is implemented in partnership between numerous federal, state and local law 
enforcement officials and NCMEC. As of May 29, 2009, a total of 2,312 victims of child 
pornography crimes have been identified and many rescued, over 1000 of them since the 
launch of Project Safe Childhood. US Attorney&#8217;s Offices filed 2,315 indictments in fiscal 
year 2009 against 2,427 defendants, representing a 40% increase over fiscal year 2006.62  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur also notes the President&#8217;s Interagency Task Force a cabinet-
level task force to coordinate federal efforts to combat human trafficking, and its Senior 
Policy Operating Group, which implements anti-trafficking policies and guidelines. 
</p>
<p>50. Despite these numerous initiatives, stakeholders reported that information sharing 
amongst agencies at the federal and State levels as well as effective coordination remain 
significant challenges. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. State Institutional Framework and challenges in responses at the State level 
</b></p>
<p>51. Under the United States&#8217; governmental structure, child and family- related laws and 
policies are implemented at the State level. Police services are at the city level, and State 
District Attorneys prosecute State-level crimes. Child pornography can be prosecuted at 
either level, whereas cases of domestic prostitution tend to be treated at the State level. 
</p>
<p>52. In some jurisdictions, police officers have the authority to do undercover operations 
in the streets and identify girls involved in prostitution, with the aim of rescuing them. They 
also undertake operations targeting the pimp or the client, but admit difficulties in tracing 
and tackling the criminal networks that traffic and sell children. The Special Rapporteur 
was impressed with the technical capacities of the Los Angeles Police Department and the 
ICAC Task Force in tracking and detecting online child pornography. They also undertake 
undercover &#8220;grooming&#8221; operations, posing as children in order to catch sexual predators.  
</p>
<p>53. Reportedly children involved in prostitution are charged, detained and processed 
through the juvenile justice system for a number of reasons, depending on the jurisdiction. 
They can be detained because the State law criminalizes prostitution, and thus the girls are 
considered as criminals; or they can be detained for their own safety, and in order to secure 
their cooperation in eventual prosecutions against the pimp. In some jurisdictions such as 
Clark County, charges of prostitution are rare; rather the children are charged with lesser 
offences such as solicitation for the purposes of prostitution, loitering for the purposes of 
prostitution, being in a gaming establishment, curfew violations, and providing false 
information to a police officer.  
</p>
<p>54. Representatives of the Los Angeles Police Department stated that once they identify 
a girl, they try to liaise with NGOs providing direct services, or with the foster care system. 
They stated that, in the worst case scenario, they may arrest her as it is often the only choice 
to get the girl off the streets. Similarly, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 
stated that the absence of a safe house in Las Vegas means that pre-adjudication detention 
(up to a period of 8 days) is the only alternative to get the girls off the street and to protect 
them. Of further concern is that few protective services (therapy, counseling, mental health) 
are provided to the victims in pre-adjudication detention. 
</p>
<p>55. According to law enforcement in numerous cities visited, significant challenges exist 
to effective investigation and prosecution of cases of child prostitution. The cooperation of 
the victim is often seen as the only way to secure a conviction against the pimp/trafficker 
</p>
<p>  
 62 National Strategy, p. 5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>(see below); such cooperation is often difficult to obtain, due to a lack of trust in law 
enforcement. Furthermore, despite the successes of the Innocence Lost Initiative, law 
enforcement authorities reiterated the need for increased cooperation with their counterparts 
in other states. The fact that pimps and traffickers are increasingly moving the child victims 
between states poses particular challenges: for example, 60% of children involved in 
prostitution in Nevada are from out of state. If a girl runs away from the foster care system 
in California and is found in Nevada, the Nevada authorities are under an obligation to send 
her back under court order to California as she is considered a ward of the State of 
California. This essentially sends the girl back to the very situation she was running away 
from. Furthermore, the laws of some States restrict the kinds of information that can be 
shared with other States; other States do not have specialized units in child prostitution, 
making it difficult to agree on methods of work and the best ways to share information. 
Stakeholders also call for more resources and capacity building of law enforcement for 
computer forensics and combating cybercrime more generally, with a view to accelerating 
and increasing the effectiveness of prosecutions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Policies to combat the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography 
</b></p>
<p>56. The PROTECT our Children Act 2008 requires the Department of Justice to 
formulate and implement a National Strategy to combat child exploitation and to submit an 
annual report to Congress on progress, containing a proposed set of goals and priorities for 
reducing child exploitation. In July 2010, the Department of Justice submitted its first 
report to Congress on the National Strategy for Child Exploitation, Prevention and 
Interdiction<b> </b>(the &#8220;National Strategy&#8221;). The stated overall objectives of the National Strategy 
are to reduce the incidence of sexual exploitation of children, and to prevent child sexual 
exploitation from occurring in the first place. The National Strategy identified the following 
five priority areas: (1) child pornography; (2) online enticement of children for sexual 
purposes; (3) commercial sexual exploitation of children; (4) child sex tourism; and (5) 
commercial sexual exploitation of children in Indian country, and reflects a threat 
assessment that was conducted in each of those areas.  The Special Rapporteur was pleased 
to learn that a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling these phenomena is envisioned in the 
National Strategy, which must include not only investigators and prosecutors, but also 
social service providers, educators, medical professional, academics, non-governmental 
organizations, and members of industry, as well as parents and families.63 
</p>
<p>57. As part of its Cyber Crime Programme, the FBI runs the Innocent Images National 
Initiative, which combats online child pornography. It is a central coordination point for 
information on individuals who indicate a willingness to travel interstate for the purpose of 
engaging in sexual activity with a minor, and also on major producers and/or distributors of 
child pornography. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also learned about a National Internet Crimes against 
Children Data System (NIDS), to facilitate online law enforcement investigations of child 
exploitation which is run by the FBI.  
</p>
<p>59. Nevertheless, despite the above-mentioned policies and initiatives, the lack of a 
standardized and centralized information system running across agencies and the 
insufficiency of coordination were cited as challenges to effective investigation, 
prosecution and child protection. 
</p>
<p>  
 63 National Strategy, p. 137. </p>

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Care and assistance programmes  
</b></p>
<p>60. Providing effective care and assistance to child victims of prostitution is a complex 
process, due to the particular nature of the difficulties they face, their history, their varied 
profiles and social perceptions. A significant number of the child victims of prostitution in 
the United States have a history of physical or sexual abuse, have run away from home or 
from foster care, and have, to some extent, grown accustomed to life on the street, living on 
their own and finding means of survival. Children who have been involved in prostitution, 
particularly those who have pimps, often do not see or feel the trauma they are 
experiencing, and have developed a strong attachment to their pimps. Thus, tailoring 
treatment programs to each individual case and ensuring their effectiveness is essential.  
</p>
<p>61. <b> </b>Through the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, the Family and Youth 
Services Bureau of the Administration of Children and Families funds street outreach, 
short-term shelter, and longer-term transitional living and maternity group home programs.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>62. Regarding complaint and reporting mechanisms, there are numerous hotlines 
dedicated to reporting incidents of human trafficking or child abuse or exploitation. Most 
notably, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about the efficiency of the 
CyberTipline (1-800-THE-LOST). It is a Congressionally-mandated hotline, run by 
NCMEC, as a means of reporting incidents of child sexual exploitation including 
possession, manufacture, and/or distribution of child pornography; online enticement of 
children for sexual acts; child prostitution; sex tourism involving children; extrafamilial 
child sexual molestation; unsolicited obscene material sent to a child; misleading domain 
names, words or digital images on the Internet. Stakeholders also mentioned the 
effectiveness of the Amber Alert program, which activates urgent bulletins in child-
abduction cases. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur visited programs and shelters for child victims of 
commercial sexual exploitation run by civil society organizations. One such program 
provides direct services to girl victims of commercial sexual exploitation or trafficking in 
New York City. The girls range in age from 11 to 23 years of age. Services include 
assistance with legal proceedings (court advocacy), psychological and trauma care, case 
management, transition to independent living (including crisis housing), education, 
recreational and therapeutic groups, youth employment and leadership training, vocational 
programs, an alternative to incarceration program and referral services. The Special 
Rapporteur also visited programs in Los Angeles and Atlanta, the former accepting both 
boys and girls. Both programs provide shelter services, schooling, and individual therapy, 
work closely with local law enforcement authorities, and prioritize designing life projects 
with the children. The shelter in Atlanta also offers family therapy. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur was particularly impressed with her visit to the Child 
Advocacy Center of Manhattan, which included child friendly spaces. The Centre is state-
run, and receives funding from the State of New York as well as from private funders. It 
operates on a referral basis, further to calls received on a hotline or from Child Protective 
Services. If deemed urgent, an investigator and a case worker are assigned to the case, and 
the child is sent to the Center. The Child Advocacy Centre provides multi-disciplinary care 
in treating a case, with staff and representatives from: administration for children&#8217;s 
services, the New York County District Attorney&#8217;s Office, the child abuse squad of the 
Special Victims Unit of the New York Police Department (who run a full police station in 
the building), Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Safe Horizon 
NGO, who are all housed under one roof. As at October 2010, the Centre had received 600 
cases for the year. 
</p>
<p>65. The Child Advocacy Centre deals with cases of child physical and sexual abuse, 
including cases of inappropriate touching and rape. The Centre occasionally receives cases </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>of child prostitution, such as a recent case of a mother who had prostituted her own 
children. The Centre is linked to an NGO in the same building which focuses on human 
trafficking, and who can connect the child victim with direct service providers. However, 
the representative of the Centre admitted that addressing cases of children involved in 
prostitution is challenging due to a lack of suitable treatment programs.  
</p>
<p>66. Services provided include orientation, forensic interviews, client and family 
advocacy, and medical evaluation with a pediatrician. The multi-disciplinary team meets 
first with the family of the child, explains the process as well as counseling options that are 
available. Then one person from the team interviews the child, with representatives from 
child protective services, the District Attorney&#8217;s Office and the New York Police 
Department in an observation room. The interview is not videotaped. The child also has a 
medical examination, where specimens are drawn and can be eventually used as evidence 
in legal proceedings. Child protective services are in charge of the follow up of the children 
who come to the centre. Children may be placed in emergency housing in downtown New 
York City until the child can be placed with a relative or in foster care.  
</p>
<p>67. Since different agencies must collaborate on an ongoing basis, some challenges 
identified include difficulties in coordinating their methods of work. The Special 
Rapporteur also learned about the need for more trained professionals and services that are 
evidence-based. The representative of the Centre also expressed the need for more work to 
be done on prevention of child sexual abuse and abuse within families.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur also visited an impressive non profit organization that 
provides a range of programs for high risk families in Compton, Los Angeles. Its goal is to 
promote family reunification and support families remaining intact in the community 
through the provision of comprehensive and collaborative services, based on the family 
centered treatment model. Programs focus on substance abuse, mental health, youth, child 
development, family preservation, family support (including therapy and counseling), 
prevention, adoption, vocational services, low-income housing, transportation and a food 
bank. The organization serves more than 5,000 families each year, and has a full-time staff 
of over 320 at three different sites in South Central Los Angeles. Testimonies revealed that 
a number of the beneficiaries of the programs got involved in prostitution when they were 
under 18. 
</p>
<p>69. A common challenge in providing care and assistance services to child victims of 
prostitution is that they sometimes don&#8217;t view themselves as victims. If they are placed in 
foster care or in the social services system, or in a group home or NGO that is not locked, 
minors frequently run back into the streets. To address some of these concerns, a joint 
initiative in Las Vegas, Clark County, between a Juvenile Court Judge, the Assistant 
District Attorney and the Public Defender aims at establishing an integrated residential 
treatment facility for child victims of prostitution. The facility would consist of a safe house 
that is supervised by a juvenile probation officer to ensure that the girls would not try to 
escape. Legal and mental health services, as well as schooling, activities and job training 
would be offered.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was particularly impressed with the concept and work of the 
Georgia Care Connection, which is a state-wide initiative of the Governor&#8217;s Office for 
Children and Families that coordinates care services for child victims of commercial sexual 
exploitation. It is composed of numerous stakeholders, including Juvenile Courts, law 
enforcement, the Department of Juvenile Justice, prosecutors, Department of Family and 
Child Services, community providers and safe houses. It is based on a &#8220;system of care&#8221; 
approach, where families and youth work together with public and private organizations to 
design individualized services guided by an individualized service plan. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the fact that it is child centered and community based, but regrets that 
these services are not yet available to boys. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>71. NCMEC, a not for profit organization with a congressional mandate, provides 
information and resources regarding missing and exploited children in the United States. It 
operates as a &#8220;clearing house&#8221;, with data and analysis on missing and/or sexually exploited 
children, as well as on traffickers and pimps, and works regularly with law enforcement to 
share information and track cases.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the child victims from various programs who 
shared their thoughts and views on challenges they face and for their suggestions on how 
child victims can be better protected and the exploitation of children through prostitution 
prevented. Suggestions include the need for more local and community-based walk in 
and/or crisis intervention centres and accessible mechanisms where children can share their 
experience, get information, or report violations. A concern expressed by one child victim 
was the need to strengthen ethics by the media in reporting cases of child prostitution.  
</p>
<p>73. As regards assistance to foreign child victims of trafficking, the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement (ORR) issues Eligibility Letters granting minor foreign victims of trafficking 
access to Federal benefits and services to the same extent as refugees, including placement 
in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program, which provides specialized, culturally 
appropriate foster care or other licensed care settings, according to children&#8217;s individual 
needs. US Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security 
grants immigration relief to foreign trafficking victims, allowing them to remain and work 
in the United States.  Victims of sex trafficking under the age of 18 do not need to show 
cooperation with law enforcement.  Victims of other crimes, including domestic violence 
and sexual assault, sex tourism and other crimes affecting children, are available for similar 
relief.  Child victims can also bring their family members to the United States.  In addition, 
foreign victims of child abuse, abandonment, neglect and other similar crimes who are 
involved in one of the state welfare systems may be eligible for relief allowing them to 
remain and work in the United States. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur echoes the concerns raised by the vast majority of 
stakeholders she met with regarding the insufficient number of residential treatment 
facilities that provide integrated, comprehensive care to child victims of commercial sexual 
exploitation. While the TVPRA 2005 and 2008 provide for such facilities, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the funding had not yet been granted. The need for increased 
access to mental health services was also cited. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Cooperation of victims and their treatment in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>75. Virtually all stakeholders, including law enforcement, state attorneys, federal 
prosecutors and members of civil society complained of difficulties in securing the 
cooperation of child victims with the authorities in legal proceedings against pimps or 
traffickers.  
</p>
<p>76. Several stakeholders in numerous states visited reported on the problem of requiring 
child victims to testify in open court in front of their trafficker or pimp. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses concern that for instance, in New York State, testimony through 
closed circuit television is only available in the case of &#8220;demonstrated risk of significant 
emotional trauma&#8221; to the child. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that requiring victims 
to testify against their exploiters in open court as a means of obtaining a conviction can lead 
to re-victimization. This can be even more difficult when the exploiter deceived or coerced 
the victim into believing their relationship was &#8220;love.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that in the State of Louisiana, video 
taped testimony/interviews from Child Advocacy Centres can be used as evidence in court. 
The use of video testimony of children is also permitted in Georgia. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>78. In this regard, procedural reforms are needed to allow prosecution of perpetrators 
without victim/witness testimony. Requiring victims to testify against their exploiters can 
sometimes lead to re-victimization as the child must relive the trauma in a courtroom.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Prevention and tackling root causes 
</b></p>
<p>79. Prevention of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography must go 
beyond awareness raising campaigns, and must tackle the root causes of these phenomena. 
As mentioned above, the high rate of runaways in the United States is one of the main 
factors of vulnerability of children to be involved in prostitution. The Special Rapporteur 
was pleased to learn that in Florida and Illinois, child protective services have the legal 
obligation to report missing children from their services to NCMEC. Almost all 
stakeholders agreed that more work needed to be done to prevent these practices from 
occurring in the first place. 
</p>
<p>80. In this regard, many stressed the need for more outreach work to be done with 
children living in the streets. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to have met with a 
representative of Child Protective Services of Los Angeles County and learned about the 
&#8220;Runaway Outreach Program&#8221;, which works directly with runaway youth or youth living in 
the streets, or who have a history of runaway and pre-delinquent behavior between the ages 
of 11 and 17. The program provides secondary case carrying assistance, focused on helping 
youth get off the streets, locating appropriate placement settings and providing reunification 
services where possible. The program assists primary child welfare services in stabilizing 
youth who have runaway from the care of child protective services. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur learned about other street outreach programs, for instance 
one in Los Angeles which works with about 40-60 children a day. Its outreach program 
includes going into the streets, informing them of their program and case management 
services, including psychological and medical services. Staff of this NGO often refers cases 
to the Child Advocacy Centre in Los Angeles, and vice versa.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about initiatives to tackle demand for 
services that exploit children. The First Offender Prostitution Programme includes, inter 
alia, a &#8220;John School&#8221; which is an eight-hour seminar in lieu of prosecution. Educators on 
the justice system, public health, domestic violence and trafficking in girls as well as 
former prostitutes address customers' ignorance about the nature of the sex industry, 
including  the economics of pimping, the recruitment and abuse of young girls and the risks 
and effects of prostitution. This programme has been replicated in numerous States, the 
evaluation of which is ongoing. She was also informed about a research project undertaken 
on demand for prostitution in 4 countries, including the United States.   
</p>
<p>83. The Children&#8217;s Bureau was of the view that more efforts were needed to prevent 
over-burdening the foster care and adoption system, by focusing and increasing funding for 
in-home services before the need arises to remove the child from the home. While the 
adoption policy is to shorten the length of stay in foster care, reduce the number of children 
in foster care, improve the quality of services and encourage adoption when it&#8217;s in the 
child&#8217;s best interests, stakeholders called for more systems designed to identify high risk 
children at an early stage, and specialized programmes to address such situations. By the 
same token, the Children&#8217;s Bureau stressed the need for improved follow-up of foster care 
and adoptive families.  
</p>
<p>84. As mentioned above, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern at ongoing social 
perceptions that children involved in prostitution &#8220;choose the life&#8221;. She welcomes 
information that NCMEC staff has recorded some recent success in training law 
enforcement on the nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children: children under 18 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>involved in prostitution are victims of commercial sexual exploitation, rather than 
criminals, irrespective of the age of sexual consent.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Awareness-raising and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur learned about numerous awareness raising campaigns 
regarding human trafficking, child pornography and safe internet use. While too numerous 
to list here, some anti-trafficking campaigns at the Department of Homeland Security 
include the Blue Campaign, the Hidden in Plain Sight public awareness campaign, No Te 
Enga&#241;es, Operation Safe Kids and Rescue and Restore Victims of Human Trafficking. The 
Department of Education has also prepared a Human Trafficking Fact Sheet which is 
distributed in schools, and developed an extensive website with numerous resources. 
Regarding online child pornography, a National Public Awareness Campaign regarding 
Internet safety was launched in 2008 by the Department of Justice in collaboration with 
Project Safe Childhood partners, iKeepSafe and the Hispanic Communications Network.  
</p>
<p>86. Numerous trainings have also occurred on detecting commercial sexual exploitation 
and on strengthening investigations and prosecutions. The Federal Law Enforcement 
Training Center of the Department of Homeland Security trains federal, state and local law 
enforcement officers on human trafficking and how to detect it. The Centre hopes to train 
over 200,000 officers nationwide through electronic training tools.  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about a &#8220;survivor-led outreach 
program&#8221; of one of the organizations she visited, where survivors who have been 
beneficiaries of its services remain involved by providing awareness raising activities in 
schools and detention centers on commercial sexual exploitation. The staff at this NGO also 
trains service providers, law enforcement and legal professionals to identify signs of 
exploitation and on intervention techniques. 
</p>
<p>88. Worryingly, the Special Rapporteur received reports that staff at child protective 
services in certain jurisdictions does not receive training to identify domestic child victims 
of prostitution.  </p>
<p>89. Despite the large number of awareness raising campaigns and trainings offered, the 
Special Rapporteur echoes the views of stakeholders that more focused campaigns and 
trainings on commercial sexual exploitation of domestic children are needed.  </p>
<p><b> I. Monitoring  
</b></p>
<p>90. Despite the various complaint and reporting mechanisms described earlier, the 
Special Rapporteur notes, at least in the cities she visited, the absence of local and 
community based complaint mechanisms that are accessible to all children, without 
discrimination, and which protect their privacy and confidentiality. Relative mistrust of law 
enforcement, including local police, was frequently cited as an obstacle to timely reporting 
of violations. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur also notes the absence of an independent child rights 
institution tasked with monitoring measures undertaken to protect victims of and prevent 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, as well as restore their rights. 
The institution should also be tasked with monitoring the implementation and 
dissemination of the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b> J. Cooperation with the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>92. The private sector has made significant steps in protecting the use of their 
technology from abuse by child exploiters, sometimes going beyond the minimum legal 
reporting requirement. Both Microsoft and America Online (AOL) use their technology to 
block children from sexual material and to detect child predators. The Internet Safety 
Program, a partnership between Microsoft and NCMEC, uses software to identify and 
analyze images of child pornography, report the images to NCMEC, and deny the 
purveyors profit. This partnership also conducts trainings for law enforcement globally; to 
date they have trained 1,300 law enforcement officers from eighty-nine countries on the 
issue of high tech crime relating to commercial sexual exploitation of children. Microsoft 
develops tracking capacities to detect child pornography and information-sharing systems 
for law enforcement, including a partnership between Interpol and the Virtual Global Task 
Force. Many advocates look to them as a model for incorporation of other internet service 
providers into child protection programs.  
</p>
<p>93. NCMEC has also been working with leading credit card companies and financial 
corporations to build a financial coalition against child pornography. This coalition would 
prevent buyers of child pornography from using electronic billing or disguised charges, 
thereby reducing the anonymity of the internet. AOL has worked with law enforcement to 
identify and report images of child pornography and the individuals who distribute them.  
</p>
<p>94. Nevertheless, some challenges remain. Allegedly, while travel and tourism 
companies are quite collaborative in sharing information (eg. travel records), some internet 
companies and to a greater extent, social networking sites, are still the most reticent in 
terms of sharing information with authorities. Trade unions in the transportation sector as 
well as the media could also play a key role in prevention and awareness raising.  
</p>
<p><b> K. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur commends the considerable efforts undertaken in the area of 
international and regional cooperation to combat child trafficking for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation. The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, funds programs to 
combat this problem in over 60 countries that focus on prevention and restorative services 
for victims.  
</p>
<p>96. There is frequent cooperation with foreign law enforcement officials on child sex 
tourism; Operation Twisted Traveler undertaken in cooperation with Cambodia is a prime 
example of effective international cooperation. Some difficulties remain however, due to 
divergent legislation and lack of political will of some countries to cooperate in 
investigations and prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>97. The United States of America is a member of the Virtual Global Taskforce to 
combat online child abuse and it participated at the three World Congresses on Commercial 
Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur was also pleased to meet with representatives of the 
International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which works to share and 
exchange global resources to find missing children and prevent child sexual exploitation. It 
promotes the creation of centers around the world modeled on the National Centre for 
Missing and Exploited Children, provides training to relevant officials, advocates on child 
protection issues and organizes international expert conferences to build awareness and 
increase international cooperation and collaboration.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>99. At the regional level, the United States of America is a member of the Organisation 
of American States and has adopted the regional workplan to combat human trafficking and 
reduce vulnerability. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>During the visit, interlocutors noted the growing availability of child 
pornography online, the use of ever younger children and an increase in the violence 
of images recorded. They further highlighted the persistence of child prostitution, 
principally involving girls. While it is difficult to conclude whether the increasing 
number of reported cases of these phenomena is due to a veritable increase, or rather 
due to better detection, their true scope remains difficult to measure in part due to the 
absence of a standardized, centralized information gathering and treatment system. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Identification and detection efforts by federal and state authorities of child 
pornography, particularly online, are significant and commendable. Cyber-
technologies are cutting-edge, and can continue to be reinforced; rates of prosecution 
and conviction are on the increase and collaborative efforts across state and federal 
lines, evidenced by the creation of cross-agency task forces, are yielding positive 
results. International cooperation efforts in combating child sex tourism are equally 
encouraging.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The recognition of domestic minor victims of trafficking in anti-trafficking 
legislation and the adoption of safe harbour laws in some jurisdictions are welcome 
steps in the fight against child prostitution, as is the creation of initiatives such as 
Innocence Lost. However, a key challenge remains the lack of harmonization between 
Federal and state legislation, and between States, for instance regarding the definition 
of the age of a child. Further, law enforcement in certain jurisdictions still identifies 
children involved in prostitution as criminals rather than as victims. Detaining 
children involved in prostitution also occurs due to a lack of viable and safe placement 
alternatives for children where they can receive the care and protection they need.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The persistence of child pornography and child prostitution as well as their 
complex root causes, point to an urgent need to move beyond awareness-raising 
campaigns. Effective prevention must include stronger support to communities and 
families, working on social perceptions, addressing the situation of children at risk, 
and tackling the demand for sex with children, particularly the roles of buyers, 
intermediaries and traffickers. The efficiency of strategies and programmes 
undertaken can be improved through better coordination and allocation of resources. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the National Strategy 
for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction, but encourages the United States 
of America to ensure the evaluation and monitoring of its implementation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>In the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
following specific recommendations to the Government, aimed at consolidating and 
strengthening ongoing efforts. She is assured that every effort will be made to 
implement them and stands ready to offer her full cooperation and assistance in this 
regard. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>Regarding legislation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government and States as appropriate: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Decriminalize the involvement of children under 18 in prostitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Effectively implement safe harbour laws for child prostitution to ensure 
that all children under 18 are not treated as criminals or juvenile delinquents, 
irrespective of the age of sexual consent in the State;</b>  
</p>
<p><b> (d) More readily consider allowing the use of closed circuit television and/or 
video testimony for children under 18 years of age.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government keep her informed 
of all developments regarding efforts to review regulations according to which the 
payment of prenatal and other expenses to birth mothers abroad would still be 
possible.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Regarding policies and strategies, the Special Rapporteur calls for the adoption 
of an integrated and comprehensive approach that is child centered. This is necessary 
due to the multidimensional and complex root causes of the phenomena, the 
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary aspect of child protection and the wide range 
of stakeholders at different levels. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government and States as appropriate to:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen the prevention elements of the National Strategy for Child 
Exploitation, Prevention and Interdiction; add child protection indicators, thus 
allowing for an integrated policy, monitoring of its implementation and measure of its 
impact. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Undertake a mapping of actors and programmes to avoid duplication 
and increase clarity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen the sharing of information and collaboration between the 
federal and state law enforcement authorities, and between states. To the extent 
possible, this should include harmonizing methods of work to increase efficiency; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Follow up and evaluate strategies, programmes and practices by 
establishing child protection indicators to measure impact of these strategies and the 
evolution of the situation of children.</b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b> Regarding care and assistance programs the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government, and States as appropriate: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Create a special section within state/county child protective services 
trained and specialized in working with children involved in prostitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Increase the number of programs, at the local level, which provide multi-
disciplinary care and assistance (medical, legal, psychological) to child victims of 
commercial sexual exploitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establish child friendly complaint mechanisms, accessible to children at 
the local level and without discrimination, which guarantee the privacy and 
confidentiality of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Increase and systematize psychological assistance/evaluations for officers 
and officials working on child prostitution and child pornography; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Strengthen Child Advocacy Centres across the country by ensuring that 
they have child friendly spaces and are provided with sufficient financial and human 
resources. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Regarding prevention, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government and States as appropriate: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen human resources and increase funding to child protective 
services;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Increase funding for in-home and family-based services before the need 
arises to remove the child from the home, and increase access to social and economic 
services to vulnerable children, families and communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Increase and strengthen the provision of mental health care services at 
the state and local level; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strengthen follow-up procedures of foster care and adoptive families; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Promote social norms with a view to changing perceptions and attitudes 
regarding child prostitution;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Increase research and analysis on the phenomena and on the profile of 
clients of child prostitution and child pornography, with a view to tackling demand.</b> 
</p>
<p>110. <b>Regarding training, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government, 
and States as appropriate: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen capacity of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, 
teachers and other professionals working directly with children on how to identify 
cases of commercial sexual exploitation of children, and on how to address them 
within their respective environments. Training activities should identify and address 
social perceptions, and highlight that the involvement of children in prostitution is 
exploitation not a choice;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Increase resources and training of law enforcement for computer 
forensics and combating cybercrime more generally, with a view to accelerating and 
increasing the effectiveness of prosecutions.</b> 
</p>
<p>111. <b>The Government should establish a standardized and centralized information-
gathering system which should provide for disaggregating data by sex, age, type of 
violation and measures taken, as well as harmonized methods of gathering and 
processing data. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Regarding child participation, the Government, and States as appropriate, 
should increase information, to consultation and participation of children in all 
matters affecting them. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Regarding monitoring, the Special Rapporteur calls for the establishment of an</b> 
in<b>dependent child rights institution tasked with monitoring measures undertaken to 
protect victims of and prevent the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, as well as restore their rights. The institution should also be tasked with 
monitoring the implementation of and disseminating the Optional Protocol on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Regarding Corporate social responsibility, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
the Government to develop and strengthen partnerships with the private sector, 
particularly tourism agencies, travel agencies, internet service providers, 
telecommunication companies, banks, trade unions in the transportation sector, and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b> 
</p>
<p><b>media in all efforts to combat the sexual exploitation of children, including child sex 
tourism and the exploitation of children online.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Regarding international and regional cooperation,  the Government should 
continue pursuing cooperation  through technical and logistical assistance on themes 
such as combating cybercrime, trafficking, transnational organized crime, by sharing 
information relating to the detection of the crimes and identification of child victims, 
and to the prosecution of offenders. </b></p>
