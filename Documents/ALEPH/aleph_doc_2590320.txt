MANAGING DIRECTOR’S COMMENTS 
Triangle’s focus for the quarter was the execution of a share sale agreement with AWE Limited (AWE) and 
completion of the 57.5% acquisition of the producing Cliff Head oil field.
The  purchase  of  Cliff  Head  marks  Triangle’s  successful  execution  of  its  new  strategy  to  become  an 
Australian  focused  oil  producing  company  post  sale  completion  of  the  Indonesian  Pase  Field  asset  in 
February 2016.
Cliff Head offers significant production and cash flow to Triangle with an average June daily production rate 
of 1,174 bbl/d of oil and significant remaining 2P reserves of 3.8 mmboe1. We are currently working with the 
Operator (ROC Oil 42.5%) to optimise production and reduce operating costs.
Since  the  acquisition  on  30  June  2016,  Triangle  has  received  June  2016  revenue  of  $1.2  million  with  
estimates  for  the  next  quarter  revenue  of  $3.3  million.  Triangle’s  Cliff  Head  asset  provides  a  strong 
foundation  for  the  company’s  growth  by  providing  robust  operating  cash  flows  with  potential  for  margin 
expansion through further reducing operating costs. Furthermore, Triangle is debt free.
As previously announced, Triangle has undertaken a strategic review. The outcomes of the review and other 
corporate and shareholder items will be addressed at the company’s annual general meeting, expected to 
take place in November.
The next 12 months will be an exciting period for the company which will benefit from its new Australian 
focus. Triangle is in a strong financial position with a clear line of sight on future revenues which will enable 
it to invest in opportunities to progress the Company and build shareholder value.

WESTERN AUSTRALIAN OPERATIONS 
Cliff Head Oil Field (57.5%), Offshore Perth Basin
Triangle acquired 57.5% of the Cliff Head oil field, located in the 
offshore Western Australian permit WA-31-L, from AWE in June 
for  a  purchase  price  of  $3.2  million  in  addition  to  a  royalty  of 
US$5/bbl for oil sales in excess of US$70/bbl. ROC Oil (WA) Pty 
Ltd, a subsidiary of Fosun International Limited is the operator and 
holds a 42.5% interest.
Cliff  Head  is  located  ~300km  north  of  Perth  and  was  the  first 
commercial  offshore  Perth  Basin  discovery 
(2001)  and 
commenced  production  in  2006.  The  development  consisted  of 
the Cliff Head Alpha (CHA) unmanned platform and twin injection 
& production pipelines to the onshore Arrowsmith plant for a capex 
cost  of  US$327  million.  The  June  2016  quarter  average  oil 
production was 1,174 bbl/d. Remaining recoverable 2P reserves 
estimated at 3.8 mmboe as at 1 January 2016.
The  Cliff  Head  acquisition  represents  the  first  step  in  Triangle 
Energy’s  Perth  Basin  strategy  with  the  effective  date  of  the 
transaction  being  1  January  2016.  Cash  benefits  accrued  and 
payable to Triangle since the effective date to 30 June 2016 total 
$0.9 million including hedges and has been reconciled against the 
purchase price consideration via a completion adjustment.
Post  balance  date,  on  28  July  2016  Triangle  paid  the  final 
consideration amount of $0.7 million to AWE which represents a 
total cash payment of $2.3 million.

Cliff Head Abandonment Study
In  May  2015,  the  Cliff  Head  Joint  Venture 
undertook  an  abandonment  study.  Triangle’s 
net  share  of 
is 
estimated to be $28.3 million of the total figure.
the  abandonment  costs
In addition to the Cliff Head asset acquisition, 
Triangle  Energy  is  entitled  to  the  Petroleum 
Resource  Rent  Tax  (PRRT)  credits  being  in 
excess of $18 million. Positively, these PRRT 
credits  will  be  utilised  against  abandonment 
costs.  Triangle  estimate 
its  share  of 
abandonment cost, utilising its PRRT credits is 
in the range of $10-17 million. The Company is 
satisfied that future cash flows will adequately 
fund the abandonment liabilities.

after  the  Ministry  of  ESDM  or  SKK  MIGAS,  provides  written  approval  and  notification  of  the  Change  of 
Control of the PSC. This amount is held by Triangle under contract and has been reported as cash in the

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND EXPENDITURE 
As at 30 June 2016, Triangle Energy had cash of $1.8 million, compared to $3.6 million at the end of March 
2016. Expenditure consisted mostly of: 
•  $1.5 million for the acquisition of 57.5% of Cliff Head ($0.7 million balance of the consideration after
completion adjustments was paid on 28 July 2016);
•  $95k in salaries and director’s fees; 
•  $58k for consultant fees relating to the acquisition of Cliff Head;

•  $26k for reconciliation of cash calls for 2014-2016 in relation to the Reids Dome Joint Venture; and, 
•  $38k legal, compliance and other administration costs 
The year to date administrative costs reflect 7 months of having offices in Australia, Jakarta, and operations

costs are expected to rationalise significantly.
