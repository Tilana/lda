 <p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, in the communiqu&#233; 
</p>
<p>of its 190th meeting, of 22 May 2009, condemned the repeated attacks against the Government 
</p>
<p>and the civilian population in Mogadishu and other parts of Somalia, including by armed groups, 
</p>
<p>and foreign elements bent on undermining the peace and reconciliation process,   
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the outcome of the pledging conference held in Brussels, on 
</p>
<p>22 and 23 April 2009, as it constitutes a sign of renewed commitment by the international 
</p>
<p>community to support the long-term stabilization and paving the way for post-conflict 
</p>
<p>reconstruction of Somalia, as reflected in, inter alia, the declaration of the Council of the 
</p>
<p>European Union on 27 July 2009,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also</i> the role played by the International Contact Group on Somalia,<b>  
</b></p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the need for more coordination within the international community aimed at 
</p>
<p>socio-economic development and political stabilization of Somalia, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> that humanitarian, human rights and development assistance is of importance 
</p>
<p>to alleviate poverty and to promote a more peaceful, equitable and democratic society in 
</p>
<p>Somalia, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that the dire human rights and humanitarian situation in Somalia demands an 
</p>
<p>urgent and tangible national response with<b> </b>international support that is commensurate with its 
</p>
<p>gravity, and expressing support for the commitment of the Transitional Federal Government to 
</p>
<p>improve the respect of human rights and international humanitarian law by legal provisions, law 
</p>
<p>enforcement and activities to protect the civilian population,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the commitment made by the Transitional Federal Government to ensure 
</p>
<p>inclusiveness in the political process, as clearly shown by its constant endeavours to reach out to 
</p>
<p>those who have hitherto remained outside the peace process and to work towards a broad-based 
</p>
<p>political process on the premise of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also </i>the decision taken by the Transitional Federal Government<b> </b>to nominate a 
</p>
<p>human rights focal point with the objective of constituting a national human rights commission 
</p>
<p>focusing on the safeguarding of all human rights in Somalia; the provision in the new 
</p>
<p>Constitution of Puntland to create an independent human rights body; as well as subnational </p>

 <p>constitutions, such as those in Somaliland and Puntland, which are positive steps to enhance 
</p>
<p>human rights protection in the areas,  
</p>

</p>
<p>the central and southern regions of Somalia,

</p>
<p>peacekeepers of the African Union Mission to Somalia and the security forces of the 
</p>
<p>Transitional Federal Government on 17 September 2009, and conveying its deepest condolences 
</p>
<p>to the families of the victims and to the Governments of Uganda, Burundi and Somalia as well as 
</p>
<p>to the African Union, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> the continuing threat of piracy, which adversely affects the delivery of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian supplies, the safe passage of international maritime traffic and stressing the need to 
</p>
<p>tackle the root causes of the piracy symptom through a comprehensive approach for the 
</p>

</p>
<p>22 May 2009, as well as Assembly resolution of 3 July 2009 (AU/Dec.252/XIII, para. 16), and 
</p>
<p>invites other regional organizations of which Somalia is a Member State, as well as the

</p>
<p>and strengthen the human rights regime in its work to complete the outstanding task of the 
</p>
