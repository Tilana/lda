FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  Thursday, August 4, 2016
Adjusted non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter 2016 was $209.7 million, or $0.38 per share,
HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) today reported a second quarter 2016 net loss of $292.6 
 
million, or $0.53 per share. This compares to second quarter 2015 net income of $5.3 million, or $0.01 per 
share.  
 
compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $153.1 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same prior year 
period.  Adjusted non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated by matching hedge realizations to settlement 
months and making certain other adjustments in order to exclude non-recurring items.  For a 
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.
 
reductions, resulting in decreases in adjusted non-GAAP net income, discretionary cash flow and 
EBITDAX during the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015.  For a reconciliation of 
non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.
Lower commodity prices more than offset significant well productivity improvements and cost
In the second quarter 2016, EOG increased its inventory of net premium drilling locations from
Operational Highlights
 
3,200 to 4,300.  Premium inventory is defined by a direct after-tax rate of return hurdle rate of at least 30 
percent assuming $40 flat crude oil prices.  Total premium net resource potential increased from 2.0 
billion barrels of oil equivalent (BnBoe) to 3.5 BnBoe.  These additions were the result of advances in 
completion technology, precision targeting, longer laterals and cost reductions.  
 
exceeded the midpoint of the company’s guidance by 2 percent. Compared to the same prior year period, 
lease and well expenses decreased 23 percent, and transportation costs decreased 13 percent, both on a 
per-unit basis.  Total general and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent compared to the second 
quarter 2015, excluding expenses related to a voluntary retirement program.
U.S. crude oil volumes of 265,400 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) in the second quarter 2016
Exploration and development expenditures (excluding property acquisitions) decreased 49 percent,
while total crude oil production declined by only 4 percent, in the second quarter 2016 compared to the 
same period last year.  Total natural gas production for the second quarter 2016 decreased 5 percent versus 
the same prior year period.
“The benefits of EOG’s premium drilling strategy are beginning to show in our operating 
performance,” said William R. “Bill” Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  “We are 
committed to focusing capital on our premium assets which we are confident will increasingly lead to 
break-out performance as prices improve.  This quarter’s addition of 1.5 BnBoe of additional premium net 
resource potential further solidifies our ability to deliver premium returns over the long term.”
As a result of cost reductions and efficiency improvements, EOG has increased its targeted number
2016 Capital Plan Update and 2020 Crude Oil Production Outlook
 
of well completions for 2016 from 270 to 350 net wells.  Many of the additional well completions are 
scheduled for late 2016.  In addition, due to increased drilling productivity, the company expects to drill 
250 net wells, 50 more than in its original 2016 plans.  This increase in activity will be accomplished 
while maintaining 2016 capital expenditure guidance of $2.4 to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions.
EOG can achieve significant production growth with balanced cash flow from 2017 through 2020,
even in a moderate commodity price environment.  Based on EOG’s long-term plan and assuming a flat 
$50 West Texas Intermediate crude oil price (WTI), EOG would expect 10 percent compound annual 
crude oil production growth through 2020.  Assuming flat $60 WTI, EOG would expect 20 percent 
compound annual crude oil production growth through 2020.
“EOG’s long-term outlook reflects superior capital efficiency and continued capital discipline,
hallmarks of the company since its founding,” Thomas said.  “Our premium drilling strategy is the key to
our future success, and it is underpinned by EOG’s industry-leading asset quality, scale, technology, well 
performance and low-cost structure.  Most importantly, EOG’s high-performance culture prioritizes rates 
of return over other performance metrics.”
South Texas Eagle Ford
The South Texas Eagle Ford, EOG’s largest high-return play, continues to lead the company in
activity and production.  In the second quarter, EOG increased its Eagle Ford premium inventory by 390 
net drilling locations to almost 2,000 total.  This large inventory of high-quality locations could be 
expanded significantly should additional cost reductions or improvements in well productivity be 
achieved.  For example, EOG estimates that a 10 percent reduction in completed well costs or a 10 percent 
improvement in estimated recoverable reserves per well would more than double EOG’s premium 
inventory in the Eagle Ford.
In the second quarter, EOG completed 60 wells in the Eagle Ford with an average treated lateral 
length of 4,800 feet per well and an average 30-day initial production rate per well of 1,705 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day (Boed), or 1,340 Bopd, 175 barrels per day (Bpd) of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and 1.1 
million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas.
In the second quarter, EOG expanded its premium inventory in all three of its major Delaware
Delaware Basin
 
Basin formations - the Wolfcamp, the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard.  By organically adding more 
than 500 net premium drilling locations, EOG is well positioned for years of high-return growth in this 
world-class basin.  EOG continues to improve well economics in the Delaware Basin through advances in 
well and completion designs, including recent breakthroughs that enable higher productivity with longer 
laterals.  
In the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, EOG completed 16 wells in the second quarter with an average 
 
treated lateral length of 6,500 feet per well, a 44 percent increase in lateral length from the prior quarter.  
The average 30-day initial production rate per well was 2,410 Boed, or 1,610 Bopd, 340 Bpd of NGLs and 
2.8 MMcfd of natural gas.  In the Delaware Basin Second Bone Spring, EOG completed nine wells in the 
second quarter with an average treated lateral length of 4,500 feet per well and an average 30-day initial 
production rate per well of 1,500 Boed, or 1,120 Bopd, 155 Bpd of NGLs and 1.4 MMcfd of natural gas.
EOG is continuing to optimize its core Rockies and Bakken plays, adding 200 additional net
Rockies and the Bakken
 
premium drilling locations to its inventory in the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming.  The Codell is a liquids-
rich sandstone formation that now has significant premium potential due to cost reductions and 
efficiencies along with the application of EOG’s precision targeting and completion technology.
In the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming, EOG completed the Jubilee 541-3502H well in the second
quarter with average 30-day initial production rates of 1,190 Bopd, 130 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of 
natural gas.
In the Powder River Basin Turner, EOG completed the Arbalest 73-06H, 272-06H and 66-0607H 
wells on the same pad during the second quarter with average 30-day initial production rates per well of 
1,000 Bopd, 330 Bpd of NGLs and 3.8 MMcfd of natural gas.
In the North Dakota Bakken, EOG completed the Austin 421-2821H, 422-2821H and 423-2821H 
wells in a three-well pattern in the second quarter with average 30-day initial production rates per well of 
1,100 Bopd, 90 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of natural gas.  Also in the North Dakota Bakken, EOG 
completed the West Clark 103-0136H and 104-0136H wells in a two-well pattern with average 30-day 
initial production rates per well of 1,210 Bopd, 390 Bpd of NGLs and 1.8 MMcfd of natural gas.
In the Three Forks, EOG completed the West Clark 117-0136H well in the second quarter with
average 30-day initial production rates of 1,290 Bopd, 380 Bpd of NGLs and 1.8 MMcfd of natural gas.

For the period March 1 through August 31, 2016, EOG had natural gas financial price swap
contracts in place for 60,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day at a weighted average price of 
$2.49 per MMBtu.
For the period September 1 through November 30, 2016, EOG sold natural gas call option
contracts for 43,750 MMBtu per day at an average strike price of $3.45 per MMBtu.  For the period 
March 1 through November 30, 2017, EOG sold natural gas call option contracts for 43,750 MMBtu per 
day at an average strike price of $3.45 per MMBtu.  For the period March 1 through November 30, 2018, 
EOG sold natural gas call option contracts for 12,500 MMBtu per day at an average strike price of $3.32 
per MMBtu.
For the period March 1 through November 30, 2017, EOG purchased natural gas put option 
contracts for 35,000 MMBtu per day at an average strike price of $2.90 per MMBtu.  For the period 
March 1 through November 30, 2018, EOG purchased natural gas put option contracts for 10,000 MMBtu 
per day at an average strike price of $2.90 per MMBtu.
A comprehensive summary of natural gas derivative contracts is provided in the attached tables.
Capital Structure and Asset Sales
At June 30, 2016, EOG’s total debt outstanding was $7.0 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization 
 
ratio of 37 percent. Taking into account cash on the balance sheet of $780 million at the end of the second 
quarter, EOG’s net debt was $6.2 billion with a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 34 percent.  For a 
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.
Proceeds from asset sales this year to date total $425 million.  This includes proceeds from two
transactions that closed in the third quarter 2016.  The assets were divested in more than a dozen separate 
transactions of non-core natural gas and liquids-rich properties.  Associated production of the divested 
assets was 45 MMcfd of natural gas, 3,300 Bopd and 3,700 Bpd of NGLs.  Sales of additional non-core 
assets are in progress and anticipated to close in 2016.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the 
 
SEC, to disclose not only “proved” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable with a high degree 
of confidence), but also “probable” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not to be recovered) as well as 
“possible” reserves (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be recovered, but with a lower probability than probable 
reserves).  Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. 
Any reserve estimates provided in this press release that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may 
include "potential" reserves and/or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the 
SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines.  Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in EOG’s Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, available from EOG at P.O. Box 4362, Houston, Texas 77210-4362 (Attn:

Quantitative Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)
EOG RESOURCES, INC.
to Net Income (Loss) (GAAP)
(Unaudited; in thousands, except per share data)
The following chart adjusts the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 reported Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) to reflect actual net 
cash received from (payments for) settlements of commodity derivative contracts by eliminating the unrealized mark-to-market (gains) losses from these 
transactions, to eliminate the net losses on asset dispositions in 2015 and 2016, to eliminate the impact of the Texas margin tax rate reduction in 2015, to add 
back severance costs associated with EOG's North American operations in 2015, to eliminate the impact of the Trinidad tax settlement in 2016 and to add back 
certain voluntary retirement expense in 2016.  EOG believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts 
who adjust reported company earnings to match hedge realizations to production settlement months and make certain other adjustments to exclude non-recurring 
items.  EOG management uses this information for purposes of comparing its financial performance with the financial performance of other companies in the 
industry.

the Net Debt-to-Total Capitalization Ratio (Non-GAAP) to
Current and Long-Term Debt (GAAP) and Total Capitalization (GAAP)
(Unaudited; in millions, except ratio data)
The following chart reconciles Current and Long-Term Debt (GAAP) to Net Debt (Non-GAAP) and Total Capitalization (GAAP) 
to Total Capitalization (Non-GAAP), as used in the Net Debt-to-Total Capitalization ratio calculation.  A portion of the cash is 
associated with international subsidiaries; tax considerations may impact debt paydown.  EOG believes this presentation may 
be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who utilize Net Debt and Total Capitalization (Non-
GAAP) in their Net Debt-to-Total Capitalization ratio calculation.  EOG management uses this information for comparative 
purposes within the industry.

Direct After-Tax Rate of Return (ATROR)
The calculation of our direct after-tax rate of return (ATROR) with respect to our capital expenditure program for a particular 
play or well is based on the estimated proved reserves ("net" to EOG’s interest) for all wells in such play or such well (as the 
case may be), the estimated net present value (NPV) of the future net cash flows from such reserves (for which we utilize certain 
assumptions regarding future commodity prices and operating costs) and our direct net costs incurred in drilling or acquiring 
(as the case may be) such wells or well (as the case may be).  As such, our direct ATROR with respect to our capital expenditures 
for a particular play or well cannot be calculated from our consolidated financial statements.
Direct ATROR
Based on Cash Flow and Time Value of Money
  - Estimated future commodity prices and operating costs
  - Costs incurred to drill, complete and equip a well, including facilities
Excludes Indirect Capital
  - Gathering and Processing and other Midstream
  - Land, Seismic, Geological and Geophysical
Payback ~12 Months on 100% Direct ATROR Wells
First Five Years ~1/2 Estimated Ultimate Recovery Produced but ~3/4 of NPV Captured
Return on Equity / Return on Capital Employed
Based on GAAP Accrual Accounting
Includes All Indirect Capital and Growth Capital for Infrastructure
  - Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Facilities
  - Gathering and Processing
Includes Legacy Gas Capital and Capital from Mature Wells
