<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and  
the comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to

</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, recalling its resolution 1/5 of 30 June 2006, all resolutions 
of the General Assembly and of the Commission on Human Rights, in particular Assembly 
resolutions 57/195 of 18 December 2002 and 60/144 of 16 December 2005 and Commission 
resolution 2002/68 of 25 April 2002, on the subject, decides: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To heed the decision and instruction of the 2001 World Conference against 
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance by establishing an 
open-ended working group with the mandate to elaborate, as a matter of priority and necessity, 
complementary standards in the form of either a convention or additional protocol(s) to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, filling the 
existing gaps in the Convention and also providing new normative standards aimed at combating 
all forms of contemporary racism, including racial and religious incitement, and that the 
Working Group shall convene annual sessions of 10 working days and submit reports to the 
relevant successive sessions of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>GE.06-14442  (E)    041006 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To recommend to the General Assembly that it decide, at its sixty-first session, in 
compliance with its resolution 60/144 to convene a five-year review of the implementation of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action which would focus on the realities of present-day 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  To this end the Council also 
recommends that in the preparatory processes to the proposed review the Assembly should 
ensure that all States and regions demonstrate their resolve and determination to move 
significantly from rhetoric to reality in their actions against all the scourges of racism; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To implement, through a structured process, all the recommendations of the report 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/14) on a racial 
equality index and to apply this proposed tool as the only barometer, or score card, to assess the 
commitment of each State to combating racism; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to give 
visibility and a high profile to the Anti-Discrimination Unit within her Office and to provide it 
with all the necessary and additional resources to ensure its effectiveness, particularly in view of 
the current global challenges of racial and religious discrimination.  The Unit would ensure that 
the High Commissioner makes a positive contribution and place a leadership role in the global 
efforts to combat all the resurgent scourges of racism. 
</p>
<p>The Council also decides to recommend to the General Assembly the following draft decision 
for adoption:   
</p>
<p> &#8220;The General Assembly, taking note of decision 2006/&#8230; of &#8230; October 2006 of 
the Human Rights Council, in particular subparagraph (b) relating to the convening of a 
five-year review of the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, decides to endorse the decision of the Council.&#8221;
