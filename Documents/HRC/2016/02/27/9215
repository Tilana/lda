<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102 
of 6 October 2006, requesting the Secretary-General to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of [his] 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. The present update outlines the progress 
achieved on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity since the last report to the 
Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/87). 
</p>
<p> Reports of the Secretary-General on fundamental standards of humanity aim at outlining 
issues related to securing the practical protection of all individuals in all circumstances and by all 
actors. Further to the publication of the 2005 Customary International Humanitarian Law study 
prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the following developments 
since 2006, inter alia<i>, </i>have contributed to securing the practical respect for existing international 
human rights and humanitarian law standards in all circumstances and by all actors. The 
General Assembly adopted the Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law as well as the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance and opened it for signature, ratification and accession. 
The ongoing work of the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for 
Rwanda has elaborated on the nature and elements of certain war crimes, of genocide and of 
crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p> The work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Extraordinary Chambers in the 
Courts of Cambodia represent a step further into incorporating standards of humanity into the 
work of hybrid courts. The International Court of Justice, in its decision of 26 February 2007 in 
the case of the <i>Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)</i> provided further clarification as 
to the interpretation of the scope and of certain key notions of the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This decision further clarified the interpretation of the 
term &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; and its significance in international law within the scope of crimes 
against humanity, genocide and war crimes in the context of the responsibility to protect. Finally, 
the commencement of operations of the International Criminal Court also contributed to efforts 
to securing the protection of victims and achieving accountability for serious violations of 
international humanitarian and human rights law. 
</p>
<p> To build on this substantial progress, the Human Rights Council may wish to keep itself 
informed of relevant developments, including further international and regional case law, which 
contribute to the interpretation of existing standards. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102 
of 6 October 2006, requesting the Secretary-General to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of [his] 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. Previous decisions and resolutions of the 
Commission on Human Rights have requested the Secretary-General to submit analytical reports 
covering relevant developments on the issue of fundamental standards of humanity.<b>1</b> In this 
context, this report aims to cover relevant developments on the issue of fundamental standards of 
humanity, since the most recent analytical report of the Secretary-General, submitted to the 
Commission on Human Rights on 3 March 2006 (E/CN.4/2006/87). The comments and advice 
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the preparation of this report are 
gratefully acknowledged.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  OVERVIEW OF FUNDAMENTAL STANDARDS OF HUMANITY 
</b></p>
<p>2. The need to identify fundamental standards of humanity initially arose from the premise 
that most often situations of internal violence pose a particular threat to human dignity and 
freedom.<b>2</b> Previous reports<b>3</b> observed that, while there is no apparent need to develop new 
standards, there is a need to secure practical respect for existing international human rights and 
humanitarian law standards in all circumstances and by all actors. Progress already achieved in 
this regard is largely based on the increasingly recognized interplay between international human 
rights law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, international refugee law 
and other bodies of law that may be relevant. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period from 1998 to 2003, the following developments have contributed to the 
interpretation and application of the relevant standards: (a) ongoing work of the International 
Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; (b) ongoing work of regional human 
rights bodies and courts; (c) adoption by the Human Rights Committee of general comment 
No. 29 on article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); 
(d) adoption by the International Law Commission of the draft articles on State Responsibility 
for Internationally Wrongful Acts; and (e) increased ratification by States of key international 
human rights law and international humanitarian instruments. Furthermore, agreements

</p>
<p>concluded at the country level between humanitarian agencies and both States and non-State 
entities illustrate the importance of promoting fundamental principles of human rights and 
international humanitarian law on the ground. 
</p>
<p>4. In his last report on fundamental standards of humanity to the Commission on Human 
Rights, the Secretary-General identified the following developments from 2004 to 2005 as 
contributing to the interpretation and application of existing standards: (a) the Customary 
International Humanitarian Law study prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross 
which, inter alia, significantly contributed to clarifying those international humanitarian law 
rules applicable in non-international armed conflict; (b) adoption by the Human Rights 
Committee of general comment No. 31 on article 2 of the ICCPR; and (c) the International Court 
of Justice&#8217;s Advisory Opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory</i> and its judgement in the <i>Case Concerning Armed Activities on 
the Territory of the Congo</i>, which reaffirmed the applicability of international human rights law 
during armed conflict and addressed the relationship between international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report focuses on the most recent developments that contributed to 
securing the practical respect of existing standards in all circumstances and by all actors 
through the ongoing work of international courts and tribunals, particularly in the light of the 
publication of the Customary International Humanitarian Law Study. The case law of the 
International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda elaborated on the 
nature and elements of certain war crimes, of genocide and of crimes against humanity. The 
work of the Special Court for Sierra Leone has further reinforced the elaboration of elements of 
crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is to be expected that the Extraordinary Chambers in 
the Courts of Cambodia will continue enriching the development of these crimes. The decision 
of the International Court of Justice in the case of the <i>Application of the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia 
and Montenegro)</i> provided further clarification as to the interpretation of the scope and of 
certain key notions of the Genocide Convention. The commencement of operations of the 
International Criminal Court also contributed to the process of securing protection of victims 
and combating impunity for violations of international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law. The report also notes the analysis provided by the International Court of 
Justice of the meaning of the term &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; and its significance in international law in 
the context of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes and within the purview of the 
responsibility to protect. The report also highlights the adoption by the General Assembly of 
the Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations 
of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian 
Law and of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. Finally, the report recalls the principle adopted by the Human Rights 
Committee in its general comment No. 32 (2007) on the right to equality before courts and 
tribunals and to a fair trial, which includes the prohibition at all times of deviating from 
principles of fair trial. </p>

<p><b>II.  RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International courts and tribunals 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
</b></p>
<p>6. Some recent rulings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 
(ICTY) contribute in important ways to the interpretation and application of certain rules 
identified in the Customary International Humanitarian Law Study, as well as to the 
development of international humanitarian law and international criminal law more generally. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) War crimes 
</b>7. In <i>The Prosecutor v. Stanislav Gali</i>&#263; (hereafter <i>Gali</i>&#263;),<b>4</b> the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY 
elaborated on the nature of the crime of &#8220;acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which 
is to spread terror among the civilian population&#8221;. The Customary International Humanitarian 
Law study identified this behaviour, as contained in article 51 (2) of Additional Protocol I and 
article 13 (2) of Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, as a norm 
of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>8. The Appeals Chamber in <i>Gali</i>&#263; recalled that the judgement only envisages such crime as 
encompassing the intent to spread terror when committed by combatants in a period of armed 
conflict and does not envisage any other form of terror. The Appeals Chamber stated that 
articles 51 (2) of Additional Protocol I and 13 (2) of Additional Protocol II &#8220;do not contain new 
principles but rather codify in a unified manner the prohibition of attacks on the civilian 
population&#8221;.<b>5</b> The Appeals Chamber added that the principles underlying the prohibition of 
attacks on civilians, namely the principles of distinction and proportionality &#8220;incontrovertibly 
form the basic foundation of international humanitarian law and constitute &#8216;intransgressible 
principles of international customary law&#8217; &#8221;.<b>6</b> In this sense, the Appeals Chamber considered 
that, &#8220;at a minimum, articles 51 (1), (2) and (3) of Additional Protocol I and article 13 of 
Additional Protocol II in its entirety constituted an affirmation of existing customary 
international law at the time of their adoption&#8221;.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>9. The Appeals Chamber in <i>Gali</i>&#263; further elaborated on the material element of the crime of 
acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian 
population, stating that it can comprise attacks or threats of attacks against the civilian 
</p>

</p>
<p>population, including indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks or threats thereof. The actual 
inflicting of terror on the civilian population is not a required element of this crime. Further, 
confirming the decision of the Trial Chamber, the Appeals Chamber noted that the mental 
element of the crime &#8220;is composed of the specific intent to spread terror among the civilian 
population&#8221;.<b>8</b> The Appeals Chamber found that: &#8220;a plain reading of article 51 (2) suggests that 
the purpose of the unlawful acts or threats to commit such unlawful acts need not be the only 
purpose of the acts or threats of violence. The fact that other purposes may have coexisted 
simultaneously with the purpose of spreading terror among the civilian population would not 
disprove this charge, provided that the intent to spread terror among the civilian population was 
principal among the aims&#8221;.<b>9</b> Such intent can be inferred from the circumstances of the acts or 
threats, that is, from their nature, manner, timing and duration.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Genocide 
</b>10. The Appeals Chamber in <i>The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakic<b></b></i><b>11</b> (hereafter <i>Stakic</i>) dealt, 
inter alia<i>,</i> with elements of the crime of genocide. The Appeals Chamber reaffirmed the Trial 
Chamber&#8217;s conclusion that, based on the etymology of the term &#8220;genocide&#8221;, the drafting history 
of the Genocide Convention, subsequent discussion by experts and article 4 of the Statute of the 
ICTY, the target group must be positively defined. Thus, the elements of genocide must be 
separately considered in relation to Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Crimes against humanity 
</b>11. In <i>Stakic</i>, the Appeals Chamber outlined the <i>actus reus </i>and the <i>mens rea </i>requirements 
for deportation as a crime against humanity, consistent with the jurisprudence of the ICTY 
to date.<b>12</b> The Appeals Chamber surveyed relevant international law and authority and 
concluded that the <i>actus reus</i> of deportation as a crime against humanity consists of the forced 
displacement of persons by expulsion or other forms of coercion from the area in which they are 
lawfully present, and requires that individuals be transferred across a de jure State border.<b>13</b> In 
certain circumstances, the crime of deportation can consist of transfers across de facto borders, 
provided there is support for such under customary international law. The Appeals Chamber 
held that constantly changing frontlines do not amount to de facto borders under customary 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>international law. As such, deportations across constantly changing frontlines are insufficient 
under customary international law to ground a conviction for deportation.<b>14</b> Further, following 
a review of ICTY jurisprudence and of relevant legal instruments, including article 49 of 
the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war, of 
12 August 1949, the Appeals Chamber considered that the <i>mens rea </i>of the offence does not 
require an intent that the deportees should not return.<b>15</b> The Appeals Chamber added that the 
participation of an NGO in facilitating displacements does not in and of itself render an 
otherwise unlawful transfer lawful.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Nevertheless, the Appeals Chamber in <i>Staki</i>&#263; concluded that &#8220;individuals who are 
displaced within the boundaries of the State or across de facto borders not within the definition 
of deportation remain protected by the law. Punishment for such forcible transfers may be 
assured by the adoption of proper pleading practices in the Prosecution&#8217;s indictments - it need 
not challenge existing concepts of international law&#8221;.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Individual criminal responsibility 
</b>13. In <i>Stakic, </i>the Appeals Chamber reviewed the Trial Chamber&#8217;s application of 
&#8220;co-perpetratorship&#8221;,<b>18</b> rather than joint criminal enterprise, as a mode of liability of the 
accused. The Appeals Chamber held that such a mode of liability is new to the jurisprudence of 
the Tribunal, and the question of whether it is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is an issue 
of general importance warranting the scrutiny of the Appeals Chamber, <i>proprio motu. </i>The 
Appeals Chamber thus intervened to assess whether the mode of liability applied by the Trial 
Chamber is consistent with the jurisprudence of the Tribunal. The Appeals Chamber found that 
the Trial Chamber erred in conducting its analysis of the responsibility of the appellant within 
the framework of &#8220;co-perpetratorship&#8221;, and stated that &#8220;this mode of liability, as defined and 
applied by the Trial Chamber, does not have support in customary international law, or in the 
settled jurisprudence of the Tribunal&#8221;.<b>19</b> Thus, the Appeals Chamber then applied the correct 
legal framework - that of joint criminal enterprise - and held that the factual findings of the Trial 
Chamber support liability of the accused pursuant to the first and third categories of joint 
criminal enterprise.

</p>
<p><b>(e) Command responsibility 
</b>14. In <i>The Prosecutor v. Enver Hadzihasanovic</i> (hereafter <i>Hadzihasanovic</i>),<b>20</b> the Appeals 
Chamber of the ICTY analysed the different component of the notion of command 
responsibility. The Appeals Chamber recalled that a commander&#8217;s de jure power creates a 
presumption of effective control. However, the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond 
reasonable doubt that the accused had effective control over his subordinates. 
</p>
<p>15. The Appeals Chamber further discussed in <i>Hadzihasanovic</i> the scope of the &#8220;had reason to 
know&#8221; standard and indicated that the commander&#8217;s responsibility would be engaged if he fails 
to act in spite of the fact that he possessed sufficiently alarming information about possible 
violations. The Chamber indicates that &#8220;while the superior&#8217;s knowledge of and failure to punish 
his subordinates past offences is insufficient, in itself, to conclude that the superior know that 
similar offences would be committed by the same group of insubordinates, this may &#8230; 
nevertheless constitute sufficiently alarming information to justify further inquiry&#8221;.<b>21</b> Thus, the 
Appeals Chamber interpreted the &#8220;reason to know&#8221; standard as requiring an assessment of 
whether a superior had sufficiently alarming information that would have alerted him of the risk 
that crimes might be committed by his subordinates. 
</p>
<p>16. Concerning the causality link in evaluating command responsibility, the Appeals 
Chamber in <i>Hadzihasanovic</i> made it clear that the determination of a causal link between a 
commander&#8217;s failure to act and his subordinate&#8217;s crimes was unnecessary to a finding of superior 
responsibility. The Chamber recalled the Trial Chamber&#8217;s conclusion in <i>The Prosecutor v. 
Sefer Halilovic </i>(hereafter <i>Halilovic) </i>that &#8220;if a causal link were required, this would change the 
basis of command responsibility for failure to prevent or punish to the extent that it would 
practically require involvement on the part of the commander in the crime his subordinates 
committed&#8221;.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>17. The Appeals Chamber in <i>Halilovic</i> also discussed the superior&#8217;s &#8220;duty to prevent&#8221; and 
indicated that the general duty of commanders to take the necessary and reasonable measures is 
well rooted in customary international law and stems from their position of authority. The 
Appeals Chamber stated that the &#8220;necessary&#8221; measures are the measures appropriate for the 
superior to discharge his obligation (showing that he genuinely tried to prevent or punish) and 
&#8220;reasonable&#8221; measures are those reasonably falling within the material powers of the superior.<b>23</b> 
Thus, the standard is whether the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures 
to prevent the criminal act or punish the perpetrator thereof.<b>24</b>

</p>
<p><b>(f) Transfer to national courts 
</b>18. On 17 May 2005, the ICTY transferred the case of Radovan Stankovic to the War 
Crimes Chamber of the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Stankovic was the first ICTY 
indictee whose case was transferred to a national court as part of the Tribunal&#8217;s completion 
strategy under rule 11 bis of its Rules of Procedure and Evidence. On 14 November 2006, the 
War Crimes Chamber sentenced Radovan Stankovic to 16 years&#8217; imprisonment for crimes 
against humanity, including rape, in violation of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
On 22 July 2005, the ICTY also transferred the case of Gojko Jankovic to the Bosnian courts. 
On 16 February 2007, the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found the accused guilty of crimes 
against humanity and sentenced him to 34 years&#8217; imprisonment. On 12 April 2006, the ICTY 
transferred Pa&#353;ko Ljubi&#269;i&#263; to Bosnian courts. On 29 April 2008, following the acceptance of a 
plea agreement by the Bosnian Prosecutor&#8217;s office, the Court found Pa&#353;ko Ljubi&#269;i&#263; guilty of war 
crimes against civilians and sentenced him to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment. Finally, 
on 4 September 2006, the ICTY Appeals Chamber confirmed the referral of Savo Todovi&#263; to 
the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 28 February 2008, the Bosnian Trial Panel found 
Savo Todovi&#263; guilty of crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to twelve and a half years&#8217; 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the case of <i>The Prosecutor v. Tharcisse Muvunyi</i>, the Trial Chamber of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) elaborated on the various forms of participation in or 
contribution to the commission of a crime by others, pursuant to article 6 (1) of the Statute of the 
ICTR, consistent with ICTR jurisprudence.<b>25</b> The Trial Chamber further reaffirmed the reasoning 
in <i>Akayesu</i> regarding the constituent elements of the crime of genocide.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>20. Further, the Trial Chamber in <i>Muvunyi</i> considered the requisite elements of rape as a crime 
against humanity by making reference to the &#8220;chequered history of the definition of rape&#8221; in the 
jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals. The Trial Chamber concluded that previous decisions 
were not incompatible and reflected the &#8220;objective of protecting individual sexual autonomy&#8221;.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  International Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>21. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its decision of 26 February 2007 concerning the 
<i>Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)</i>, provided further clarification concerning

<p>jurisprudence, further clarified the interpretation of certain key notions of the Genocide 
Convention. This was the first case at the ICJ in which a State (Bosnia and Herzegovina) brought 
proceedings against another (Serbia and Montenegro) for the commission of genocide. 
</p>
<p>22.  In its decision, the ICJ recalled, inter alia, that the commission of genocide requires a 
<i>dolus specialis</i>, or specific intent, that differentiates it from other crimes such as crimes against 
humanity.<b>28</b> This argument is in line with a similar approach proposed by the ICTY argument in 
the <i>Kupreskic et al.</i> case.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Further, following the ICTY&#8217;s reasoning in <i>Stakic</i>, the ICJ concluded that, in relationship 
to the genocide, the target group must be defined positively according to specific distinguishing 
well-established characteristics. 
</p>
<p>24. The Court also referred to the notion of ethnic cleansing, which it defined as &#8220;rendering an 
area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups 
from the area&#8221;.<b>30</b> The Court indicated that ethnic cleansing can be a form of genocide only 
insofar as it falls within one of the categories of acts of genocide. Acts of ethnic cleansing would 
also need to fulfil the requirement of specific intent (<i>dolus specialis</i>) of genocide to be 
considered as such. The Court further indicated its view that &#8220;the term &#8216;ethnic cleansing&#8217; has no 
legal significance of its own&#8221;.<b>31</b> This conclusion clarifies the meaning of the term ethnic 
cleansing and its subordination to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>25. Certain developments at the International Criminal Court (ICC) have also contributed to 
the process of enforcement of international humanitarian law and human rights law, with the aim 
of combating impunity and ensuring accountability. In October 2005, the Office of the 
Prosecutor unsealed five arrest warrants in the context of its investigation of alleged crimes 
committed in Uganda against five of the most senior commanders of the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
(LRA), charging them with crimes against humanity and war crimes (including enslavement and 
murder). 
</p>
<p>26. The Office of the Prosecutor also issued an arrest warrant on 10 February 2006 against 
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, alleged leader of the Union des patriotes congolais, a non-State armed 
group operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He is charged with the war crimes of

<p>conscripting and enlisting children under the age of 15 as soldiers, and using them to participate 
actively in hostilities. He was arrested on 17 March 2006, and was subsequently transferred to 
The Hague. The confirmation of charges hearing ended at the end of November 2006. If this case 
reaches trial, it is likely to be the first to be heard at the ICC, and could contribute to efforts to 
protecting the rights of children and combating impunity for serious violations of international 
humanitarian and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>27. Also concerning the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on 6 July 2007 the 
Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against Germain Katanga, believed to be the leader of the 
Front des nationalistes et int&#233;grationnistes. Mr. Katanga, who was detained at the Centre 
p&#233;nitentiaire et de r&#233;&#233;ducation de Kinshasa, was transferred to The Hague on 18 October 2007. 
The case is currently under proceedings in the Pre-Trial Chamber. 
</p>
<p>28. In the context of the investigation of the situation in Darfur, on 27 April 2007 the Office of 
the Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against Ahmad Muhammad Harun, Minister of State for 
the Interior of the Government of the Sudan, and Ali Muhammad Al Abd-Al-Rahman, allegedly 
a senior leader in the tribal hierarchy in the Wadi Salih locality and a member of the Popular 
Defence Force (PDF) commanding thousands of Janjaweed militias, for the commission of war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Application of standards of humanity by special courts 
</b></p>
<p>29. The practice of special tribunals, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the 
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of Crimes Committed 
during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea have contributed to reinforcing the application of 
standards of humanity in the legal practice of national or hybrid type of jurisdictions. 
30. Trial Chamber I of the Special Court for Sierra Leone reaffirmed in its decision on the 
<i>CDF </i>case, inter alia, the role of customary international humanitarian law in the context of 
internal armed conflict, indicating that current legal developments lead to the conclusion that 
violations to common article 3 to the Geneva Conventions are crimes prohibited in all conflicts, 
international and internal.<b>32</b> In the <i>AFRC </i>case, Trial Chamber II further analysed the elements of 
crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Statute of the Special Court.<b>33</b> The Court&#8217;s 
decisions on the <i>RUF </i>case and the <i>Taylor </i>case could provide further analysis into the application 
of customary international humanitarian norms in situations of internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>31. Concerning the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, the enacting 
legislation included the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 
Geneva conventions as core crimes in the jurisdiction of the Chambers. Up to this date, five 
high-ranking suspects, including Kaing Guek Eav (alias Duch), have been detained and are 
awaiting trial. These trials could contribute to end impunity and to attribute responsibility for the 
grave violations committed in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.

<p><b>B.  World Summit Outcome 
</b></p>
<p>32. In late 2005 in the context of asserting the responsibility to protect, the World Summit 
added &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; alongside the more legally defined categories of war crimes, crimes 
against humanity and genocide. Paragraphs 138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome 
Document read as follows: 
</p>
<p>Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war 
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the 
prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary 
means [&#8230;]. The international community, through the United Nations, also has the 
responsibility [&#8230;] to help to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic 
cleansing and crimes against humanity.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Further, Security Council resolution 1674 (2006) of 28 April 2006 on the protection of 
civilians in armed conflict reaffirmed &#8220;the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 
World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from 
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity&#8221;.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>34. As indicated above,<b>36</b> the ICJ, in its decision of the <i>Application of the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and 
Montenegro)</i> indicated the strong relationship and subordination of the term ethnic cleansing to 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The ICTY has also addressed the notion of 
&#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;. In <i>The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakic</i>, the Appeals Chamber referred to 
Security Council resolution 827 (1993) which established the tribunal and which expressed its 
grave alarm at the continuance of the practice of &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; in all its forms. In 
considering the extent to which the Security Council&#8217;s purpose may be taken into account, the 
Appeals Chamber noted that: 
</p>
<p>The general position is of course that the Tribunal &#8220;can only act on the basis of law ... A 
Court functioning as a court of law can act in no other way&#8221;. &#8220;Ethnic cleansing&#8221; refers to a 
policy. This is not a crime in its own right under customary international law, but the 
general purpose which it represents can help to draw inferences as to the existence of 
elements of crimes referred to in the Statute. It is not correct to proceed on the basis that 
such limited use amounts to the use of policy as a self-sufficient ground of judicial 
action.<b>37</b>

<p><b>C. Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims  
of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious  
Violations of International Humanitarian Law 
</b></p>
<p>35. On 15 December 2005, the General Assembly adopted without a vote resolution 60/147, 
the annex to which contained the Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation 
for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations 
of International Humanitarian Law. The General Assembly emphasized in the preambular 
part of the resolution that the Basic Principles and Guidelines &#8220;do not entail new international 
or domestic legal obligations but identify mechanisms, modalities, procedures and methods 
for the implementation of existing legal obligations under international human rights 
law and international humanitarian law which are complementary though different as to 
their norms&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>D. International Convention for the Protection of  
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>36. On 20 December 2006, the General Assembly adopted without a vote resolution 61/177 
and opened for signature, ratification and accession the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The fifth preambular paragraph of the 
convention notes the awareness of the State parties &#8220;of the extreme seriousness of enforced 
disappearance, which constitutes a crime and, in certain circumstances defined in international 
law, a crime against humanity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  General comment No. 32 of the Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p>37. On 23 August 2007, the Human Rights Committee adopted general comment No. 32 on 
the interpretation of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
Committee reiterated, as it had previously done in paragraph 11 of its general comment No. 29 
(2001), that any deviation from fundamental principles of the right to fair trial, including the 
presumption of innocence, was prohibited at all times. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>Previous reports on fundamental standards of humanity observed that, while there 
was no apparent need to develop new standards, there was a need to secure respect for 
existing rules of international law aimed at ensuring the protection of persons in all 
circumstances and by all actors. 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>The recent work of international courts and tribunals and of special courts 
contributed to the interpretation of existing standards identified in the ICRC&#8217;s 
Customary International Humanitarian Law Study, and further elaborated on the 
elements and application of certain crimes. The General Assembly adopted the Basic </b></p>

International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian 
Law as well as the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>To build on this substantial progress, the Human Rights Council may wish to keep 
itself informed of relevant developments, including further international and regional case 
law, which contribute to the process of securing the practical protection of all individuals in 
all circumstances and by all actors.
