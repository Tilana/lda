TRANSCRIPT OF ORAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

The appellants were each convicted on (among other offences) a count of wrongful confinement under s256 of the Penal Code. On appeal to the High Court the Judge found the charge of wrongful confinement to be defective, as it failed to specify the mens rea element of the offence. The Judge substituted convictions for the lesser offence of wrongful confinement under s256.

The appellants have been granted an extension of time for appealing, and seek to appeal the convictions.

The background and issues are dealt with in greater detail in another judgment delivered today, Jonetani Sareka v the State. Counsel for the State accepts that the convictions should be quashed.

In respect of the other convictions arising from the same events the appellants did not submit the court should amend the sentences. Those sentences will stand.

Result
In respect of each appellant -

Appeal allowed; order quashing conviction and sentence for wrongful confinement under s256 of the Penal Code.
