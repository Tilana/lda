Review of Operations 
During  the  last  6  months,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Resource  Capital  Limited  (“RCA”) 
pursuant to which RCA agreed to provide $1 million of funding to the Company in two tranches in exchange for
the issue of 1 million convertible notes to RCA and independent clients of RCA.   
 
On  24  February  2016,  the  Company  received  the  first  tranche  of  $500,000  and  subsequently  issued  500,000 
convertible  notes  to  various  sophisticated  investor  clients  of  RCA.    At  the  Company’s  Extraordinary  General 
Meeting  on  18  March  2016,  the  Company  approved  the  conversion  of  the  first  tranche  convertible  notes  and
share issues to AEP Administrative Services Pty Ltd for past services and certain Directors for accrued director
fees.  
 
During the period, the Company has considered various energy, resources and infrastructure related assets in the 
USA in line with its strategy to inject new assets into the Company.  The Company is pursuing and conducting 
due diligence on a number of assets and opportunities and will make a determination at the completion of that
process followed by an update to the market at that time.  
 
The Company has also continued to maintain its 25% interest in Island Sky Corporation and is working with the 
company to maximise the potential and value of the business and crystallise the associated value of its holding in
the company.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE HALF-YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 1: BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
These general purpose financial statements for the interim half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2016 have 
been  prepared  in  accordance  with  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  Australian  Accounting 
Standard AASB 134: Interim Financial Reporting.  Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that 
the financial statements and notes also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
This interim financial report is intended to provide users with an update on the latest annual financial statements 
of  Pawnee  Energy  Limited.    As  such,  it  does  not  contain  information  that  represents  relatively  insignificant 
changes  occurring  during  the  half-year.    It  is  therefore  recommended  that  this  financial  report  be  read  in 
conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, together with any public 
announcements made during the half-year. 
 
The interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the 
last annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
 
The interim financial statements have been approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 30 
August 2016.

NOTE 6: OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 
Following  the  disposal  of  the  company’s  operating  subsidiary  Island  Sky  Corporation  (based  in  the  USA),  the 
directors are of the view that there is no longer distinguishable operating segments which require disclosure. 
 
NOTE 7: EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO REPORTING DATE 
 
With respect to the second tranche, the Company has also to date received funds pursuant to the agreement with 
RCA and expects to receive the remainder over the coming weeks once its deals are in place.  
 
The funding received from RCA has been used to pay down existing creditors and to seek new opportunities to 
acquire suitable energy, resources and infrastructure related assets in the USA and elsewhere.    
 
Other than as noted above, there were no events that have occurred subsequent to the financial statement that 
would materially affect the financial report.

Pawnee Energy Limited 
ABN 73 122 948 805 
  
NOTE 8: GOING CONCERN BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
 
The financial report has been prepared on the basis of going concern. 
 
The Company incurred a loss of $219,320 during the half-year ended 30 June 2016, a cash outflow of $191,520 
from operating activities and had net liabilities of $171,248. 
 
The Company remains reliant upon the continued financial support of the directors for the provision of working 
capital through interest free loans, the collection of the amount receivable from the sale of its subsidiary and/or 
additional further capital raisings to continue as a going concern.  We understand that once a suitable business is 
found to be acquired the company will seek to raise the additional capital required through a disclosure document 
 
If the continued financial support of the directors is not forthcoming, the collection of the proceeds from the sales 
of Island Sky Corporation is not recovered and/or additional funds are not raised, the going concern basis may not 
be appropriate, with the result that the Company may have to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities, other 
than in the ordinary course of business and in amounts different from those stated in the Interim Financial Report. 
No allowance for such circumstances has been made in the Interim Financial Report. 
 
NOTE 9: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
 
There has been no change in contingent liabilities since the last reporting date.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF PAWNEE ENERGY LIMITED
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report  
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Pawnee Energy Limited, which 
comprises the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, and the statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash 
flows for the half-year ended on that date, a statement of accounting policies, other selected 
explanatory notes, and the directors’ declaration.
Directors responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report  
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the 
half-year financial report in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation and fair presentation of the half-year financial report that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility  
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our 
review.  We conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review 
Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, 
in order to state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, anything has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the financial report is not presented fairly, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 
2001.  As the auditor of Pawnee Energy Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the 
ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.
Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd ACN 130 913 594 
a subsidiary or related entity of Grant Thornton Australia Ltd ABN 41 127 556 389 
 
‘Grant Thornton’ refers to the brand under which the Grant Thornton member firms provide assurance, tax and advisory services to their clients and/or refers to one or more member firms, as the context 
requires. Grant Thornton Australia Ltd is a member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd (GTIL). GTIL and the member firms are not a worldwide partnership. GTIL and each member firm is a separate legal 
entity. Services are delivered by the member firms. GTIL does not provide services to clients. GTIL and its member firms are not agents of, and do not obligate one another and are not liable for one another’s 
acts or omissions. In the Australian context only, the use of the term ‘Grant Thornton’ may refer to Grant Thornton Australia Limited ABN 41 127 556 389 and its Australian subsidiaries and related entities. 
GTIL is not an Australian related entity to Grant Thornton Australia Limited. 
 
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation. Liability is limited in those States where a current scheme 
applies.
2
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures.  A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence  
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Australian professional accounting bodies.
Material uncertainty regarding going concern 
Without modification to the conclusion expressed above, we draw attention to Note 8 to the 
half-year financial statements which indicates that the Company incurred a net loss of $219,320, 
a cash outflow of $191,520 from operating activities and had net liabilities of $171,248.
Should the continuing financial support of the Directors not be forthcoming, the collection of 
the proceeds from the sale of Island Sky Corporation is not recovered, and/or additional funds 
are not raised, these conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 8 indicate the 
existence of material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern and therefore the Company may be unable to realise its assets and 
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business at the amounts stated in the half-year 
financial report.
Conclusion  
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes 
us believe that the half-year financial report of Pawnee Energy Limited is not in accordance with 
the Corporations Act 2001, including:
a
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s  Company’s financial position as at 
30 June 2016 and of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and 
b  complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and
Corporations Regulations 2001.
