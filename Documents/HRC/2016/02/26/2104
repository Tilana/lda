Political Rights (ratified 1969), including its first Optional Protocol (2011); the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1969); the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1967); the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1985), 
including the Optional Protocol thereto (2008); the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1988), including the Optional 
Protocol thereto (2011); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1992), including its 
Optional Protocols on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography (2003 and 2002, respectively); the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008), including the Optional 
Protocol thereto (2008); and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance (2011).  
20. Tunisia has also acceded to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1957) 
and its Protocol (1968), and ratified the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and its two protocols: the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the Protocol against the 
Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (2003).  
21. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that Tunisia is not yet party to the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the 
abolition of the death penalty; the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. Moreover, Tunisia has not yet signed 
and ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families.

<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
examines the human rights of migrants who find themselves at border crossings in Tunisia. 
During his mission, the Special Rapporteur held consultations with Tunisian government 
officials as well as with migrants themselves, including some who had attempted to cross 
irregularly to Europe by sea. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur recognizes that Tunisia is in a period of transition, and has 
recently experienced unusual migration flows both into and out of the country in the 
context of the Arab Spring. Nevertheless, he notes a significant gap with regard to laws and 
policies concerning migration, and laments certain discriminatory aspects of laws against 
migrants, including the criminalization of irregular border crossings, and unclear practices 
regarding detention of migrants.   
</p>
<p> As regards the relationship with the European Union, he is hopeful that the 
negotiation of the new migration and mobility partnership will be an opportunity for the 
European Union and Tunisia to engage on the issue of migration border management in a 
way that focuses on the respect, protection and promotion of the human rights of migrants.

<p> I. Introduction .............................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="5">See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:<footnote name="2">7. On 23 October 2011, the NCA was elected and charged with drafting and adopting a 
new constitution for Tunisia. Assembly members have established six permanent 
committees, each responsible for drafting articles under specific chapters. In August 2012, 
the NCA released a compilation of the work by the committees. The compilation is being 
reviewed by the Coordination Committee of the Assembly, which is tasked with providing 
recommendations to each committee but is not authorized to change the content of the text. 
The process of revising the existing articles into one cohesive constitution is expected to be 
finalized in February 2013 and the NCA will likely consider the complete draft of the 
constitution in March 2013. The consolidated draft must then be discussed by the full 
Assembly, and subsequently approved, article by article, by an absolute majority of the 
Assembly &#8211; 109 out of 217 members. The Assembly must then approve the entire draft in a 
separate vote by a two-thirds majority. If the text is not approved, the NCA will consider a 
revised text. If a final draft is not adopted during that session, a referendum will be 
scheduled, with a simple majority required for adoption. 
28. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that a considerable number of the draft 
articles are aimed at guaranteeing basic human rights for all persons, making no distinction 
between citizens and other persons found within the Tunisian territory. Significantly, these 
include the rights of all persons to life (art. 2.1), physical and moral integrity (art. 1.<footnote name="5">1. Following the launching of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, established in 
Barcelona in November 1995, Tunisia was the first country to sign an Association 
Agreement with Europe. The Agreement, which entered into force in 1998, still constitutes 
the legal basis for European Union&#8211;Tunisian relations; current cooperation between Tunisia 
and the European Union has since been reconstituted within the framework of the Union for 
the Mediterranean. A first action plan, for the period 2005&#8211;<footnote name="2">2. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that Tunisia ratified the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture in 2011. In particular he notes the importance of 
establishing, in accordance with the Optional Protocol, a national preventive mechanism.

rights of migrants deprived of their liberty. The mechanism should be fully independent, </footnote>010, was established between

<p> III. Normative and institutional framework on migration .............................................  19&#8211;<footnote name="4">7. The Tunisian Coast Guard works in close collaboration with European Union 
countries, in particular Italy, in carrying out search and rescue operations at sea. Tunisia, 
like its European counterparts Italy and Malta, has ratified the International Convention on 
Maritime Search and Rescue, which provides for coordination and cooperation of such 
operations. However, one example highlights the complexity of search and rescue missions 
in the Mediterranean. During his visit the Special Rapporteur was informed of an operation 
carried out just days before, where the Coast Guard rescued a boat in distress in the 
Mediterranean that had over 60 persons on board, many of them Somalis, including women 
and children. In this case, the Special Rapporteur was informed that despite the fact that the 
boat in distress was much closer to European land territories, the Tunisian Coast Guard was 
requested by the Italian counterparts to rescue the sinking ship, and brought the rescued 
passengers safely to Tunisia, where they were received at the Choucha refugee camp. At 
the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, they were awaiting processing. Many of these 
persons may in fact have valid refugee claims. However, due to the lack of a coherent 
asylum system in Tunisia, coupled with the fact that resettlement of Somali refugees 
remains a challenge for UNHCR in Tunisia, there is a likelihood that these persons may 
become stranded in Tunisia, thus increasing their vulnerability and the likelihood that they 
may attempt another dangerous sea journey. In this context it is, of course, important to 
observe that resettlement should not be considered the only available solution to refugees </footnote>5 6

<p>  B. National legal framework ...............................................................................  25&#8211;<footnote name="3">6. It is also worth noting that presently, Tunisia does not have a comprehensive asylum 
law. However a draft law on asylum is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Justice 
with the support of UNHCR.  </footnote>7 7 
</p>
<p>  C. Institutional and policy framework .................................................................  38&#8211;<footnote name="4">6. The Special Rapporteur has learned that border management remains the key 
responsibility of the gendarmerie and the Coast Guard. At a meeting with representatives of 
the Coast Guard in both the Port of La Goulette and the Port of Zarzis, the Special 
Rapporteur was pleased to learn that their key priority remains the saving of lives. Search 
and rescue operations, which are led by the Coast Guard, result in the concrete outcome of 
saving lives and are commended by the Special Rapporteur. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages Tunisia to continue this practice of placing the value of the lives of persons 
stranded at sea at the forefront of all migration-related maritime operations.

<p> VI. Detention of migrants ..............................................................................................  60&#8211;<footnote name="74">. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the fact that some Tunisians have been 
charged with participation in the smuggling of migrants, even though their participation had 
been limited to peripheral acts, they reportedly had little knowledge of the smuggling </footnote> 14 
</p>
<p>  A. Reception and orientation centres ...................................................................  60&#8211;<footnote name="6">. Tunisia has long been a country of emigration. Following the country&#8217;s 
independence in 1956, the principal destination for Tunisian migrants was north-western 
Europe. On the one hand, and, in particular, in relation to France, this can be attributed to 
the historical ties due to the country&#8217;s former status as a French protectorate, and the 
continued importance of the French language in Tunisia. However, practical factors also 
played an important role. Rapid post-war economic growth in north-western Europe created 
increasing labour shortages in unskilled sectors, such as industry, mining, housing 
construction and agriculture. Thus from the 1950s there was an increasing emigration of 
&#8220;guest workers&#8221; from North Africa, including Tunisia, to Europe. In fact, at that time 
Tunisia signed formal agreements on guest-worker recruitment with France, Germany, 
Belgium and the Netherlands. The guest worker was viewed as participating in a temporary 
circular migration which would fill labour shortages and simultaneously build the skills of 
these workers, which could help them assist their home countries when they would return </footnote>5 14 
</p>
<p>  B. Detention in prisons ........................................................................................  66&#8211;<footnote name="7">9. Importantly, as Choucha was established as a transit camp exceptionally due to the 
2011 war in Libya, the camp will likely be closed in 2013. This poses a particular problem 
for certain categories of persons currently residing in the camp: firstly, migrants with 
approved refugee claims who remain living in the camp as they have not been able to be 
resettled; and secondly, migrants with failed refugee claims. For the former category, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Tunisia to allow this relatively small number 
of persons who have not been resettled to remain in Tunisia and become self-reliant outside 
the transit camp. For the latter, while IOM is assisting with voluntary returns for those 
persons who wish to return to their countries, there remain a considerable number of </footnote>1  15 
</p>
<p>  C. Detention of Tunisians for migration-related offences ...................................  72&#8211;<footnote name="7">8. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern the fact that migrants in 
detention centres, including prisons, appear to not have any systematic opportunity to learn 
of the possibility of making an application for asylum. Despite the lack of a national 
framework law on refugee status, the Special Rapporteur notes the importance of the proper 
training of all persons who come into contact with migrants, including all persons operating 
at centres where migrants are held, border guards, and relevant personnel rescuing migrants 
at sea.  
</footnote>4 16 
</p>
<p> VII. Asylum  ................................................................................................................  75&#8211;<footnote name="7">7. Thus, the establishment of a clear asylum determination procedure is urgent in order 
to fully protect the rights of such vulnerable individuals, and may better facilitate the early 
recognition of certain categories of migrants crossing the border into Tunisia who may be 
deserving of refugee protection. In the context of the pending closure of the Choucha camp 
and in the interim period before this law is fully implemented, it is urgent that border 
guards, police and all other authorities with the power to detain migrants at border points or 
within Tunisia are trained on the principle of non-refoulement and the right of persons to 
seek asylum.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, 
conducted an official visit to Tunisia from 3 to 8 June 2012 at the invitation of the 
Government. The mission was carried out in the context of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s year-
long study on the general management of the external borders of the European Union and 
the impact on the human rights of migrants, which is the main focus of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s main report (A/HRC/23/46). The present report deals more specifically with 
the human rights situation of migrants in Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>2. During his six-day visit, the Special Rapporteur visited Tunis, the Port of La 
Goulette, the Port of Zarzis, the border point with Libya at Ras Jedir, places of migrant 
detention, including prisons and reception centres, and the Choucha refugee camp.  
</p>
<p>3. He met with a wide range of Government representatives, from, inter alia, the 
Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Secretary of State for 
European Affairs; the Ministry of Social Affairs, Solidarity and Tunisians Abroad, 
including the Secretary of State for Migration and Tunisians Abroad; the Ministry of 
Defence; and the Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice; as well as 
representatives of the police and the Coast Guard (Garde Nationale Maritime). He also met 
with intergovernmental organizations, including the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross and 
the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the representative of the European 
Union and other members of the diplomatic corps. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also met with the office in Tunis of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and representatives of the United 
Nations Country Team, and held meetings with civil society organizations and migrants 
themselves. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank everyone who took the time to 
meet with him for sharing information about their perspectives and experiences. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation for the support and cooperation 
the Government provided in planning and coordinating the visit. He would also like to 
sincerely thank the United Nations Resident Coordinator, and the OHCHR office in Tunis, 
for their indispensable support and assistance in carrying out this mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background on migration in Tunisia

</p>
<p>home to their families. Historically, these Tunisian migrant guest workers tended to fit the 
profile of single young men searching for economic opportunities.  
</p>
<p>7. Yet the mid-1970s marked a turning point, as an economic recession in Europe led 
to the onset of increasingly restrictive immigration policies pursued by those same 
European States that had traditionally welcomed Tunisian migrants. As a result, temporary 
labour migration to those countries was no longer an option, and family reunification 
programmes became the only vehicle for Tunisians who wanted to migrate to the region. 
Subsequently, the more flexible circular temporary migratory movements were replaced by 
more permanent alternatives, such as family reunification, for those Tunisians for whom 
such an option was available.  
</p>
<p>8. Despite the end of the guest-worker programme in the northern European States, the 
push-and-pull factors leading Tunisians to seek work abroad led to the swift emergence of 
other, more flexible, migration pathways to Europe. In particular by the mid-1990s, the 
growth in specific sectors in southern European economies, mainly in the spheres of export-
oriented agriculture, construction and tourism, coupled with large informal economies in 
those countries, fostered the demand for seasonal, flexible and low-skilled migrant labour. 
At that time, Tunisian migration increased dramatically to the region, in particular to Italy 
and Spain.  
</p>
<p>9. By the 1990s, as a result of the strengthening of European Union migration policy 
and the Schengen system, countries such as Italy and Spain were required to tighten their 
foreign-labour regimes, requiring visas for foreign workers, and effectively cutting off 
temporary seasonal work for Tunisians. This in turn led to a considerable increase in 
irregular migration of Tunisians across the sea to Italy; for many, this was the only way to 
enter Europe and look for work. It is notable that the outlying islands of Italy, such as 
Lampedusa, are only 113 km from the Tunisian coast.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur further observes that while Tunisia has historically been an 
important emigration country, shifting geopolitical factors have also led to it becoming an 
important country of both destination and transit. For example, increased investment in the 
education system has led to the Tunisian higher education system being one of the most 
highly regarded of the region, leading to an increase in students, in particular from other 
parts of Africa. Furthermore, the relocation of the African Development Bank to Tunis in 
2003 has gradually led to a rise in highly skilled immigration from other African States. 
</p>
<p>11. However, another, perhaps even more important, change in migration patterns is the 
fact that Tunisia appears to be becoming an important transit country for migrants coming 
mainly from other Maghreb and sub-Saharan African countries, many of whom aim to 
reach Europe. Thus the Tunisian coastline has become an important locale for irregular 
migration to Europe. Although there was a sharp spike in irregular boat departures 
following the Arab Spring (see section II (B) below), the Special Rapporteur would like to 
point out that Tunisian ports do not appear to be the main departure points for those trying 
to reach Europe by sea. Despite the lack of accurate statistics, evidence from coastal 
authorities on both sides of the Mediterranean indicate that the number of irregular 
departures from Tunisia remain relatively low, particularly when compared with Libya, 
which appears to remain the key route through which migrants attempt the treacherous 
crossing of the Mediterranean.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Migration and the Arab Spring 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 17 December 2010 the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old  </p>
<p>vegetable seller from Sidi Bouzid, in protest against the Government&#8217;s confiscation of his 
produce and denial of a livelihood, triggered a chain of protests around Tunisia, which </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>came to be known as the Jasmine Revolution. The revolution ultimately led to the fall of 
President Ben Ali on 14 January 2011. These events in turn reverberated not only in 
Tunisia but throughout the region, leading to the string of protests that has since been called 
the Arab Spring.1 
</p>
<p>13. During the crisis, tens of thousands of Tunisians embarked on journeys across the 
Mediterranean. In this context, 29,685 Tunisian migrants were recorded as entering Italy 
irregularly in 2011.2 The Special Rapporteur notes that the majority of the irregular 
crossings appears to have taken place in the spring of 2011, when, at the peak of the 
revolution, Tunisian police forces were otherwise occupied and coastal control was 
relatively weak. He also notes that many non-Tunisians embarked on irregular journeys to 
Europe at that time, including an estimated more than 17,000 sub-Saharan Africans.  
</p>
<p>14. An important issue is that hundreds of young Tunisian men seem to have 
disappeared attempting to cross the Mediterranean during the height of the Arab Spring. 
The whereabouts of many persons who allegedly attempted to flee Tunisia still remain 
unknown. Numerous protests criticizing both the Italian and Tunisian authorities&#8217; 
reluctance in dealing with the cases of the missing migrants have taken place in Tunisia. On 
11 January 2013, for instance, families of missing migrants observed a sit-in in front of the 
Italian Embassy in Tunis, defending their right to know the fate of their sons, missing since 
6 September 2012.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur observes, however, that despite European fears of mass 
influxes of migrants in the context of the Arab Spring, while there were some significant 
flows of Tunisian migrants across the Mediterranean to Italy, the total numbers were in fact 
rather low in comparison to the cross-border flows into Tunisia from Libya. Furthermore, 
the Special Rapporteur notes that according to statistical evidence, migration to Europe 
does not appear to have been accelerated by the Arab Spring, apart from the short-lived 
movement from Tunisia in 2011. Data have indicated that the changes in the region have 
not produced any significant inflow of new migrants to Europe: regular and irregular 
movements seem to have continued along a similar trajectory. Thus the Special Rapporteur 
observes that the flow experienced in 2011 appears to have been a sui generis response to 
the Arab Spring, and not an ongoing reality. 
</p>
<p>16. Moreover, perhaps the more significant impact of the Arab Spring in Tunisia was 
the upsurge in immigration to Tunisia itself. Following the Libyan crisis in early 2011, 
between 350,000 and 1 million persons fled Libya via the Tunisian border in the course of a 
few months, including an estimated 97,000 Tunisian returnees. While many of these were 
Libyans themselves, a large percentage of third-country nationals who were residing in 
Libya also fled. At that time, Tunisia implemented an open border policy with Libya, and 
the majority of the Libyan nationals fleeing were hosted by Tunisians in their homes. 
Despite the lack of precise data, as at 31 January 2012, the vast majority of those third-
country nationals had either returned to their country of origin or been resettled in third 
countries as refugees. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the important role IOM has 
played in the management of those extraordinary inflows of migrants at the borders, 
carrying out a number of activities in strict coordination with the Tunisian authorities, 
UNHCR and other United Nations agencies.

<p>17. With regard to management of migration flows, the Special Rapporteur commends 
the approach of the Government of Tunisia in dealing with the turbulent events of its 
revolution and of the neighbouring crisis in Libya in 2011. In view of the fact that the 
majority of those who entered from Libya have not remained in Tunisia, Tunisia has 
demonstrated how flexible, humanitarian approaches to migration crises can not only 
benefit people in need, but in fact become a tool that actively promotes and protects human 
rights at such junctures.  
18. However, one important effect of the increased migration flows of 2011 in the 
context of the Arab Spring is that both the Tunisian revolution and the crisis in Libya have 
had considerable impact on the discourse of migration and European borders, further 
cementing this on the agenda as one of the key political considerations between the 
European Union, its member States, and Tunisia (see section V below; see also 
A/HRC/23/46, para. 21). The Special Rapporteur takes note that the new interim 
Government also considers migration a national priority.

<p>and mandated to conduct unannounced visits to all places where migrants may be deprived 
of their liberty, including all centres of detention. 
</p>
<p>23. Under the now repealed Constitution of 1959, the international obligations of 
Tunisia took precedence over national law (art. 32). However, the Special Rapporteur notes 
with concern that the current draft text of the new constitution appears to be unclear on the 
primacy of the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations. Draft article 38 of the section 
on legislative power provides that &#8220;treaties ratified by the President and approved by the 
People&#8217;s Assembly shall have higher authority than laws&#8221;. However, draft article 1.17 
stipulates that compliance with international treaties is compulsory provided that the 
treaties do not conflict with provisions of the Constitution. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned by the latter provision, which not only appears to contradict the former, but also 
threatens the application of the international human right treaties to which Tunisia is a party 
and could affect the realization of the rights enshrined therein.  
</p>
<p>24. Tunisia is a member of the African Union, the Arab Maghreb Union, the League of 
Arab States and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD). 
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. Following the outburst of protests and the fall of President Ben Ali in 2011, Tunisia 
found itself in a period of instability, with two interim governments that quickly succeeded 
each other. On 7 March 2011, a third interim government was formed that pledged to 
organize the transparent election of a 217-seat National Constituent Assembly (NCA) 
mandated to draft a new constitution and name a new interim government. Elections were 
held on 23 October 2011 in which the Islamist party Ennahda received the greatest number 
of votes and formed a ruling coalition known as the Troika with two other parties.  
</p>
<p>26. Tunisia is currently undergoing a transition period. In this context, the national 
normative framework regarding human rights more generally, and migrants rights 
specifically, remains in flux. A number of new laws are being contemplated to respond to 
the key demand for increased respect for the exercise of basic human rights.

</footnote>) and freedom of 
conscience and religion (art. 2.<footnote name="3">5. A more recent law, No. 2004-6 of 3 February 2004, modified and completed the law 
of 1975. While leaving the penalties regarding irregular migration as established by the 
laws of 1968 and 1975 unchanged, the 2004 law was intended to implement the Smuggling 
of Migrants Protocol. However, in practice, the law provides for a sentence of between 3 
and 20 years in prison and a fine of between 8,000 to 100,000 Tunisian dinars (D) for 
helping people, even on a voluntary basis, to migrate irregularly. Another penalty of up to 
four years in prison is established for hosting an irregular migrant. The failure to report 
knowledge of an irregular migrant is also punishable. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, 
such provisions go far beyond the intention of the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol. 
</footnote>). The Special Rapporteur further observes that the draft 
constitution explicitly notes the right of freedom of movement within the country and the 
right to leave and return to the country (art. 2.4). 
29. Importantly, the draft further provides that a person can be detained only in 
accordance with the law: all detainees are to be informed of their rights and the charge 
against them, they should be given the possibility to be assisted by a lawyer, and the length 
of detention must be defined by law (art. 2.9). Any deprivation of liberty cannot result in 
degrading treatment or the denial of human rights (art. 2.10). The draft further guarantees 
the right to appeal before a fair, independent and neutral judge without distinction as to the 
nationality of the complainant (art. 2.6).  
30. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes these provisions, he further notes that a 
number of draft articles potentially undermine the global enjoyment of some fundamental 
human rights for migrants, by specifying their applicability only to citizens. These include: 
that only citizens have equal rights and duties before the law, and are equal before the law 
(art. 1.6) and that the State will guarantee the individual and public rights of citizens, and 
their decent conditions of life (art. 1.<footnote name="7">6. In this context, the Special Rapporteur learned that, currently, third-country 
nationals continue to attempt to cross from Libya to Tunisia irregularly by land. Many such 
persons have alleged protection claims. However, it was reported to the Special Rapporteur 
that asylum claims are not accepted at the border, and thus many of these persons attempt to 
reach the Choucha refugee camp where they can make an asylum claim, given the presence 
of UNHCR in the camp. However, the Special Rapporteur learned that if these persons are 
caught by Tunisian authorities before reaching the camp, they are pushed back by Tunisian 
authorities to Libya.  
</footnote>). Moreover, the right to equitable and decent work 
conditions (art. 2.14) and cultural rights (art. 2.<footnote name="3">EU/Tunisia Action Plan, available from 
 
 http://ec.europa.eu/world/enp/pdf/action_plans/tunisia_enp_ap_final_en.pdf.  
 
</footnote>2) are restricted to citizens. 
31. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Tunisia that non-
citizens, including migrants and migrants in an irregular situation, are equally the 
beneficiaries of human rights, and that, apart from the right to vote and be elected and the 
right to enter and stay on the territory, rights should not be restricted to citizens. He thus 
hopes that this is properly reflected in the draft text in order for the new constitution to meet 
the minimum international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Laws governing migration 
</b></p>
<p>32. Despite the fact that the 1959 Constitution provided for the right to leave the country 
(art. 10), a number of other laws which remain in force constrain this right, setting up a 
criminal framework for irregular border crossings.  
</p>
<p>33. Law No. 1975-40 of 14 May 1975, regarding passports and travel documents, 
provides that irregular leaving of the national territory is a crime punishable by a jail 
sentence of between 15 days and six months and a fine (art. 35).  
34. Decree No 1968-7 of 8 March 1968 regulates the entry and stay of foreigners in 
Tunisia and provides for a penalty of 1 month to one year in prison and a fine for migrants 
who enter or cross the border illegally (<i>franchissement ill&#233;gal de la fronti&#232;re</i>) or for those 
who stay in the country illegally. The law stipulates that they can be sent back and 
forbidden from re-entering the territory.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur observes that the absence of a specific legal framework for 
the protection of migrants contributes to their situation of vulnerability. The adoption of an 
updated national law that focuses on protection and promotion of their rights in accordance 
with international standards would be an important step to remedy this situation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>38. Since the election in late October 2011 and the subsequent appointment of the new 
interim Government, the Special Rapporteur was assured by various representatives of 
Government that migration is considered an important issue and remains a national priority. 
The Special Rapporteur is also aware that the interim Government is currently in the 
process of reconstituting many of its ministries, including their approach and policy 
regarding migration. Yet currently, there is no one institute or ministry that has sole 
competence in migration matters, resulting in a somewhat patchy institutional migration 
framework. 
</p>
<p>39. A new migration department has been created in the Ministry of Social Affairs 
through the creation of a Secretary of State position in charge of immigration and Tunisians 
abroad. This new department aims at gradually bringing under its supervision all units of 
other ministries working on migration. The Special Rapporteur observes that given the 
complex and multifaceted nature of migration policy, it will be important for the 
department to liaise with all other key actors within Government about the rights of non-
citizens, particularly during this critical transitional period.  
</p>
<p>40. In the interim period prior to the full operationalization of the new Secretary of 
State, the Ministry of the Interior continues to play a key role in migration, and in particular 
with regard to border management. Important competencies of the Ministry include its 
oversight of the reception and orientation centres, and prisons. It is also responsible for law 
enforcement, including the police and the National Guard. The National Guard, an armed 
civilian force, is in charge, inter alia, of the protection of land and maritime borders.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes that with the support of OHCHR and IOM, there is an 
endeavour to establish an anti-trafficking unit within the new migration department. A draft 
law has been prepared by the Centre for Legal and Judicial Studies of the Ministry of 
Justice, with the support of an interministerial committee (2010-2011); this law is currently 
being discussed and revised by an inter-institutional steering committee. The Special 
Rapporteur hopes that this will be swiftly implemented. 
</p>
<p>42. The Tunisian Armed Forces, consisting of a land army, navy and air force, also play 
a key role in the protection and monitoring of the borders of Tunisia, on land and at sea. In 
particular, the Navy works in close collaboration with the Coast Guard to carry out search 
and rescue operations at sea, and also works in close collaboration with the National Guard 
and the Ministry of the Interior in the management of borders. These agencies also work in 
close collaboration with European Union countries, in particular Italy, on search and rescue 
at sea.  
</p>
<p>43. At the bilateral and international levels, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in particular 
the Secretary of State for European Affairs, is responsible for negotiating bilateral 
agreements on migration.  
</p>
<p><b>  Newly created national human rights institutions and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that the Ministry must consider as a key priority the human rights of all persons 
on the State&#8217;s territory, including non-citizens.  
</p>
<p>45. The interim Government has also expressed its intention to revise the statute of the 
national human rights institution, the High Committee for Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, in order to align its mandate with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles), and a draft 
law has been developed to this end. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the draft law and 
considers that it could provide the grounds for the establishment of a robust national human 
rights institution with sufficient independence from the State. In particular, however, the 
Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the Committee must be explicitly empowered to carry 
out independent investigations, and in particular be tasked with looking into the human 
rights dimension of migration as it affects Tunisian emigrants but also immigrants, both 
regular and irregular, within Tunisia. Furthermore, the institution should be able to receive 
direct complaints from non-citizens and have the authority to <i>proprio motu</i> carry out visits 
to places of detention where migrants are held. Finally, the Special Rapporteur stresses the 
importance of the national institution being provided adequate resources to fulfil its 
mandate in all regions of Tunisia. In order to fully cement the independence and mandate of 
the institution, the Special Rapporteur notes that its establishment in accordance with the 
Paris Principles could be embedded within the new constitution.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Border management 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rescue at sea 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>recognized in Tunisia. Local settlement, through regular residency status, should also be 
considered and the Tunisian authorities are encouraged to consider this option. 
</p>
<p>48. Overall, the Special Rapporteur notes that there does not appear to be any formal 
agreement by which Tunisian authorities are obliged to carry out search and rescue 
operations beyond their own territorial waters in the northern Mediterranean. Yet, he noted 
that from the perspective of the Coast Guard, there appears to be implicit pressure from 
European member States on Tunisia to rescue and retrieve boats at risk with migrants in 
such cases. As one border guard noted about the migrants: &#8220;The Europeans will not accept 
them.&#8221; This status quo is troubling, and indicates the ongoing phenomenon of the 
externalization by Europe of its border control to its southern neighbours.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Border controls at ports 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Ministry of Defence also works in close collaboration with the gendarmerie, and 
the Ministry of the Interior, in the management of the border at ports. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur visited the Port of La Goulette, one of the main ports from which ferries 
cross the Mediterranean. Official statistics indicate that, annually, approximately 220 
irregular migrants are detected at the port attempting to depart Tunisia for Europe. The port 
is closely monitored, with border police working closely with the port authorities and 
Customs officials.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was informed that if someone is found to be attempting to 
depart Tunisia irregularly, he or she is charged with irregular border crossing and sent to a 
detention facility. He was told of a young Somali woman who was travelling with her baby 
the day before his visit to the port. She had hidden herself in the back of a truck, and her 
child was apparently hidden in a sack of grain, and the truck was about to board a ferry for 
Italy. Prior to its boarding, however, heat detection scanning technology led to their 
discovery. The woman was apparently then sent directly to a facility to be detained. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that he was not able to meet with this woman, and was not 
provided any information on her whereabouts. Moreover, the procedure for sending this 
woman and infant child to detention remained unclear. Given the fact that she was 
travelling with an infant, and in the light of her country of origin, it appears that she may 
indeed have had protection concerns. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes that it is 
essential that all persons working at border points, including port authorities, border police 
and Customs officials, be afforded comprehensive human rights training that highlights the 
human rights of migrants, relevant protection concerns and procedures that are required for 
the processing of such persons. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Engagement with the European Union in the sphere of 
migration 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. European Union&#8211;Tunisian relations 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Within the framework of the Association Agreement, a key pillar was the fight 
against irregular migration. Tunisia and the European Union created a working group to 
deal with social affairs and migration. A number of areas relating to migration, such as co-
development, social integration, visas, illegal migration, transit migration, improving 
information and concrete cooperation projects, have also been identified and are the subject 
of regular dialogue.  
</p>
<p>53. Following the revolution of 2011, there was a deepening of relations between the 
European Union and Tunisia, culminating in November 2012 with the establishment of a 
&#8220;privileged partnership&#8221; between Tunisia and the European Union, and negotiations 
towards a new action plan to be developed on the basis of the existing Association 
Agreement.3 The new action plan should define common priorities for bilateral cooperation, 
and provide a strategic framework for European Union support of the ongoing democratic 
reform process. 
</p>
<p>54. It is significant to note that the issue of migration remains one of key importance, 
with Tunisia noting mobility as one of its highest priorities in the context of the renewed 
partnership with the European Union.4 Indeed, the Special Rapporteur has learned that the 
action plan has identified migration as a key concern, and foresees the conclusion of a 
mobility partnership with Tunisia. Such a partnership will have as its goal the establishment 
a balanced framework for cooperation and responsible movement of people, management 
of legal migration, the links between migration and development, protection of migrants&#8217; 
rights and the fight against illegal migration, and organized crime related to immigration 
and readmission&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. Within the context of the 2005&#8211;2010 Action Plan, the Special Rapporteur takes note 
of the presence of two key points related directly to migration, specifically section 2.4 on 
cooperation on justice and home affairs, in particular the subsection entitled &#8220;Migration 
(legal and illegal, re-admission, visas, asylum)&#8221;, and section 2.3.4 on movement of persons, 
particularly workers, and coordination of social security systems. The Special Rapporteur 
notes the important references in section 2.4 to facilitating legal migration (&#8220;Ensure and 
promote effective management of migration flows&#8221;) and combating irregular migration. He 
also observes the clear focus on border management, with, as a key goal, the development 
of an effective, comprehensive border management system. The Special Rapporteur thus 
hopes that the new 2012 action plan will insist on human rights in the context of migration 
management, with any mobility partnership guaranteeing the rights of all migrants, 
including those with irregular status, and establishing appropriate and effective means for 
migrants to defend their rights.   
</p>
<p>56. In the wake of the Arab Spring, the European Union also launched in 2011 a new 
dialogue for migration, mobility and security with the southern Mediterranean countries.5 A 
key pillar of this new dialogue are mobility partnerships, which are joint political 
statements between the European Union and southern Mediterranean States conceptualized 
as an effort to move away from a security focus on migration towards a comprehensive 
approach. The goal of such partnerships is to allow Tunisian citizens greater access to the 
territory of the European Union in return for a commitment by Tunisia to work with the 
European Union in the field of migration management, especially in the fight against 
irregular immigration. Tunisia might be one of the first countries in the southern

</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>Mediterranean to benefit from such an initiative, and opportunities could include better 
access for Tunisians to the European Union labour market; financial or technical assistance, 
such as scholarships, for Tunisians wishing to study in the European Union; linguistic or 
technical training before leaving, for economic migrants; reintegration programmes for 
migrants who choose to return to their countries; and/or a twinning of employment services 
of the member States and their counterparts in third countries. The partnership will also 
ensure the creation of measures to reduce the brain drain and will encourage circular 
migration or return and visa facilitation, including the easing of procedures for issuing 
short-stay visas. 
</p>
<p>57. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes that those are indeed positive measures that 
will fundamentally affect European Union&#8211;Tunisian relations regarding migration, he 
observes the unequal relationship between the parties in this partnership. The result is a 
situation where Tunisia will accept its role in applying stronger border security measures in 
exchange for more lenient measures for its own citizens to enter Europe, for example 
through visa facilitation programmes. Left out of this equation, however, are the human 
rights of migrants, and in particular third-country nationals, whose human rights are often 
most at risk. The Special Rapporteur thus encourages the European authorities to ensure, in 
the context of the ongoing negotiations, a more nuanced policy of migration cooperation 
with Tunisia. Such policy should move beyond security issues to develop new initiatives in 
consultation and in real partnership with Tunisian authorities, which place at their core the 
respect, protection and promotion of the human rights of all migrants, including irregular 
migrants who are transiting through Tunisia. For example, the European Union should 
agree with Tunisian authorities on the following: the detention of migrants should always 
be justified, periodically reviewed by an independent tribunal, and limited to the minimum 
time necessary; children and families should not be detained; places of detention should be 
visited regularly by credible and appropriately funded civilian oversight mechanisms; 
migrants should not be criminalized for an irregular crossing or attempt. Furthermore, in 
collaboration with UNHCR, the European Union should continue to offer Tunisia 
additional places for the resettlement of refugees, and in collaboration with IOM, migrants 
should be offered voluntary return opportunities supported by appropriate funding for their 
reintegration back home. Once again, these solutions should not preclude local solutions 
through the granting by the Tunisian authorities of residency status, and the European 
Union should assist the Tunisian authorities with integration for those remaining in Tunisia.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Bilateral agreements with European Union member States 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also notes the importance of bilateral agreements with 
European Union member States in the field of migration management in the context of 
European Union&#8211;Tunisian relations. In this regard, the two most significant bilateral 
partnerships with migration-related content are with Italy and France. 
</p>
<p>59. However, the Government of Tunisia noted the increasing tendency of bilateral 
agreements with European countries to focus on the security aspect, including readmission 
of irregular Tunisians, and border control. For example, in 1998, Italy and Tunisia finalized 
an agreement that set conditions for the readmission of Tunisian and third-country 
nationals. As part of this agreement, Italy agreed to provide 500 million liras (&#8364;260,000) 
expressly for the creation of migrant detention facilities (<i>centri di</i> <i>permanenza</i>).6 A more 
recent agreement between the two countries, entered into since the Arab Spring, allows for

<p>expedited returns of irregular arrivals. However, it does not appear to safeguard the 
necessary procedural and substantive rights of those returned.<footnote name="7">5. Although Tunisia has also acceded to the Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and its Protocol, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the fact that 
there is no adequate refugee status determination procedure in Tunisia. He is aware that 
substantial progress has been made in this regard. A draft law on asylum is currently being 
developed, in coordination with UNHCR. The Special Rapporteur would encourage the 
continuing of the transparent consultative process in the drafting of this law, in order to 
produce a final text that meets international standards on refugee and asylum-seeker 
protection. He further hopes that such a text will be swiftly passed into law to ensure a 
comprehensive legal framework that would protect all refugees and asylum seekers in 
Tunisia.  
</footnote>  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Detention of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Reception and orientation centres  
</b></p>
<p>60. Although the Government denies the existence of immigration detention centres in 
Tunisia, migrants who are found to be on the territory irregularly are sometimes sent to 
<i>centres d&#8217;accueil et d&#8217;orientation</i> &#8211; essentially holding facilities from which migrants are 
identified and deported. The Government insisted that only one such centre exists in 
Tunisia, the Ouardia Centre in the south of Tunis. However, the Special Rapporteur learned 
through a number of reliable sources that, in fact, 13 centres exist around the country. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government did not facilitate his request to verify this 
fact, or his request to visit another of the 13 centres. He also regrets the lack of transparency 
around these centres, and urges the Government to be more open and forthcoming 
regarding not only information about the existence of these centres, but also with regard to 
allowing full and free access to these centres by international observers and civil society 
organizations, among others.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur further observes that, even though the Government of 
Tunisia insists that the Ouardia Centre is a reception and orientation centre (<i>centre 
d&#8217;h&#233;bergement et d&#8217;accueil des migrants</i>) and not a detention centre, the fact that persons in 
such centres are not free to leave contradicts this assertion. As long as individuals are being 
held against their will and thus deprived of their liberty in such facilities, the Special 
Rapporteur considers that they must, under international law, be considered detention 
centres.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit the Ouardia Centre in the course 
of his mission. The Centre, which has nine rooms and a maximum capacity of 100 beds, is 
managed by the Ministry of the Interior, and is where migrants are held prior to their 
expulsion from Tunisia. While the Special Rapporteur was told that persons are usually 
processed and removed within 10 days, he was also informed that a number of cases require 
more lengthy detention, particularly where persons lack adequate identifying or travel 
documentation, and particularly in the case of individuals whose consulates do not 
recognize them, or who have no consular presence in Tunis. According to the information 
received, a maximum stay is generally no longer than three weeks. This did not contradict 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations during his visit or other anecdotal evidence. It 
appears that migrants, however, are required to pay for their own deportation, and thus the 
length of detention can depend on the ability of migrants to raise the necessary finances.  
</p>
<p>63. The majority of those in the Ouardia Centre were persons who were irregularly in 
the territory or without valid documents. The Special Rapporteur also noted that a 
significant number of detainees were foreigners who had completed their prison sentence 
and who were awaiting expulsion. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was also informed 
that in 2011, many Tunisians were held in the Ouardia Centre for having left the country 
irregularly.  
</p>
<p>64. Overall, the Special Rapporteur found the facilities in the Ouardia Centre to be in 
reasonable condition; the facilities appeared clean. Persons were free to move around 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7

<p>during the day in designated areas, however, the bedrooms were locked at night. The 
kitchen area was large, stocks were replenished and migrants were allowed to cook for 
themselves. There appeared to be adequate access to health services, and at the time of the 
visit the Ouardia Centre was not overcrowded, and men and women were held in separate 
facilities. Staff at the Centre appeared to respect the rights of the migrants, and migrants, 
when interviewed independently, did not report mistreatment or poor conditions. Anecdotal 
evidence that the Special Rapporteur received confirmed his impressions. The Special 
Rapporteur also notes that a permanent social assistant is present in the Centre, sent from 
the Ministry of Social Affairs.  
</p>
<p>65. One issue that gravely concerned the Special Rapporteur was the fact that minors, 
including unaccompanied minors, are held at Ouardia Centre. Although minors appear to be 
kept separate from other detainees, this remains troubling. In one case, a minor had been in 
the centre for 21 days, charged with crossing the border into Tunisia illegally. He was 
sentenced to nine days&#8217; prison, which he served in a juvenile facility, and was thereafter 
transferred to Ouardia, where he awaited deportation. In this time, he had not been in touch 
with his family, and he was not taken to meet with consular authorities until he self-harmed 
in order to get the attention of the staff. The Special Rapporteur observes that detention, as 
a measure of last resort, should never be applied in the case of minors, especially 
unaccompanied minors, who are particularly vulnerable and who should be housed in 
shelters appropriate to their age. Moreover, irregular crossing of a border should not be a 
criminal offence, and a minor should never be criminalized for having crossed a border 
irregularly. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Detention in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur also met with migrants who had been charged with criminal 
offences and who were detained in Tunisian prisons. Tunisia has 26 main prisons, although 
specific data on the number of non-nationals detained does not appear to be currently 
available.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur visited the Harboub Prison in Medenine. This prison was 
selected due to its proximity to the Libyan border and in light of the relatively high 
numbers of migrants detained there. At the prison, numerous migrant inmates were able to 
share their experiences with the Special Rapporteur in confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur certainly recognizes the right of Tunisia to imprison any 
individual who commits a crime on its territory, and who is properly convicted by a court of 
law in accordance with all the rights connected with the right to a fair trial (International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 14). However, he remains concerned that 
certain categories of migrants appear to be detained on a regular basis in violation of these 
principles. In particular, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern the fact that many 
migrants are imprisoned in pretrial detention for extensive periods, often up to a year, 
without even knowing the charges against them. During this period, migrant detainees are 
often not given access to a lawyer, are unable to make phone calls to family members and 
are not put in contact with their consular authorities. The Special Rapporteur then learned 
that often migrants are eventually released without charges, asked to pay a D1,000 fine, and 
then deported.  
</p>
<p>69. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes that where migrants are charged with a 
crime, many appear to be charged with the crime of illegal border crossing. Of particular 
concern is the fact that irregular border crossing remains a criminal offence in Tunisia 
(<i>franchissement ill&#233;gal de la fronti&#232;re</i>). This contravenes fundamental principles of human 
rights, including the right to leave one&#8217;s country (International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, art. 12). While the Tunisian authorities insist that this is not regularly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>applied, the Special Rapporteur learned of cases where it was in fact used, including against 
both Tunisians and foreigners entering Tunisia irregularly, and who were subsequently 
imprisoned for the alleged offence. In fact, this offence seems to be applied 
indiscriminately, regardless of other protection concerns, including in the problematic case 
of the unaccompanied minor who was charged with this offence.  
</p>
<p>70. However, the Special Rapporteur observed that often migrants were also charged 
with drug-related offences. While he does not wish to prejudge the validity of these 
charges, the Special Rapporteur observes that, given the way such cases appear to be 
uniformly handled, it appears that these charges of drug-related crimes are potentially being 
misused in order to justify the detention of migrants. In particular, he notes that, in these 
cases, full fair-trial rights of migrants do not appear to be respected, with long periods of 
pretrial detention, uncertain evidentiary grounds, and the reality that irregular migrants, 
despite being charged with a criminal offence, are not provided with any legal assistance. 
The Special Rapporteur thus urges the Government to guarantee all fair-trial rights for 
migrants when facing imprisonment in criminal facilities, according to the established 
principles of international law. The guarantee of those procedures will ensure that criminal 
charges are not misused against migrants.  
</p>
<p>71. With regard to the Harboub Prison, the prison conditions faced by migrants were 
substandard, with overcrowded cells and limited other facilities. The Special Rapporteur of 
course notes that these conditions have an impact on all detainees, migrants and citizens 
alike, and welcomes the new Government&#8217;s willingness to increase openness and 
transparency regarding prison conditions, evidenced by its recent ratification of relevant 
international human rights treaties. However, he notes a number of concerns particular to 
migrant detainees. Migrants detained in prisons do not appear to be visited regularly by 
non-governmental or international organizations specialized in migrant rights, which is 
troubling, given their specific situation and potential protection concerns, including 
possible asylum or other humanitarian claims. In fact, the Special Rapporteur met with a 
number of detained migrants who appeared to have potential refugee claims. He thus notes 
the importance of improving prison management and providing training on the rights of 
migrants, as well as the need to facilitate regular access by independent monitors to prisons 
where migrants are detained. He also notes the necessity of training prison operators and 
guards on the basic principles of human rights law, including specific modules on the rights 
of migrants, and categories of vulnerability, including refugee protection.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Detention of Tunisians for migration-related offences 
</b></p>
<p>72. As noted above, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that irregular border 
crossing remains a criminal offence in Tunisia. Such a law contravenes fundamental 
principles of human rights, including the right to leave one&#8217;s country, and should 
immediately be repealed. He was informed that, in the period prior to the revolution, and in 
particular during the peak of the crisis in 2011, many Tunisians were held at both the 
Ouardia Centre and in prisons for this crime. However, the Special Rapporteur has learned 
that since the revolution this has been applied against Tunisians less systematically; when 
boats are intercepted, Tunisians are often held for just a few days in prison, and then 
released with a small fine.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that this crime does not appear to be 
prosecuted actively against Tunisians by the new interim Government. However, he urges 
the complete withdrawal of this law in accordance with the principles of international law.

<p>operation and they did not appear to be connected with the organization of the smuggling 
operation. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the gravity of migrant smuggling and 
the criminal nature of such actions, he also notes the importance of ensuring that all 
activities to combat smuggling are aimed at the highest level in order to ensure the 
culpability of those most responsible along the chain of criminality.

</p>
<p>persons who do not wish to return home and who could be considered stranded migrants. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Tunisia to work with all involved 
organizations to find an appropriate and durable solution for these persons, including by 
considering local settlement in Tunisia through the issuance of residency status. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In the context of the ongoing transition, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
positive steps the Government of Tunisia has taken towards ensuring an institutional 
framework conducive to the protection and promotion of human rights. These include 
the establishment of the Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, as well as 
the national mechanism to prevent torture and the revision of the legislation 
regarding national human rights institution, which are both close to being finalized.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the legal framework is relatively 
weak with regard to migrant rights, with old laws still in place that continue to 
criminalize irregular border crossing. Moreover, certain provisions of the draft 
constitution continue to differentiate between citizens and non-citizens, thus 
undercutting the universality of these rights. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Tunisia must ensure that the human rights of migrants are upheld equally to 
those of citizens, in accordance with international law. While the drafting of the 
constitution is a true test for the public institutions of Tunisia in the post-revolution 
era, it is essential that the constitution explicitly protect the rights for all persons 
within Tunisian territory, regardless of migration status. Moreover, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that it is essential that the Constitution does not subordinate the 
obligations of Tunisia under international law to domestic standards.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur further observes that the system of detention and 
removal of migrants in Tunisia remains unclear and opaque, with the existence of 13 
migrant detention centres remaining unconfirmed by the Government. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the Government should deploy all efforts to make transparent 
all aspects of these detention centres, including by facilitating access by independent 
observers and service providers to ensure that the human rights of migrants detained 
therein are at all times respected. Moreover, substantive reforms within the police and 
the justice system, including comprehensive training of all officers who come into 
contact with migrants, are urgently required to ensure that the human rights of 
migrants are guaranteed at all times. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
importance of framing not only bilateral arrangements, but also agreements with the 
European Union, in a way that will place the protection of the human rights of 
migrants at the core of all negotiations between all parties on all migration control 
issues.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Bearing in mind the fragile state of the democratic transition in which Tunisia 
finds itself, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends the consolidation of a 
human rights-based approach, which must ensure the respect, protection and 
promotion of all the rights of all persons within Tunisia, citizens and non-citizens 
alike. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Tunisia for its cooperation 
during his visit. He remains available to provide any technical assistance the 
Government may require in the implementation of the recommendations herewith. </b></p>

<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Develop regulations in line with international human rights standards 
concerning procedural safeguards and conditions of detention; ensure that all

</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Improve the human rights training of all staff working in detention

</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Regarding asylum seekers and refugees, the Government should:

</b></p>
<p><b>(d) In the context of the pending closure of the Choucha camp, ensure that

<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In the context of the migration and mobility partnership currently being

alternatives to the detention of migrants, in order to ensure that detention is 
considered only as a measure of last resort;

migration-related agreements with Tunisia to place human rights at the core of these 
agreements;
