</b></p>
<p><b>political, economic, social and cultural rights,

<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  28/12. Question of the realization in all countries of economic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the principles of economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 2005 World 
</p>
<p>Summit Outcome and General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly established the Human Rights Council, all affirm that all human rights are 
</p>
<p>universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be 
</p>
<p>treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and 
</p>
<p>recalling also that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never 
</p>
<p>exempt States from the promotion and protection of the other rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in which heads of State 
</p>
<p>and Government affirmed their commitment to spare no effort to promote democracy and 
</p>
<p>strengthen the rule of law and respect for all internationally recognized human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> its resolutions on the question of the realization in all countries of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, and the resolutions adopted by the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the same topic, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the obligations and commitments to take steps, individually and through 
</p>
<p>international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
</p>
<p>maximum of available resources with a view to achieving progressively the full realization 
</p>
<p>of economic, social and cultural rights by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
</p>
<p>adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the efforts made to achieve internationally agreed development goals, 
</p>
<p>mindful that the unfinished work on the Millennium Development Goals should continue in 
</p>

<p>the post-2015 development agenda, and recognizing the crucial importance of giving due 
</p>
<p>consideration to economic, social and cultural rights in the elaboration of this agenda, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining also</i> the human rights principles of, inter alia, non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p>human dignity, equity, equality, universality and participation, as affirmed in international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and 
</p>
<p>emphasizing that the rights enunciated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights are to be realized in a non-discriminatory manner, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human rights and social protection floors complement each other, 
</p>
<p>and that social protection floors, when used as a baseline, have the potential to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and to reduce poverty and inequality, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to give full effect to economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>

</p>
<p>clothing and housing, education and safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with

</p>
