<p>120. With regard to recommendations to review section 16 of its Constitution, Mauritius

laws. This measure has historical origins, whereby, prior to independence, the Muslim 
community had requested the inclusion of such provisions. A consensus has not yet been 
reached among the different schools of thought in the Muslim community in the country 
with regard to Muslim Personal Law. Mauritius stressed the need to be culturally sensitive.

introduced the Sexual Offences Bill, but following the dissolution of Parliament in 2010, 
consideration of the Bill was deferred. After consultations, it was decided in 2013 not to 
proceed with the Sexual Offences Bill as further consultations were needed on the matter. 
The Government decided to introduce a Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill to provide, inter 
alia, for marital rape.

<p>122. Regarding action to promote access to quality education and ensuring that children 
whose first language is different from the language of instruction are not disadvantaged, 
Mauritius clarified that Creole is a language of instruction in some primary schools and is 
also taught as a subject. 
</p><p>123. On the issue of trafficking in persons, Mauritius recalled the measures taken, 
including the setting up of a committee under the Office of the Prime Minister to address 
this issue. 
</p>
<p>124. On the issue of the death penalty, Mauritius stated that although the death penalty 
has been abolished by ordinary law, the Constitution has not yet been accordingly amended, 
which is the reason why the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights has not yet been ratified by Mauritius. </p>


<p>125. On the issue of overcrowding in prisons, Mauritius provided information on the 
10-year strategic plan that had been developed to address the issue with the assistance of a 
consultant from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 
</p>
<p>126. Mauritius provided additional information about the measures taken to combat 
violence against children and indicated that it had decided to include corporal punishment 
as an offence in the Children&#8217;s Bill in order to bring the laws more in line with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>127. Mauritius concluded by thanking all those who had participated in the discussions, 
and assured the Council that it would give serious consideration to all the comments and 
recommendations. It underlined the importance of respecting different cultural practices in 
Mauritius: as a multiracial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multicultural country, Mauritius 
cannot be insensitive to the needs and cultural rights of every Mauritian. It added that it 
would continue its policy of active cooperation with international organizations and their 
institutions in the field of human rights.
