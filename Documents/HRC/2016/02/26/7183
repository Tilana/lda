<p><i>Considering</i> the need to urgently address this serious situation, 
 
</p>
<p>1.  <i>Strongly deplores</i> the large-scale occurrence of serious violations and abuses of 
human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict, including 
increasingly widespread cases of sexual violence, summary executions, recruitment and use of 
child soldiers by armed groups, cases of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, massive displacement of populations and plundering of villages, and calls for an 
immediate end to those violations and abuses; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2.  <i>Underlines</i> that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has the 
primary responsibility for making every effort to strengthen the protection of the civilian 
population and to investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of violations of human rights and 
of international humanitarian law that constitute crimes, bearing in mind that each individual 
State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic 
cleansing and crimes against humanity; 
</p>
<p>

the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and welcomes the cooperation granted to 
date by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Court in surrendering 
those persons for whom arrest warrants were issued in the context of this situation, and the 
stated commitment of the Government to further combat impunity, including with regard to the 
Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5.  <i>Expresses support</i> to the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Envoy for the 
conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Olusegun Obasanjo, the African 
Union, the international community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in the search for a political solution as the only way to restore long-term peace and 
stability to the region, in particular within the Goma process and the Nairobi process; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6.  <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
and of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUC) to assist the Government in the promotion and protection of human rights, 
investigate human rights violations to put an end to impunity, and continue to cooperate with 
efforts to ensure that those responsible for violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law that constitute crimes are brought to justice; 
 
</p>
<p>7.  <i>Stresses the need</i> for the international community to strengthen its support for the 
work of the High Commissioner and MONUC in the field of human rights, in support of the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure full respect for human rights in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo; 
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/S-8/L.1

<p>8.  <i>Underlines</i>, in the light of the upcoming MONUC mandate review, the importance 
of enabling the Mission to reinforce its capacities to protect civilians and to further reinforce its 
human rights component; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9.  <i>Welcomes </i>the cooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the 
thematic special procedures of the Council as well as the invitations it has extended to some 
individual special procedures, and calls on it, in particular, to invite without delay all the 
thematic special procedures referred to in paragraph 2 of its resolution 7/20; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10.  <i>Reiterates</i> the request made to the thematic special procedures referred to in 
paragraph 7 of its resolution 7/20, to report to the Council no later than its session in March 
2009 on how best to assist technically the Democratic Republic of the Congo in addressing the 
situation of human rights, with a view to obtain tangible improvements on the ground, as well as 
the invitation to the High Commissioner to report to the Council at the same session on the 
human rights situation and the activities it has undertaken in the country, and stresses the need to 
address, as a matter of urgency, the current developments in the east of the country with regard 
to the human rights situation, including with regard to violence against women; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11.  <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment to examine urgently the situation of human rights in the east of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, particularly in the province of North Kivu, invites the Government of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo to invite without delay those Special Rapporteurs, and
