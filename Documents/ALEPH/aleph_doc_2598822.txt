accompanying Notice of Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders (the “Notice”) to be held on

information contained herein is given as of August 18, 2016, unless indicated otherwise.
APPOINTMENT AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES
The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy are directors and/or officers of the Company. Each
shareholder has the right to appoint a person or company, who need not be a shareholder of the
Company, other than the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy, to represent such
shareholder at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Such right may be exercised by inserting
such person’s name in the blank space provided and striking out the names of management’s
nominees in the enclosed form of proxy or by completing another proper form of proxy. All
proxies must be executed by the shareholder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing or, if
the shareholder is a company, by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized. The completed
form of proxy must be deposited at the office of TSX Trust Company, 200 University Avenue, Suite
300, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 4H1 (the mailing address for TSX Trust Company), before
4:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on September 26, 2016.
A shareholder who has given a proxy has the power to revoke it as to any matter on which a vote has not
already been cast pursuant to the authority conferred by such proxy and may do so either:
1.
2.

with the Chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting, prior to the commencement

3.
in any other manner permitted by law.
EXERCISE OF DISCRETION BY PROXIES
Shares represented by properly executed proxies in favour of the persons named in the enclosed form of
proxy will be voted or withheld from voting in accordance with the instructions of
the
securityholder on any ballot that may be called for and, where the person whose proxy is solicited
specifies a choice with respect to the matters identified in the proxy, the shares will be voted or
withheld from voting in accordance with the specifications so made. Where shareholders have
properly executed proxies in favour of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and have
not specified in the form of proxy the manner in which the named proxies are required to vote the
shares represented thereby, such shares will be voted in favour of the passing of the matters set
forth in the Notice. The enclosed form of proxy confers discretionary authority with respect
to
amendments or variations to the matters identified in the Notice and with respect to other matters that
may properly come before the Meeting. At the date hereof, management of the Company knows of no
such amendments, variations or other matters to come before the Meeting. However, if any other matters
which at present are not known to management of the Company should properly come before the
Meeting, the proxy will be voted on such matters in accordance with the best judgment of the named
proxies.
VOTING SHARES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF
Each holder of common shares in the capital of the Company (“Common Shares”) of record at the close
of business on August 18, 2016 (the “record date”) will be entitled to vote at the Meeting or at any
adjournment thereof, either in person or by proxy. As of August 18, 2016, the Company had 26,624,581
issued and outstanding Common Shares. Each Common Share carries the right to one vote per share.
The outstanding Common Shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”) under the
symbol “NR”.
To the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Company as of August 18, 2016, no
person beneficially owns, controls or directs, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the outstanding
Common Shares, other than as set forth below:

Note:
(1) The information as to the number and percentage of Common Shares beneficially owned, controlled or directed, not being
within the knowledge of the Company, has been obtained from Mr. Pollock directly.

NON-REGISTERED HOLDERS AND DELIVERY MATTERS
Only registered Shareholders, or the persons they appoint as their proxies, are permitted to vote at the
Meeting. Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners (“NOBOs”) may also vote at a meeting when the Company
chooses to mail to NOBOs directly.
These securityholder materials are being sent to both registered and non-registered owners of the
securities.
If you are a non-registered owner, and the Company or its agent has sent these materials
directly to you, your name and address and information about your holdings of securities, have been
obtained in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements from the intermediary
(“Intermediary”) holding on your behalf. By choosing to send these materials to you directly, the
Company (and not the Intermediary holding on your behalf) has assumed responsibility for (i) delivering
these materials to you, and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions.
If you have received the Company’s form of proxy, you may return it to TSX Trust Company: (i) by
regular mail in the return envelope provided, or (ii) by fax at (416) 595-9593.
Objecting Beneficial Owners (“OBOs”) and other beneficial holders receive a Voting Instruction Form
(“VIF”) from an Intermediary by way of instruction of their financial institution. Detailed instructions of
how to submit your vote will be on the VIF.
In either case, the purpose of this procedure is to permit non-registered holders to direct the voting
of the Common Shares they beneficially own. Should a non-registered holder who receives either
form of proxy wish to vote at the Meeting in person, the non-registered holder should strike out the
persons named in the form of proxy and insert the non-registered holder’s name in the blank space
provided. Non-registered holders should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediary including
those regarding when and where the form of proxy or VIF is to be delivered.
The Company is using the “notice-and-access” provisions of National Instrument 54-101 (“NI 54-101”)
in connection with the delivery of the Meeting materials in respect of the Meeting. The Company is not
sending such Meeting materials directly to NOBOs in accordance with NI 54-101, and it intends to pay
for intermediaries to deliver such Meeting materials to OBOs.

in all capacities to the Company for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, in respect of

Exercise of Compensation Securities by Directors and Named Executive Officers
No compensation securities were exercised by any Named Executive Officers or directors of the
Company during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Company’s approach to executive compensation has been to provide suitable compensation for
executives that is internally equitable, externally competitive and reflects individual achievement. The
Company attempts to maintain compensation arrangements that will attract and retain highly qualified
individuals who are able and capable of carrying out the objectives of the Company.
6
The Company’s compensation arrangements for the Named Executive Officers may, in addition to salary,
include compensation in the form of bonuses and, over a longer term, benefits arising from the grant of
stock options. Given the stage of development of the Company, compensation of the Named Executive
Officers to date has emphasized meaningful stock option awards to attract and retain Named Executive
Officers and, to a certain extent, to conserve cash. This policy may be re-evaluated in the future to
instead emphasize increased base salaries and/or cash bonuses with a reduced reliance on option awards,
depending upon the future development of the Company and other factors which may be considered
relevant by the board from time to time.
During fiscal 2016, (i) the Chief Executive Officer of the Company was not paid a salary with respect to
the period from September 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016; (ii) the former Chief Executive Officer of the
Company was not paid a salary with respect to the period from April 1, 2015 to September 1, 2015; and
(ii) the Chief Financial Officer of the Company was not paid a salary (but was paid an aggregate of
$36,681 in consulting services through MSS and affiliated companies, as described above under
“Summary Compensation Table”). The board of directors of the Company establishes and reviews the
Company’s overall compensation philosophy and its general compensation policies with respect to the
Chief Executive Officer and other officers, including the corporate goals and objectives and the annual
performance objectives relevant to such officers. The board evaluates each officer’s performance in light
these goals and objectives and, based on its evaluation, determines and approves the salary, bonus,
options and other benefits for such officers.
In determining compensation matters, the board may
consider a number of factors, including the Company’s performance, the value of similar incentive
awards to officers performing similar functions at comparable companies, the awards given in past years
and other factors it considers relevant. The current overall objectives of the Company’s compensation
strategy is to reward management for their efforts, while seeking to conserve cash given current market
conditions. With respect to any bonuses or incentive plan grants which may be awarded to executive
officers in the future, the Company has not currently set any objective criteria and will instead rely upon
any recommendations and discussion at the board level with respect to the above-noted considerations
and any other matters which the board may consider relevant on a going-forward basis, including the cash
position of the Company.
Existing options held by the Named Executive Officers at the time of subsequent option grants are taken
into consideration in determining the quantum or terms of any such subsequent option grants. Options
have been granted to directors, management, employees and certain service providers as long-term
incentives to align the individual’s interests with those of the Company. The size of the option awards is
in proportion to the deemed ability of the individual to make an impact on the Company’s success.
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Directors of the Company are currently paid a fee of $200 for each meeting of the board attended, and are
also reimbursed for travel and other out of pocket expenses incurred in attending directors’ and
shareholders’ meetings. Directors are also entitled to receive compensation to the extent that they provide
services to the Company at rates that would be charged by such directors for such services to arm’s length
parties. During the year ending March 31, 2016, directors fees in the aggregate amount of $3,000 were
paid to directors of the Company, and no other fees were paid to any director or a corporation associated
with any director.
Directors are also entitled to participate in the stock option plan of the Company. As of August 18, 2016,
the Company had outstanding options to purchase 960,000 Common Shares, of which 460,000 have been
granted to directors. See “Summary of Stock Option Plan”.

exchange upon which the Common Shares may be listed or may trade from time to time. In the event that
any optionee who is a service provider ceases to be a service provider for the Company for any reason
other than death, the optionee will be entitled to exercise his or her options only within a period of 90
days next succeeding such cessation (or 30 days if such person is providing investor relations services) or
such other date as may be determined by the board subject to regulatory approval, but in no event may
any options be exercised following the expiry date thereof. In the event of the death of an optionee during
the currency of the optionee's option, such options may only be exercised within a period of one year
succeeding the optionee's death or such other date as may be determined by the board subject to
regulatory approval, up to the expiry date thereof.
The total number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance to any one individual under the
Option Plan within any one year period shall not exceed 5% of the outstanding issue. The maximum
number of stock options which may be granted to any one consultant under the Option Plan, any other
employer stock options plans or options for services, within any 12 month period, must not exceed 2% of
the Common Shares issued and outstanding at the time of the grant (on a non-diluted basis). The
maximum number of stock options which may be granted to persons performing investor relations
services under the Option Plan, any other employer stock options plans or options for services, within any
12 month period must not exceed, in the aggregate, 2% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding at
the time of the grant (on a non-diluted basis).
The maximum number of Common Shares which may be reserved for issuance to insiders under the
Option Plan, any other employer stock option plans or options for services, shall be equal to 10% of the
Common Shares issued and outstanding at the time of the grant (on a non-diluted basis). The maximum
number of options which may be granted to insiders under the Option Plan, any other employer stock
option plans or options for services, within any 12 month period, shall be equal to 10% of the Common
Shares issued and outstanding at the time of the grant (on a non-diluted basis). The maximum number of
Common Shares which may be issued to any one optionee, under the Option Plan together with any other
employer stock option plans or options for services, within a one year period shall be equal to 5% of the
Common Shares outstanding at the time of the grant (on a non-diluted basis).
The exercise price of options granted under the Option Plan may not be lower than the market price of the
Common Shares at the time the option is granted, as calculated based upon the prior trading day closing
price of the Common Shares on any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed or dealing
network where the Common Shares trade, where applicable.
In the event that there is no such closing
price or trade on the prior trading day, the market price shall be based upon the average of the daily high
and low board lot trading prices of the Common Shares on any stock exchange on which the shares are
listed or dealing network on which the Common Shares trade for the five immediately preceding trading
days.
Options issued under the Option Plan vest at the discretion of the board or committee established for the
purpose of administering the Option Plan, as applicable, subject to certain specified limitations.
The board or any committee of the board appointed to administer the Option Plan, as applicable, may at
any time amend or terminate the Option Plan, but where amended, such amendment is subject to
regulatory approval.
At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed fit, pass a resolution confirming the
Option Plan. See “Particulars of Matters to be Acted Upon – Confirmation of Option Plan”.

STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
National Policy 58-201 of the Canadian Securities Administrators has set out a series of guidelines for
effective corporate governance (the “Guidelines”). The Guidelines address matters such as the
constitution and independence of corporate boards, the functions to be performed by boards and their
committees and the effectiveness and education of board members. National Instrument 58-101 (“NI 58-
101”) of the Canadian Securities Administrators requires the disclosure by each listed corporation of its
approach to corporate governance with reference to the Guidelines as it is recognized that the unique
characteristics of individual corporations will result in varying degrees of compliance.
Set out below is a description of the Company’s approach to corporate governance in relation to the
Guidelines.
The Board of Directors
NI 58-101 defines an “independent director” as a director who has no direct or indirect material
relationship with the Company. A “material relationship” is in turn defined as a relationship which could,
in the view of the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), be reasonably expected to interfere
with such member’s independent judgement. The Board is currently comprised of seven members, the
majority of which the Board has determined are “independent directors” within the meaning of NI 58-
101.
Mr. Pollock is not considered to be “independent” as the result of his previous role as President of the
Company. Mr. Kelly is not considered to be “independent” as a result of his position as President and
Chief Exectuive Officer of the Company.
Messrs. Rankin, Flynn, Hancock and Kveton and Ms. Dipucchio are considered independent directors
since they are all independent of management and free from any material relationship with the Company.
The basis for this determination is that, since the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, none
of the independent directors have worked for the Company, received remuneration from the Company in
excess of $75,000 in any 12 month period within the last three years, or had material contracts with or
material interests in the Company which could interfere with their ability to act with a view to the best
interests of the Company.
The Board believes that it functions independently of management. To enhance its ability to act
independent of management, the Board may meet in the absence of members of management and the non-
independent directors or may excuse such persons from all or a portion of any meeting where a potential
conflict of interest arises or where otherwise appropriate. The Board did not hold any meetings of the
independent directors in the absence of members of management and the non-independent directors
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
Directorships
Certain of the directors of the Company are also directors of other reporting issuers (or equivalent) in a
jurisdiction or a foreign jurisdiction as follows:

Orientation and Continuing Education
While the Company currently has no formal orientation and education program for new Board members,
sufficient information (such as recent annual reports, prospectus, proxy solicitation materials, technical
reports and various other operating, property and budget reports) is provided to any new Board member to
ensure that new directors are familiarized with the Company’s business and the procedures of the Board.
In addition, new directors are encouraged to visit and meet with management on a regular basis. The
Company also encourages continuing education of its directors and officers where appropriate in order to
ensure that they have the necessary skills and knowledge to meet their respective obligations to the
Company.
Ethical Business Conduct
The Board monitors the ethical conduct of the Company and ensures that it complies with applicable legal
and regulatory requirements, such as those of relevant securities commissions and stock exchanges. The
Board has found that the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by the Company’s governing
corporate legislation and the common law, as well as the restrictions placed by applicable corporate
legislation on the individual director’s participation in decisions of the Board in which the director has an
interest, have been sufficient to ensure that the Board operates independently of management and in the
best interests of the Company.
Nomination of Directors
The full Board performs the functions of a nominating committee with responsibility for the appointment
and assessment of directors. The Board believes that this is a practical approach at this stage of the
Company’s development and given the small size of the Board.
13
While there are no specific criteria for Board membership, the Company attempts to attract and maintain
directors with business knowledge and a particular knowledge of mineral exploration and development or
other areas (such as finance) which provide knowledge which would assist in guiding the officers of the
Company. As such, nominations tend to be the result of recruitment efforts by management of the
Company and discussions among the directors prior to the consideration of the Board as a whole.
Compensation
The full Board functions as the compensation committee of the Company for the purpose of reviewing on
an annual basis the adequacy and form of compensation of directors and the President to ensure that such
compensation reflects the responsibilities, time commitment and risks involved in being an effective
director and/or officer.
Currently, as the Company is an exploration company with no ongoing revenues from operations, the
Company does not pay any director fees other than a fee of $200 for each meeting of the board attended,
as described under “Compensation of Directors”. All directors are eligible to participate in the Option
Plan. See “Compensation of Directors” and “Summary of Stock Option Plan”.
Other Board Committees
The Board currently has no standing committees other than the audit committee. See “Audit Committee”.
Assessments
The Board assesses, on an annual basis, the contributions of the Board as a whole and each of the
individual directors, in order to determine whether each is functioning effectively.
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS OR COMPANIES
IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
Except as otherwise disclosed in this Information Circular, none of the directors or executive officers of
the Company, no nominee for election as a director of the Company (“Nominee”), none of the persons

PARTICULARS OF MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON
1.
Financial Statements
The shareholders will receive and consider the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 together with the auditor’s report thereon.
2.
Election of Directors
Under the constating documents of the Company, the Board is to consist of a minimum of one and a
maximum of 20 directors, to be elected annually. Shareholders will be invited to elect four directors at
the Meeting. Each director holds office until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly
elected or appointed unless his or her office is earlier vacated in accordance with the Company’s by-laws.
On any ballot that may be called for in the election of directors, the persons named in the enclosed form
of proxy intend to cast the votes to which the Common Shares represented by such proxy are entitled for
the proposed Nominees whose names are set forth below, unless the shareholder who has given such
proxy has directed that the Common Shares be otherwise voted or withheld from voting in respect of the
election of directors. Management does not contemplate that any of the Nominees will be unable to serve
as a director, but if that should occur for any reason prior to the Meeting, the persons named in the
enclosed form of proxy reserve the right to vote for other Nominees at their discretion.
The following table sets out the name of each of the Nominees, all positions and offices in the Company
held by each of them, the principal occupation or employment of each of them for the past five years, the
year in which each was first elected a director of the Company and the approximate number of Common

3.
Appointment of Auditors
The directors propose to nominate Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton Labonte LLP, the present auditors, as the
auditors of the Company to hold office until the close of the next annual meeting of shareholders. The
present auditors of the Company were first appointed on March 1, 2016, prior to which (i) Abraham Chan
LLP served as auditors of the Company from March 23, 2015 to March 1, 2016; and (ii) MNP LLP
(formerly MSCM LLP) served as auditors of the Company from May 2, 2007 to March 23, 2015. See
additionally Schedule C, Auditor Reporting Package, attached hereto for the reporting package in respect
of the change of auditor of the Company from Abraham Chan LLP to Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton
Labonte LLP effective March 1, 2016.
In the past, the directors have negotiated with the auditors of the Company on an arm’s length basis in
determining the fees to be paid to the auditors. Such fees have been based on the complexity of the
matters in question and the time incurred by the auditors. The directors believe that the fees negotiated in
the past with the auditors of the Company were reasonable and in the circumstances would be comparable
to fees charged by other auditors providing similar services.
In order to appoint Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton Labonte LLP as auditors of the Company to hold office
until the close of the next annual meeting, and authorize the directors to fix the remuneration thereof, a
majority of the votes cast at the Meeting must be voted in favour thereof.
The management representatives named in the attached form of proxy intend to vote in favour of
the appointment of Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton Labonte LLP as auditors of the Company and in
favour of authorizing the directors to fix the remuneration of the auditors, unless a shareholder
17
specifies in the proxy that his or her Common Shares are to be withheld from voting in respect of
the appointment of auditors and the fixing of their remuneration.
4.
Confirmation of Option Plan
The shareholders of the Company originally approved the Option Plan on September 23, 2009. Up to
10% of the total number of Common Shares issued and outstanding from time to time are currently
reserved for issue upon the exercise of options granted pursuant to the Option Plan. Options to purchase
960,000 Common Shares are currently outstanding under the Option Plan as of August 18, 2016. See
“Summary of Stock Option Plan” above.
Set forth below is a summary of the 960,000 outstanding options to purchase Common Shares under the
Option Plan as at the date hereof:

The regulations of the TSXV mandate that the Company obtain shareholder approval of the Option Plan
annually. Accordingly, shareholders will be invited at the Meeting to consider and, if thought fit,
authorize the resolutions substantially in the form attached as Schedule B to this Information Circular (the
“Option Plan Resolutions”) to confirm and ratify the Option Plan.
If the Option Plan Resolutions are approved, the Option Plan will remain in force and all options granted
under the Option Plan to date will remain outstanding, in each case without any amendment to their
terms.
Approval of the Option Plan Resolutions will be obtained if a majority of the votes cast are in favour
thereof.
The board of directors of the Company recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Option
Plan Resolutions. The management representatives named in the attached form of proxy intend to
vote in favour of the Option Plan Resolutions, unless a shareholder specifies in the proxy that his or
her Common Shares are to be voted against the Option Plan Resolutions.

5.
Consolidation
Management believes that the current number of outstanding Common Shares are inconsistent with the
size, assets and structure of the Company. Management proposes to reduce the number of Common
Shares in order to increase its flexibility with respect to potential business transactions, including any
equity financings, if determined by the Company to be necessary.
Shareholders are being asked to consider and, if deemed appropriate, to pass a special resolution
substantially in the form attached as Schedule “D” hereto (the “Consolidation Resolution”) authorizing
the board of directors, in its sole discretion, to consolidate the Common Shares on the basis of one (1)
new Common Share for up to every three (3) “old” Common Shares then outstanding, with the final such
ratio to be determined by the board of directors of the Company (the “Consolidation”). Notwithstanding
the approval of the Consolidation by shareholders, the board of directors may, in its sole discretion,
revoke the Consolidation Resolution, and abandon the Consolidation without further approval or action
by or prior notice to shareholders. Prior to effecting the Consolidation, the Company shall first be
required to obtain any and all applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the TSXV.
Reasons for the Consolidation
The board of directors believes that shareholder approval of a maximum potential consolidation ratio
(rather than a single consolidation ratio) provides the board of directors with maximum flexibility to
achieve the desired results of the Consolidation, and to ensure that the Company remains in compliance
with applicable shareholder distribution requirements of any applicable exchange listing.
the
Consolidation Resolution is approved, the Consolidation will be implemented, if at all, only upon a
determination by the board of directors that the Consolidation is in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders at that time. In connection with any determination to implement a Consolidation, the
Company’s board of directors will set the timing for the Consolidation and select the specific ratio from
within the range for a ratio set forth in the Consolidation Resolution.
If
Certain Risks Associated with the Consolidation
There can be no assurance that the total market capitalization of the Common Shares (the aggregate value
of all Common Shares at the then market price) immediately after the Consolidation will be equal to or
greater than the total market capitalization immediately before the Consolidation. In addition, there can be
no assurance that the per-share market price of the Common Shares following the Consolidation will be
higher than the per share market price immediately before the Consolidation or equal or exceed the direct
arithmetical result of the Consolidation. In addition, a decline in the market price of the Common Shares
after the Consolidation may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a
Consolidation and the liquidity of the Common Shares could be adversely affected. Further, there can be
no assurance that, if the Consolidation is implemented, the margin terms associated with the purchase of
Common Shares will improve, the Company will be successful in receiving increased attention from
institutional
in completing any proposed business
transaction or equity financing.
Principal Effects of the Consolidation
As of August 16, 2016, the Company had 26,624,581 Common Shares issued and outstanding. Following
the completion of the proposed Consolidation, the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding will
depend on the ratio selected by the Company’s board of directors.
investors, or the Company will be successful
19
The Consolidation will not have any effect on the number of Common Shares that remain available for
future issuances. The Common Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s Option Plan and
any other outstanding convertible securities will be reduced proportionately.
The Consolidation may result in some shareholders owning “odd lots” of less than 100 Common Shares
on a post-Consolidation basis. Odd lots may be more difficult to sell, or require greater transaction costs
per share to sell, than shares in “board lots” of even multiples of 100 shares. Brokerage commissions and
other costs of transactions in odd lots are often higher than the costs of transactions in “round lots” of
even multiples of 100 shares.
Fractional Shares
No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon the Consolidation. All fractions of post-Consolidation
Common Shares will be rounded to the next lowest whole number.
Percentage Shareholdings
The Consolidation will not affect any shareholder’s percentage ownership in the Company, even though
such ownership will be represented by a smaller number of Common Shares. Instead, the Consolidation
will reduce proportionately the number of Common Shares held by all shareholders.
Implementation
Upon determining to proceed with the Consolidation and the Consolidation ratio, the Company will send
letters of transmittal to holders of Common Shares for use in transmitting their share certificates to the
Company’s transfer agent in order to exchange old certificates for new certificates representing the
number of Common Shares to which such shareholder is entitled as a result of the Consolidation. No
delivery of new certificates to a shareholder will be made until the shareholder has surrendered their
current issued certificates. Until surrendered, each share certificate formally representing old Common
Shares shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of new Common Shares to which the
holder is entitled as a result of the Consolidation. No delivery of a new certificate to a shareholder will be
made until the shareholder has surrendered his, her or its current issued certificates.
The implementation of the Consolidation is conditional upon the Company obtaining the necessary
regulatory consents. The Consolidation Resolution provides that the board of directors is authorized, in its
sole discretion, to determine not to proceed with the proposed Consolidation, without further approval of
the Company’s shareholders. In particular, the board of directors may determine not to present the
Consolidation Resolution to the Meeting or, if the Consolidation Resolution is presented to the Meeting
and approved, may determine after the Meeting not
to proceed with completion of the proposed
Consolidation and filing the articles of amendment.
Effect on Non-registered Shareholders
Non-registered shareholders holding their Common Shares through a bank, broker or other nominee
should note that such banks, brokers or other nominees may have different procedures for processing the
Consolidation than those that will be put in place by the Company for registered shareholders. If you hold
your Common Shares with such a bank, broker or other nominee and if you have any questions in this
regard, you are encouraged to contact your nominee.
Vote Required and Recommendation of Board of Directors
Approval  of  the  Consolidation  Resolution  will  be  obtained  if  66⅔%  of  the  votes  cast  are  in  favour 
thereof.
20
The board of directors of the Company recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the
Consolidation Resolution. The management representatives named in the attached form of proxy
intend to vote in favour of the Consolidation Resolution, unless a shareholder specifies in the proxy
that his or her Common Shares are to be voted against the Consolidation Resolution.
