<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/8, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to undertake, with the assistance of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a questionnaire to seek the views of 
States on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation 
strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. In its resolution 24/10, the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to continue to 
undertake the survey to seek the views of both States and indigenous peoples, with a view 
to completing a final summary of responses for presentation to the Council at its twenty-
seventh session. The present report builds upon the report presented to the Council at its 
twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/24/51) and integrates additional responses received from 
States and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>2. The questionnaires for both States and indigenous peoples focused on the following 
issues: development of an overarching or national strategy; adoption of specific legal, 
policy or other measures to implement the Declaration; whether the Declaration had been 
taken into account when devising relevant laws, policies and other measures; whether steps 
had been taken to raise awareness of the Declaration at the community and government 
levels; challenges encountered when adopting measures to attain the goals of the 
Declaration; and views on best practices regarding appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration. In their responses, States 
and indigenous peoples were asked to consider six different thematic areas: self-
determination and autonomy; participation in decision-making, including obligations to 
seek to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples; culture and 
languages; non-discrimination and equality; lands, territories and resources; and treaties, 
agreements and other constructive arrangements with States.1  
</p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism thanks the States that responded to the questionnaire. 
Responses were received from Australia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Chile, the Congo, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, 
Germany, Guyana, Iraq, Kazakhstan, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Mexico, 
Myanmar, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, 
Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and the United States of America.  
</p><p>4. The Expert Mechanism also thanks the indigenous peoples and indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations that responded to the questionnaire. Responses were received from Aldet 
Centre (Saint Lucia); Botswana Khwedom Council (Botswana); Community for the 
Advancement of Native Studies (United States); Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo 
de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos (Peru); Centro de Promoci&#243;n y Desarrollo Rural 
Amaz&#243;nico (Peru); Comunidad Ember&#225; Pur&#250; de San Juan de Pequeni (Panama); Indigenous 
Bar Association (Canada); Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation (Viet Nam); Naga 
Women&#8217;s Union and Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights (India); National Khoi-
San Council (South Africa); National Native Title Council (Australia); National Indian 
Youth Council (United States); Ogoni Indigenous Ministers Forum (Nigeria); Programme 
d&#8217;Int&#233;gration et de D&#233;veloppement du Peuple Pygm&#233;e au Kivu (Democratic Republic of the 
Congo); S&#225;mi Parliament of Norway; San Support Organizations&#8217; Association of Namibia;

<p>6. The Expert Mechanism also thanks the Faculty of Law at the University of 
Manitoba, Canada, for its assistance in reviewing the responses from States. 
</p>
<p><b> II. State responses 
</b>7. This section summarizes the responses from States to the questionnaire. It must be 
borne in mind that non-State actors, including indigenous peoples, may have conflicting 
views on the benefits of measures adopted to implement the Declaration or the ideal 
strategies to achieve its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> A. National implementation strategies 
</b></p>
<p>8. A number of States indicated that they had a national strategy to implement the 
Declaration. Guyana indicated that its implementation strategy was adumbrated in several 
policy documents, at least one of which was developed in consultation with the great 
majority of Amerindian communities. The National Development Plan of Mexico addresses 
indigenous peoples specifically and its Commission for the Development of Indigenous 
Peoples is required to assist indigenous peoples in the exercise of their self-determination. 
The plan of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is based on normative and institutional 
aspects, including already existing constitutional, legislative and regulatory norms. The 
national plan of Peru focuses on 12 areas, including participation, intellectual property, 
intercultural and bilingual education, use and transmission of indigenous languages, non-
discrimination, consultation, improvement in economic and social conditions, land, 
territories and natural resources, health, administration of justice, access to justice, first 
contact and isolated indigenous peoples. The Paraguayan Institute of Indigenous Affairs 
works towards the implementation of the Declaration along three axes: lands and territories, 
participation and development with an ethnic perspective. 
</p>
<p>9. Several States indicated that the principles of the Declaration are reflected in 
national legislation. For example, the Congo indicated that the fundamental principles of 
the Declaration are incorporated in its law No. 5-2011 on the promotion and protection of 
the rights of indigenous peoples. Some States, such as Peru and Myanmar, identified 
existing national laws and policies which related to specific areas of the Declaration, such 
as education and culture. However, it is unclear whether these laws and policies were 
developed specifically to implement the goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>10. Some States, such as Finland, New Zealand and Norway, indicated that existing 
national laws and policies already conformed to the principles contained in the Declaration 
and therefore they had not developed additional strategies to implement the Declaration. 
Australia noted synergies between existing policies addressing Aboriginal peoples and the 
Declaration.  
</p>
<p>11. The response of the Plurinational State of Bolivia did not explicitly indicate whether 
it had a specific strategy to implement the Declaration. However, its national development 
plan, entitled &#8220;<i>Bolivia digna, soberana, productiva y democr&#225;tica para vivir bien</i>&#8221;, was 
developed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the objectives of the second 
International Decade of Indigenous Peoples. The Chilean strategy to implement its 
international obligations in relation to indigenous peoples domestically is focused on five 
areas: culture, identity and education; land; institutional capacity; participation and 
consultation; and integral development. This policy was developed through dialogue with 
the nine indigenous peoples in the country.  </p>


<p>12. While El Salvador does not have a specific strategy for its implementation, the 
Declaration is part of the normative framework for a draft policy on indigenous peoples 
developed in 2013.  
</p>
<p>13. Despite not having a formal strategy for implementing the Declaration, Australia 
cited the Apology of 2008 to Australia&#8217;s indigenous peoples, and in particular to the stolen 
generations, as a symbolic gesture signalling its commitment to implementing the 
Declaration. In addition, Australia indicated that the principles of the Declaration were 
consistent with &#8220;Closing the gap&#8221;, the Government strategy to address indigenous 
disadvantage. Discussions are under way for the recognition of indigenous Australians in 
the constitution.  
</p>
<p>14. Germany and Switzerland indicated that while they did not have indigenous peoples 
within their borders, their foreign development policies recognized the Declaration as a 
standard for indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>15. The majority of States did not provide details on the scope and nature of their 
national implementation plans in their responses. Nor did they indicate how those laws and 
policies were developed, or whether they had been developed in consultation with 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy or other measures adopted especially to implement the 
rights in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. All the rights in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>16. On 7 November 2007, the Plurinational State of Bolivia passed Law No. 3760 on the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In its response to the 
questionnaire, Bolivia provided extensive information on laws and programmes that are 
relevant to the implementation of the Declaration, including in the areas of education and 
languages, communications and media, housing, economic policies, food security, land and 
agricultural development, justice and women&#8217;s rights in the administration of justice, 
human rights, land, water, consultation processes, decolonization and processes to reduce 
patriarchy. 
</p>
<p>17. Chile also provided a comprehensive overview of measures to implement the rights 
set out in the Declaration, focusing on the five areas noted in paragraph 11 above. Those 
measures ranged from laws to policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p>18. In 2011, the Congo passed law No. 5-2011 for the promotion and protection of the 
rights of indigenous peoples, which incorporates the fundamental principles of the 
Declaration. The law addresses many areas, including consultation, the right of indigenous 
peoples to administer their internal affairs and have recourse to traditional customs to 
resolve internal conflicts, the protection of customs and traditional institutions, intellectual 
property relating to traditional knowledge, the protection of sacred sites, education and 
individual and collective property rights. 
</p>
<p>19. The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples of Mexico 
has as one of its principal objectives the harmonization of federal and state-level laws with 
respect to the rights of indigenous peoples. It has referenced the Declaration in its work in 
this area. 
</p>
<p>20. The &#8220;Closing the gap&#8221; strategy in Australia sets benchmarks for ending educational 
disadvantage for indigenous children, which Australia believes is a key priority area for the 
implementation of the Declaration.  </p>


<p>21. The rights contained in the Declaration are addressed in the national constitution and 
the Statute on Indigenous Peoples of Paraguay. The Declaration is also used as a guiding 
framework in the policies and programmes of the Institute of Indigenous Affairs.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Self-determination and autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>22. As a result of amendments made to the constitution in 2001, Mexico recognizes the 
self-determination and collective rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>23. Several States identified legislation that recognized the right of indigenous peoples 
to autonomy. Most of the legislative provisions recognizing or creating indigenous 
autonomous areas require indigenous peoples to vote in favour of becoming autonomous. 
Indigenous jurisdiction over such autonomous areas varies. Some States indicated that 
autonomous areas used the laws and institutions of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>24. The Plurinational State of Bolivia has begun a process of recognizing the autonomy 
of indigenous communities. Several communities have voted in favour of autonomy and 
have begun the process of developing a statute for autonomy, with technical support from 
the Ministry of Autonomy. The process recognizes the need for the equal participation of 
women in governance structures. 
</p>
<p>25. Burkina Faso has also begun a process of decentralization through its law No. 055-
2004/AN. This law entrenches the right of territories to govern themselves and to manage 
their own affairs to promote their own development and reinforce local governance. This 
decentralization process has transferred jurisdiction in socioeconomic and cultural matters. 
</p><p>26. The law in the Congo guarantees indigenous peoples the right to administer their 
internal affairs and to have recourse to their customs to resolve internal conflicts. The law 
also protects the customs and traditional institutions of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>27. The constitution of Guyana established its Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Commission, which 
is one of five commissions dealing with constitutional rights. The objective of the 
Commission is to &#8220;establish mechanisms to enhance the status of indigenous peoples and to 
respond to their legitimate demands and needs&#8221;. As part of its mandate, it offers 
recommendations on the participation of indigenous peoples in national decision-making 
and other decisions that affect their lives.  The Amerindian Act 2006 provides for village 
councils to govern their internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>28. Denmark passed the Act on Greenland Self-Government in 2009. Under the 
preamble, the people of Greenland are recognized as a people under international law with 
the right to self-determination. The current Government of Greenland is democratically 
elected  and all the current members of parliament and of the Government are of Inuit 
descent. 
</p>
<p>29. The constitution of Finland recognizes the right of self-government of the Sami 
people and that they have linguistic and cultural self-government in their native region. The 
Act on the Sami Parliament regulates the implementation of the system of self-government.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation in decision-making, including the obligation to seek to obtain the free, 
prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>30. Most States provided information on legislative and policy measures to implement 
the right to participate in decision-making. There were two aspects to the information 
provided: participation in national decision-making and consultation on decisions affecting 
the rights of indigenous peoples. </p>


<p>31. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, indigenous peoples are represented in 
legislative bodies. In Burkina Faso, there are elected Peul and Touareg representatives in 
parliament and ministers in the Government. 
</p>
<p>32. In the Congo, legislation ensures the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-
making. Peru has also passed a law on the right to prior consultation, as recognized in 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, which was promulgated on 23 
August 2011. 
</p>
<p>33. France indicated that in its department of French Guiana an advisory board of 
Amerindians and Bushinengu&#233; was established in 2010. The regional councils and the 
general council consult this board on any plans or proposals which may affect the 
environment or the cultural activities of the Amerindians and Bushinengu&#233;. 
</p>
<p>34. Chile undertook a consultation on indigenous institutions, which was modified after 
it received complaints from indigenous leaders about the process. The first stage of 
consultation is now aimed at developing consultation procedures. 
</p>
<p>35. In 2005 the Government of Norway and the Sami Parliament concluded an 
agreement on procedures for consultations to ensure that new measures and legal provisions 
were in accordance with the rights of the Sami peoples. The procedures for consultation 
also seek to ensure that the Sami peoples can genuinely participate in, and have a real 
influence on, decision-making processes that may directly affect Sami interests. By royal 
decree, the Government has confirmed that the agreed procedures apply to the whole 
central government administration. Norway states that the right to self-determination is 
primarily exercised through the right to participate in decision-making relating to matters 
only applying to the Sami and a right to participate in the public administration affecting 
both the Sami and the community at large. The obligation to consult arising from these 
rights is implemented through procedures established between the State authorities and the 
Sami Parliament in accordance with ILO Convention No. 169.  
</p>
<p>36. The Finnish Act on the Sami Parliament includes an obligation to negotiate with the 
Sami Parliament on various issues, including community planning; the management use, 
leasing and assignment of State lands, conservation areas and wilderness areas; applications 
for licences to stake mining claims; legislative or administrative changes to the occupations 
belonging to the Sami culture; the development of the teaching of and in the Sami language 
in schools and its use in the social and health services; or any other matters affecting the 
Sami language and culture and the status of the Sami as an indigenous people. The 
obligation to negotiate applies to all levels of the administration.  
</p>
<p>37. In Guyana, the titling and demarcation of Amerindian lands and territories requires 
their free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>38. Australia has an indigenous engagement framework which, it states, captures its 
aspirations to engage effectively with indigenous peoples. The National Congress of 
Australia&#8217;s First Peoples provides a voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 
in strategic national matters. Australia has also established the Prime Minister&#8217;s Indigenous 
Advisory Council, which provides advice on emerging policy issues arising in indigenous 
affairs. The Council is made up of indigenous and non-indigenous individuals. 
</p>
<p>39. In the United States, pursuant to executive order 13175 on &#8220;Consultation and 
coordination with Indian tribal governments&#8221;, federal agencies are required to consult with 
tribal officials when making decisions that affect tribal communities. 
</p>
<p>40. The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples in Mexico 
has established a system for consultation with indigenous peoples which allows for their </p>


<p>participation in the definition, design, implementation and evaluation of programmes, 
projects and government actions. 
</p><p>41. Peru has passed a law on the right to consultation, under which the purpose of a 
consultation is agreement between the State and indigenous peoples. Based on this law, a 
methodological guide has been developed with technical assistance from ILO and the 
United Nations Development Programme.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Culture and languages 
</b></p>
<p>42. In the responses of States, there were examples of indigenous languages being 
recognized in State constitutions. However, the most common response was to highlight the 
importance of education in promoting and implementing the rights to culture and language 
of indigenous peoples. There were a few examples of indigenous languages being taught in 
national schools and a few States explicitly indicated that school curricula were developed 
in consultation with indigenous peoples. Some States indicated a need to overcome 
negative stereotypes of indigenous cultures and languages in order to preserve and promote 
their use. 
</p>
<p>43. The Bolivian education system has been undergoing changes, based on an ideology 
and political practice of decolonization, liberation, revolution, anti-imperialism and 
transformation without discrimination or exploitation. The revamped education system 
provides cultural education, which contributes to the affirmation and strengthening of 
cultural identities, recognition, assessment and development of the cultures of indigenous 
peoples in dialogue with other cultures and language. The Bolivian constitution provides 
for education to begin in the mother tongue of each region. It also provides for the creation 
of indigenous universities. 
</p>
<p>44. In Peru, the Declaration was explicitly invoked by the Minister of Education in 
connection with the creation of the National Commission on Intercultural Bilingual 
Education. Peru has also passed a law on intercultural bilingual education, which aims to 
recognize cultural diversity and promote intercultural bilingual education in regions 
inhabited by indigenous peoples. Peruvian law also recognizes and guarantees the right of 
indigenous peoples to equal educational conditions. The Minister of Education is to design 
and implement a national plan for intercultural bilingual education. Indigenous peoples are 
to participate in the formulation and implementation of these education programmes. Peru 
has also developed a capacity-building programme for interpreters participating in 
consultation processes.  
</p>
<p>45. Chile has identified programmes for the teaching and learning of indigenous 
languages and cultures in the nation&#8217;s schools. The Constitution of Guyana provides 
protection of the right of indigenous peoples &#8220;to protection, preservation and promulgation 
of their languages, cultural heritage and way of life&#8221;. The Constitution of Iraq guarantees an 
Iraqi individual&#8217;s right to education in his or her mother tongue. 
</p>
<p>46. The Constitution of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic recognizes the Lao 
language as the official language and dialect of the country. However, in day-to-day life 
each ethnic group is free to preserve and use its dialect in the family and the community for 
the preservation of their culture and traditions. 
</p>
<p>47. In the Congo, the law guarantees the collective and individual rights of indigenous 
peoples to their intellectual property relating to traditional knowledge. The law also protects 
cultural, religious and spiritual property. 
</p>
<p>48. The Finnish Sami Language Act regulates the right of the Sami to use their own 
language before the courts and other authorities. The Act also obliges the public authorities 
to enforce and promote the linguistic rights of the Sami.  </p>


<p>49. In Trinidad and Tobago, in 2011 the Government approved the grant of 25 acres of 
land for the creation of an Amerindian heritage village to protect Amerindian culture and 
traditions. 
</p>
<p>50. El Salvador is currently working on a constitutional amendment to recognize 
indigenous peoples and adopt policies to maintain and develop ethnic and cultural identity, 
values and spirituality. It invests in educational initiatives for the revitalization of 
indigenous languages, including diplomas in intercultural bilingual education for teachers. 
The development and implementation of these programmes is carried out in consultation 
with indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>51. Several States, including Chile and Guyana, indicated that their constitutions 
provide for non-discrimination and equality.  
</p>
<p>52. Some States indicated that the principle of equality prohibited States from treating 
any one group differently from another group. The constitution of the Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic stipulates that all citizens are equal before the law. According to the 
Government, in accordance with the principle of equality, every ethnic group is special and 
therefore no one is more special than any other group, which has contributed to peace and 
harmony and solidarity among the multi-ethnic Lao peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Lands, territories and resources 
</b></p>
<p>53. Several States mentioned processes under way to demarcate and provide title over 
the lands of indigenous peoples. A few States referenced the collective nature of those 
titles. Several States indicated that indigenous peoples had certain governmental authority 
or jurisdiction over their lands. 
</p><p>54. The Plurinational State of Bolivia is strengthening the process of land redistribution 
and community self-management. It has also published an atlas of indigenous territories. 
Chile has relaunched mechanisms to transfer land to indigenous peoples under transparent 
and objective conditions. The collective property rights of indigenous peoples in the Congo 
are protected by law. 
</p>
<p>55. France identified the creation of the Guiana Amazonian Park in French Guiana as 
providing protection to indigenous peoples in the area to maintain and preserve their 
subsistence practices, as well as preserving the natural resources they exploit. 
</p>
<p>56. In Guyana, the constitution of 2003 provides protection for property, including 
Amerindian property. Under the Amerindian Act 2006, Amerindians are granted title to 
their lands absolutely and for ever. Titling and demarcation of Amerindian villages must 
occur with their free, prior and informed consent. Those lands and resources are governed 
by village councils, who have rule-making powers governing &#8220;the management, use, 
preservation, protection and conservation of village lands and resources or any part 
thereof&#8221;. There has been an increase in the percentage of Amerindian land which has been 
titled and demarcated. 
</p>
<p>57. New Zealand respects the importance of the relationship of the Maori peoples with 
their land and resources, but also maintains the existing legal regimes for ownership and 
management of land and natural resources. 
</p>
<p>58. The Peruvian constitution protects the rights to land and there is a process for the 
recognition and entitlement of such lands. </p>


<p>59. El Salvador recognizes the damage caused by the disintegration of indigenous 
communities stemming from changes in land use and has begun to address those issues 
through the Vice-Ministry of Housing and Urban Development.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States 
</b></p>
<p>60. New Zealand indicated that the Treaty of Waitangi is the foundational document for 
the relationship between the Government and the Maori. New Zealand is committed to 
settling outstanding treaty grievances by 2014. New Zealand indicated that increased 
resources and funding are being provided to continue the settlement process. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consideration of the Declaration when devising new laws and policies 
</b></p>
<p>61. There were no responses containing information on States having passed explicit 
laws requiring consideration of the Declaration when new laws, policies or other measures 
are being devised. However, there are examples where the goals and principles of the 
Declaration have informed processes leading to new laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>62. Several States have formalized processes and enacted legislation requiring the 
participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making. Those laws generally require prior 
consultation when States make decisions that directly affect the rights of indigenous 
peoples. Some States made specific reference to the requirement of free, prior and informed 
consent in relevant laws and policies and many States indicated that measures requiring 
consultation were developed in consultation with indigenous peoples. There were a few 
examples of consultation occurring through the institutions and decision-making processes 
of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>63. The law on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples of the 
Congo was elaborated through a process which allowed for public participation, including 
governmental actors, civil society and international experts. Indigenous peoples were 
consulted in their localities in all departments where there is a significant concentration of 
indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples also played an active role in the discussions leading 
to the final draft of the legislation. 
</p>
<p>64. Consultation with indigenous peoples in the Plurinational State of Bolivia forms part 
of the principles of openness and transparency promoted by the Government. There are 
several laws in place that require consultation with indigenous peoples and their 
participation in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>65. The Indigenous Act of Chile recognizes and safeguards indigenous peoples and their 
lands, as well as recognizing indigenous institutions and cultures. The Act provides special 
measures for the practical application of the obligations of consultation and participation. It 
recognizes that indigenous peoples should be consulted through their traditional 
organizations, as well as those communities, organizations and associations recognized 
under the Indigenous Act. In one instance, when indigenous peoples expressed concern 
about the process used for consultation, the Government adjusted the process for discussing 
new indigenous institutions and constitutional recognition. 
</p>
<p>66. In Guyana, the Amerindian Law 2006 requires the free, prior and informed consent 
of Amerindian villagers on issues that require their involvement or support in relation to 
land or mining, titling and demarcating lands, entry and access to Amerindian villages and 
use of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>67. In New Zealand, one example of Maori participation in decision-making occurs 
through negotiated agreements for the co-management of resources, such as conservation 
lands owned by the crown and national parks. Additionally, recent jurisprudence concluded </p>


<p>that the common law should be developed consistently with emerging human rights norms 
and the Treaty of Waitangi. 
</p>
<p>68. Peru has enacted a law that recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to prior 
consultation on legislative or administrative measures that directly affect their collective 
rights in the areas of physical existence, cultural identity, territory, education, health, 
quality of life and the development of their peoples. That law also extends to national and 
regional plans, programmes and development projects that directly affect the rights of 
indigenous peoples. The regulations of this Act are being drafted with the participation of 
various government agencies and representatives of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>69. Several States indicated that, based on the principle of the formal equality of all 
citizens, there is no law that provides special recognition or processes for indigenous 
peoples to participate in decision-making. In Burkina Faso, the decentralization law takes 
into account the considerations set out in the Declaration. However, Burkina Faso does not 
wish to create a hierarchy among populations within the State and thus does not explicitly 
consider the Declaration when devising new laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>70. The &#8220;Closing the gap&#8221; strategy in Australia has been established with the long-term 
goal of meeting the provisions of a range of other articles in the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>71. The human rights strategy of the German Federal Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development makes explicit reference to the Declaration and the principle 
of free, prior and informed consent as essential landmarks which need to be adhered to in 
any planning of development measures which might affect indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>72. In Norway there are several ministries responsible for the implementation of its 
human rights obligations. Those ministries must take into account relevant international 
obligations when laws, policies or other measures affecting indigenous peoples are being 
developed. The national legal framework requires the involvement of those affected when 
regulations are issued, amended or repealed.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives to raise awareness of the Declaration at community and 
government levels 
</b></p>
<p>73. The responses received from States indicated several direct measures to raise 
awareness of the Declaration. Some States indicated a preference for focusing awareness-
raising campaigns on general human rights instruments, such as national laws or human 
rights treaties. Awareness-raising initiatives were aimed at both Governments and 
indigenous peoples. One State emphasized the importance of indigenous peoples knowing 
their rights and Governments knowing the Declaration. There were some examples of 
education and training on the rights of indigenous peoples forming part of awareness-
raising initiatives. 
</p>
<p>74. The Mexican Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has 
disseminated the Declaration within the Government and been instrumental in its 
translation into 18 indigenous languages. Norway has also translated the Declaration into 
Norwegian and North Sami. El Salvador has translated the Declaration into the Nahuat 
language as part of its dictionary and grammar book. Paraguay has translated the 
declaration into Guaran&#237; and has disseminated it widely, particularly among staff of the 
judicial branch.  
</p><p>75. The Congo has focused awareness-raising on national and international human 
rights and rights instruments for indigenous peoples. During &#8220;parliamentary days&#8221;, efforts 
were made to educate Congolese parliamentarians on the rights of indigenous peoples and 
the Declaration was explained to them. </p>


<p>76. The Ministry of External Relations of the Plurinational State of Bolivia developed a 
series of workshops with the ILO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean 
entitled &#8220;The scope of ILO Convention 169: challenges for application and implementation 
and strategies for action&#8221;. Those workshops were directed at officials, public servants and 
indigenous peoples. Materials on collective rights have also been created and distributed. 
</p>
<p>77. Chile has a programme entitled &#8220;Strengthening national capacities for conflict 
prevention and intercultural management in Chile&#8221;, which includes support for activities to 
disseminate information and training related to the rights of indigenous peoples as 
recognized by international law, with an emphasis on ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>78. France indicated that it had an ambassador for human rights and that on the 
International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples, round tables were organized and 
cultural events were held in French Guiana. 
</p>
<p>79. Following the enactment of the Amerindian Act in Guyana, there was a recognized 
need for education and awareness-raising for village councils and community members. 
Several training programmes have been conducted and a brochure entitled &#8220;The 
Amerindian Act made simple&#8221; was published and distributed to all community leaders and 
members. The Government of Guyana also undertakes capacity-building programmes and 
workshops for government employees. In addition, indigenous leaders can seek 
clarification of the Amerindian law during the biennial meetings of the village captains. 
</p>
<p>80. In conjunction with the National Congress of Australia&#8217;s First Peoples, the 
Australian Human Rights Commission, held &#8220;Declaration dialogue&#8221; meetings with 
indigenous communities in 2013 and 2014 to raise awareness of the Declaration. The 
national human rights institution of Australia developed an overview, a community guide 
and a poster on the Declaration, which sought to highlight practical examples of how the 
Declaration can benefit indigenous Australians.  
</p>
<p>81. A few States indicated that, while they were not taking action to promote the 
Declaration, information on the Declaration was distributed by other organizations within 
the State. With the announcement of support for the Declaration, there was widespread 
publicity for it in New Zealand. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission has 
translated it into <i>te reo Maori</i> and has publicized its content and significance. While various 
organizations in Peru have produced materials, there is no national campaign to assist 
understanding of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>82. Some States expressed hesitation about directly promoting the Declaration and the 
rights of indigenous peoples. Burkina Faso noted that its national cultural policy promoted 
principles of respect, but did not indicate any measures to promote the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>83. The Government of Switzerland supports two non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), which work to strengthen the negotiating capacity of indigenous delegates to the 
United Nations through training courses and knowledge transfer.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges in adopting measures and implementing strategies to attain 
the goals of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>84. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of awareness and knowledge of the 
Declaration and other international instruments on the rights of indigenous peoples. One 
State indicated that this lack of knowledge was exacerbated by the lack of wider civil 
society engagement in the rights of indigenous peoples. Moreover, the rights of indigenous 
peoples are often not a priority for Governments. </p>


<p>85. A few States indicated that one challenge they had experienced was a lack of 
information on how to implement the Declaration. In particular, there was an identified 
need to improve mechanisms for dialogue and information exchange between the State and 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>86. One State cited the lack of a consensus on the meaning of terms, such as self-
determination, sovereignty and free, prior and informed consent, as an impediment to the 
practical implementation of the Declaration. One State identified the need for the 
implications of self-determination to be clarified, including how it could be implemented in 
practical policies.  
</p>
<p>87. Another main challenge identified was the cost of implementing the Declaration and 
the limited resources available to undertake this work. Funds would be necessary in order to 
implement different strategies to meet the objectives of the Declaration. Specifically, the 
cost of land demarcation and titling was identified. One State indicated that the remoteness 
of indigenous communities posed challenges to access to, and timely delivery of, goods and 
services, as well the prohibitive costs of delivering those goods and services. In addition, 
there were challenges in preserving and publishing materials in all of the many indigenous 
languages that might exist within a single State. 
</p>
<p>88. Another challenge identified was the need for regional variances in implementation. 
Specifically, the policies of each Government were not organized in the same manner. 
Moreover, each indigenous people had its own history, culture, needs and perspectives.  
</p>
<p>89. One State indicated that it was a challenge to develop national legislation. Further, 
there was a need to incorporate and implement international commitments in public 
policies. One State also expressed concern because there was a need to ensure that policies 
developed for indigenous peoples also contributed to the development of society in general. 
</p>
<p>90. One State indicated that it was a challenge to ensure consistency across the states of 
a federation, owing to the constitutional division of legislative powers between federal and 
state Governments.  
</p>
<p>91. A major challenge that was discussed was in relation to the monitoring and 
enforcement of laws, particularly mining and forestry laws. One State indicated that it was 
a challenge to prevent unethical foreign researchers and NGOs from misappropriating the 
intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>92. Some States did not identify any challenges but rather reiterated the rights enjoyed 
by indigenous peoples within the State. 
</p>
<p>93. One State indicated that government programmes and policies were not enough to 
attain the goals of the Declaration and underlined the need for the indigenous community to 
be more engaged. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>94. In their responses, States indicated many measures and best practices for 
implementing the Declaration. To fully realize the goals of the Declaration, Governments 
needed to commit to an ongoing implementation process and continue building on 
achievements. Implementation of the Declaration would need to respond to the 
particularities and historical and cultural backgrounds of the indigenous peoples concerned. 
States that did not have indigenous peoples within their borders could use the Declaration 
as a framework for development assistance.  
</p>
<p>95. Where treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements already existed, 
those instruments could provide the foundation for partnership, mutual respect, cooperation </p>


<p>and good faith between States and indigenous peoples. As stated in the response of France, 
the Noum&#233;a Accord between France and the Kanaks of New Caledonia recognized the 
harmful effects of colonization, returned confiscated land to the indigenous peoples, 
provided full participation of the Kanak people in decision-making and established a 
consultation process. 
</p>
<p>96. Chile noted that its approach to hold regional round tables for a &#8220;historic reunion&#8221; 
was an example of a process to create a national plan to attain the goals of the Declaration. 
Government, churches, civil society organizations and indigenous representatives took part 
in the round tables. The goals were to build trust and identify topics of importance to 
indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>97. States used a variety of constitutional, legislative and policy measures to implement 
the Declaration, including drafting new legislation, amending existing legislation, creating 
new programmes and initiatives, and increasing involvement in international indigenous 
issues. This multipronged approach might include adopting a special law recognizing the 
rights of indigenous peoples, which had been developed with the effective participation of 
indigenous peoples based on the principle of free, prior and informed consent. It might also 
require legal recognition of indigenous peoples, including ratifying ILO Convention No. 
</p><p>169. 
</p>
<p>98. The Plurinational State of Bolivia, in particular, demonstrated good practices 
regarding gender equality by recognizing the need to ensure that programmes specifically 
targeted and benefited indigenous women. As part of its strategy to address violence against 
indigenous women, the national plan of Australia included strengthening indigenous 
communities through fostering the leadership of indigenous women within communities 
and the broader Australian society.  
</p>
<p>99. Paraguay highlighted the importance of regularizing the communal ownership of 
land and of supporting the access of indigenous peoples to sustainable livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>100. States could work with United Nations agencies to improve the situation of indigenous 
peoples substantially, especially if those agencies provided technical assistance. Chile 
identified the need for ongoing support by the international community in the implementation 
of strategies to achieve the goals of the Declaration, especially in studying and publicizing 
best practices to assist States in so doing. Norway demonstrated good practice by responding 
to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
(A/HRC/18/35/Add.2), indicating how the Government planned to follow up on the 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>101. Many States pointed to the relationship between the Declaration and other 
international human rights treaties in the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, including ILO Convention No. 169, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms.  
</p>
<p>102. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples had supported the Congo in the 
adoption of a special law for indigenous peoples. Technical assistance from the 
international community, including information and capacity-building, would, in the 
opinion of some States, significantly improve implementation. 
</p>
<p>103. To attain the goals of the Declaration, States had promoted capacity-building for 
indigenous peoples. Further, they had encouraged efforts to strengthen the institutions of 
indigenous peoples, NGOs and self-government structures. There was also a recognized 
need to provide opportunities for indigenous peoples to participate as equal partners in the </p>


<p>overall development process of their country. Australia pursued a policy of focusing on 
addressing indigenous disadvantage in areas such as education, health services, community 
development and community safety. 
</p>
<p>104. States also identified best practices in the area of education and promoting the 
languages and cultures of indigenous peoples. It was important to include indigenous 
languages within the education system and develop strategies for implementing bilingual 
and intercultural education with the participation of indigenous peoples. In addition, 
cultural centres could be created to promote indigenous cultures. Finally, some States 
recognized indigenous languages as official languages. 
</p>
<p>105. To attain the goals of the Declaration, some States indicated that a special budget for 
consultation with indigenous peoples had been created. Other States provided funds to 
address issues facing urban indigenous peoples and undertake studies on employability. To 
this end, States indicated that international financial institutions would need to aid 
developing countries throughout the implementation process. 
</p>
<p>106. Norway cited the development of more sustainable policies as a result of 
consultations between the S&#225;mediggi and the Norwegian Government as a best practice.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Responses from indigenous peoples, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overarching implementation strategies  
</b></p>
<p>107. A number of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations indicated that they had developed 
strategies to implement the Declaration. In some cases, organizations, such as the 
Community for the Advancement of Native Studies and the San Support Organizations&#8217; 
Association of Namibia, had themselves been created specifically as an implementation 
strategy. The Aldet Centre noted the establishment of Genetic Resources, Traditional 
Knowledge and Folklore International, which focused on the implementation of the Nagoya 
Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits 
Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity and World 
Intellectual Property Organization instruments on intellectual property and genetic 
resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.  
</p>
<p>108.  The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
noted that it had developed an overarching strategy to attain the goals of the Declaration, 
basing its activities on the rights of indigenous peoples to equality and self-determination. 
One activity had included promoting the creation of a parliament of Qollana Aymara and 
Quechua peoples across the Peruvian, Chilean and Bolivian borders to develop transborder 
relationships. 
</p>
<p>109. Although it had not adopted an overall written strategy for the implementation of the 
Declaration, the Sami Parliament of Norway reported that it had been engaged in its 
implementation on a daily basis since its adoption in 2007. 
</p>
<p>110. Some organizations focused on awareness-raising among indigenous communities 
and their leadership, the legal community, academics and the wider society. The Indigenous 
Bar Association had pursued this objective by hosting workshops, posting material for 
accessible online use and producing an article on experiences of implementation in Canada. 
The Association cited the Declaration in all its advocacy work. The Naga Women&#8217;s Union 
and Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights had developed implementation strategies to 
translate the Declaration into indigenous languages and awareness-raising campaigns. The </p>


<p>National Indian Youth Council reported on its advocacy work among urban indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>111. Some indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted that their implementation strategies 
included engagement with the United Nations system, in some instances bringing cases 
before treaty bodies and in others participating actively in international activities and 
mechanisms related to the rights of indigenous peoples, such as the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the universal periodic review and the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to secure compliance with the goals of the 
Declaration.  
</p>
<p>112. The primary strategy of the National Native Title Council was to advocate for 
Governments and other organizations to reference actively the principles and goals of the 
Declaration. This process entailed, inter alia, the inclusion of indigenous representation in 
relevant legislative, policy and administrative processes, the promotion of the principle of 
free, prior and informed consent for traditional land owners and making agreements on 
issues and developments affecting traditional lands and territories.  
</p>
<p>113. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations indicated that strategies to implement the 
Declaration were in place, but did not describe them in detail, while several others noted 
that that they did not have specific strategies.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific legal, policy or other measures to implement the rights in the 
Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>114. In some cases, indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations were not aware of any measures 
adopted by their respective national Governments to implement the Declaration. Several 
organizations noted that they had made efforts, without success, to encourage States to 
adopt specific measures for implementation.  
</p>
<p>115. One organization noted that the national Government was preparing legislation that 
would address indigenous issues and that indigenous peoples were being consulted, 
however, the process was considered to be inconsistent with the Declaration. The proposed 
bill did not mention the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>116. In terms of measures taken by indigenous Governments, while the Declaration was 
not mentioned specifically in the resolution of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe that created the 
Community for the Advancement of Native Studies, the work of the organization was 
intended to implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p><b>  Self-determination and autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>117.  The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
noted that the 15 annual assemblies of the parliament of the Qollana Aymara people of the 
Andes had been held in accordance with the form of self-government as envisioned under 
the <i>ayllu-marka</i> system. Practising traditional forms of governance provided guarantees for 
its continuity, even where it was not recognized by States.  
</p>
<p><b>  Participation in decision-making, including the obligation to seek to obtain the free, 
prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>118. One organization noted evidence of the lack of commitment by the Government to 
upholding the principle of free, prior and informed consent, citing the example of the 
development by the State of a plan that, although set out as a strategy to attain the goals of 
the Declaration, was flawed. In particular, the free, prior and informed consent of </p>


<p>indigenous peoples was not sought for aspects of policies that would most directly impact 
them.  
</p>
<p><b>  Culture and languages 
</b></p>
<p>119. The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
noted its efforts to advance the use of Aymara language in some Chilean municipal schools 
to revitalize traditional culture.  
</p>
<p><b>  Non-discrimination and equality  
</b></p>
<p>120. The Centro de Promoci&#243;n y Desarrollo Rural Amaz&#243;nico noted that it was working 
to promote equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the hiring of indigenous health 
technicians by the regional health directorate of Ucayali, Peru. Its efforts to do so were 
consistent with the Declaration and with technical standards regarding the mainstreaming of 
intercultural approaches to health, particularly with regard to those health practitioners 
working in indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Lands, territories and resources 
</b></p>
<p>121. The National Native Title Council noted its advocacy for the Government of 
Australia to enshrine the principles of the Declaration in the development of the Murray 
Darling Basin plan, especially with regard to the right of indigenous peoples to maintain 
and strengthen their distinctive relationship with their lands, territories, waters, coastal seas 
and other resources. In relation to the plan, the Council, together with its partners, was also 
undertaking the national cultural flows research project, which incorporated the principles 
of the Declaration, especially article 32, paragraph 1. 
</p>
<p><b>  Treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States 
</b></p>
<p>122. The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
noted its sponsorship of the Awuayala Tribunal of Justice, a body whose decisions, while 
not binding, appealed to the conscience and reasoning of humanity. The Tribunal, hosted by 
the Kallawaya Nation in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, held its first hearing in June 
2012 to hear the demand of the Jacha Suyu Pakajaki Nation to reclaim territories taken on 
the basis of the doctrine of discovery. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consideration of the Declaration when devising new laws and policies 
or other measures that affect indigenous individuals 
</b></p>
<p>123. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations reported that the Declaration was not 
routinely taken into account in State efforts to devise laws, policies or other measures that 
affect indigenous peoples. In some cases, this was attributed to the lack of recognition of 
indigenous peoples in the country or the view that indigenous peoples were an impediment 
to development. In some cases indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations had made unsuccessful 
efforts to encourage States to adopt specific legal, policy and other measures to implement 
the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>124. A number of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted their own use of the 
Declaration as a basis for setting standards and in advocacy. The Sami Parliament of 
Norway, for example, used the Declaration and other international standards on a daily 
basis in its work. The National Indian Youth Council incorporated the declaration 
systematically in its discourse and work. </p>


<p>125. The Community for the Advancement of Native Studies noted that its activities were 
aimed at working with native nations, communities and organizations in identifying, 
prioritizing, formulating and implementing projects in accordance with their will, priorities 
and concerns. Going forward, it intended to explicitly insert, whenever feasible, the 
Declaration into its work.  
</p>
<p>126. The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
was leading processes to rebuild traditional forms of self-government, advocate for the 
respect of free, prior and informed consent, adopt measures aimed at strengthening Andean 
cultures and intercultural education, protect traditional lands, territories and resources and 
collective property and open spaces for traditional justice. In this work, it explicitly cited 
the Declaration and ILO Convention No. 169.  
</p>
<p>127. The Naga Women&#8217;s Union and Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights stated 
that the Declaration was a source of strength and power to claim their rights as indigenous 
peoples. However, the Declaration was not especially mentioned in collective decisions of 
the Naga people, as collective approaches to decision-making reflected traditional practice.  
</p>
<p>128. The Native Indian Youth Council had developed a specific policy of advocating for 
the inclusion of urban indigenous peoples in attaining the goals of Declaration. The 
organization consciously cited the Declaration within its advocacy efforts. 
</p>
<p>129. The National Native Title Council followed the Declaration within its own work and 
practices. It noted that its policy submissions referred to principles in the Declaration, 
particularly those related to free, prior and informed consent and self-determination.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives to raise awareness of the Declaration at community and 
government levels 
</b></p>
<p>130. Indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations described a number of measures taken or under 
way to raise awareness regarding the Declaration. Activities focused particularly on 
translation and dissemination of the Declaration and on carrying out training and holding 
workshops. Some organizations noted financial constraints on awareness-raising activities. 
</p>
<p>131. The Aldet Centre had initiated discussions with State officials to make them more 
sensitive to the Declaration and had also disseminated and publicized the content of 
Declaration in both English and the Kw&#233;y&#242;l language.  
</p>
<p>132. The Botswana Khwedom Council noted its use of the Declaration as a point of 
reference in the workshops it organized and in discussions with the national Government.  
</p>
<p>133. The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos 
emphasized the importance of dissemination of the Declaration and reported that it had led 
workshops and seminars about it, noting that there was wide demand among indigenous 
peoples for such capacity-building tools. However, it expressed concerns about providing 
those workshops, due to a lack of financial resources. The Centro de Promoci&#243;n y 
Desarrollo Rural Amaz&#243;nico also noted that it was not able to disseminate the Declaration 
on a large scale due to a lack of financial resources.  
</p>
<p>134. The Community for the Advancement of Native Studies recently began efforts to 
raise awareness of the Declaration at various levels of the community and of government to 
enhance the prospects for its implementation. </p>


<p>135. The International Bar Association published &#8220;Understanding and implementing the 
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: an introductory handbook&#8221;,2 which 
explained the Declaration in thematic clusters and concluded with information on 
implementation and additional resources. The handbook had been shared with national and 
provincial authorities, treaty relations commissions, human rights commissions and some 
domestic courts and had been distributed at a series of workshops conducted across Canada 
for lawyers, educators, community leaders and human rights workers.  
</p>
<p>136. Initiatives taken by the Naga Women&#8217;s Union and Naga Peoples Movement for 
Human Rights to raise awareness of the Declaration included the organization of training 
sessions, workshops, seminars, meetings and community consultations on the Declaration, 
human rights and United Nations mechanisms. That process included translation and 
dissemination of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>137. The National Khoi-San Council had conducted various workshops relating to the 
Declaration with indigenous leaders and community representatives in different parts of 
South Africa, through institutions such as the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating 
Committee. It was also noted that the Declaration had been translated from English into 
Afrikaans, a language spoken widely among Khoi and San peoples. 
</p>
<p>138. The Native Indian Youth Council reported efforts to integrate the Declaration into 
its advocacy activities, as well its participation in efforts to raise and promote awareness of 
the Declaration among Navajo Nation and other tribal leaders.  
</p><p>139. The National Native Title Council worked to raise awareness of the Declaration by 
incorporating the goals and rights stated in the Declaration into submissions, interventions 
and recommendations presented to various levels of government and to stakeholders, both 
domestically and internationally. It emphasized the importance of raising awareness of the 
Declaration among indigenous peoples. The Council further worked to raise the awareness 
of Government, industry and indigenous peoples of the need for the extractive industries to 
engage more efficiently and effectively with indigenous peoples to realize their right to 
free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>140. The Programme d&#8217;Int&#233;gration et de D&#233;veloppement du Peuple Pygm&#233;e au Kivu 
reported its use of press, media, meetings and workshops to disseminate information about the 
Declaration. In particular, such efforts were intended to reach concerned indigenous peoples, 
national and local authorities, community leaders, the army, the police and civil society 
organizations. It further noted that the Declaration had not been translated into relevant 
indigenous languages, which was a key issue that should be resolved in the short term.  
</p>
<p>141. The Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation cited the use of websites, online radio 
stations and social media to raise awareness of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>142. The Sami Parliament of Norway was a technical host for the Global Indigenous 
Preparatory Conference for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly, to be 
known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held in Alta, Norway, from 10 to 12 
June 2013, which provided an opportunity to raise awareness about the rights of indigenous 
peoples and the Declaration at the local and regional levels.

<p><b> E. Challenges in adopting measures and implementing strategies to attain 
the goals of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>143. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted that there was a lack of awareness of 
the Declaration, including on the part of indigenous organizations. In some cases, this was due 
to the lack of availability of the Declaration and information about it in relevant languages. 
</p>
<p>144. One organization noted that the lack of awareness in its country related also to the 
relevance of international law at the national level. Lack of clarity in this regard was 
contributed to by a government view of the Declaration as being an aspirational document. 
This position had influenced the views of some indigenous peoples, as well as lawyers and 
members of the judiciary. 
</p><p>145. Another challenge identified was the perceived complexity of the Declaration in 
addressing the traditional dichotomy between individual and collective rights in societies. 
This was seen as a concern in terms of making the Declaration more effective and better 
understood.  
</p>
<p>146. One organization noted that the costs of raising awareness regarding the Declaration, 
which included costly travel to remote areas with dispersed populations, often fell to 
indigenous peoples and their allies.  
</p>
<p>147. One of the biggest challenges identified was a lack of political will on the part of 
States to implement the Declaration and to consider the rights of indigenous peoples more 
broadly. One organization observed slow progress from its national Government in 
capturing the essence of the principles and goals of the Declaration. In some cases, there 
was also a lack of attention paid by authorities to indigenous issues or public support for the 
rights of indigenous peoples. Several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted challenges 
with regard to, in particular, the implementation of free, prior and informed consent. In 
some cases, lack of political will also manifested itself in a lack of legislation or public 
policies directed to indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples also expressed concern 
regarding a lack of respect for indigenous land and sea rights. One organization pointed out 
that they could not fully practice their customs and traditions because their lands were 
located within a national park. 
</p>
<p>148. The problematic interpretation of the principle of equality was stated as another 
challenge in implementing the Declaration. Interpretations of equality that did not take into 
account that human rights norms accommodated, and in some cases required, special 
measures, and concerns regarding special or differential treatment of indigenous peoples, 
were used to excuse failures to implement their rights. 
</p>
<p>149.  Three indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations noted challenges relating to a lack of 
recognition of indigenous peoples in their own countries. Another noted that, although 
recognized in the country in question, indigenous peoples faced racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>150. A number of organizations expressed concern regarding their lack of inclusion and 
participation in relevant State discussions, public affairs and political processes, including 
in processes related to laws, policies and programmes. One organization observed that the 
Government was perceived to be inaccessible. It was further observed that the lack of 
inclusion of indigenous peoples in relevant discussions resulted in an avoidance of 
constructive dialogue between indigenous peoples and public authorities. Moreover, in 
some cases, there was no dialogue with indigenous peoples, even where extractive 
industries were carrying out activities on indigenous lands.  
</p>
<p>151. One organization also pointed out the lack of enforcement mechanisms likely to 
encourage States to abide by the Declaration. </p>


<p>152. Another main challenge identified was the lack of sufficient funding and resources 
for indigenous representative organizations to function effectively and promote the 
Declaration. Challenges relating to poor infrastructure and communications facilities were 
also noted.  
</p>
<p>153. In terms of challenges within indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations or institutions, one 
organization noted that the many pressures facing indigenous peoples and scepticism of the 
potential of the Declaration to effect change presented a potential barrier to its 
implementation. Some indigenous peoples expressed scepticism as to how the Declaration 
could solve the pressing daily concerns that were common in indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>154. Many indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations described measures that would constitute 
best practices for the implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>155. In terms of the role of those organizations, best practices could include taking 
initiatives to implement the Declaration by ensuring their policies, regulations and laws 
were in line with its provisions, to better educate all stakeholders on the Declaration and to 
encourage judges and lawyers to cite it in pleadings and in court. It was also noted that, 
where States lacked the will to implement the Declaration, indigenous peoples should take 
initiatives to advocate for implementation before the relevant national, regional and 
international mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>156. It was also proposed that best practices regarding appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies should include education initiatives to raise awareness of the 
Declaration. Best practices also included the capacity-building of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>157. The United Nations system could work with indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations to 
provide capacity development regarding the Declaration and to support their work and 
participation. In this regard, the United Nations was encouraged to continue to support their 
participation, including through the provision of financial assistance. Several organizations 
observed that the United Nations could play a positive role in supporting and encouraging 
States to recognize indigenous peoples and to implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>158. Best practices could also include the strengthening of links between United Nations 
institutions and grassroots communities and the strengthening of the support provided by 
United Nations institutions for such communities. It was also proposed that the Expert 
Mechanism and other relevant United Nations mechanisms collaborate with NGOs to assist 
indigenous peoples better in proposing measures and implementation strategies to attain the 
goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>159. Recommendations were also offered to the United Nations system, including that it 
evaluate in particular issues relevant to indigenous peoples during sessions of the universal 
periodic review. One organization called on United Nations mechanisms to further 
elaborate the legal principles of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>160. The National Native Title Council noted that an intensified effort to create 
awareness of the Declaration among government officials and departments was necessary 
and could yield positive results in achieving the goals of the Declaration. As an example, 
the Council noted the sensitizing of the Social Justice Commissioner of Australia to the 
Declaration and emphasized the importance of a collaborative partnership between the 
Government of Australia and indigenous peoples to develop a sustainable and empowering 
strategy that fully realized the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>161. Indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations emphasized that best practices would include the 
recognition of indigenous peoples in countries where this had not yet occurred; </p>


<p>enforcement of the Declaration and its inclusion in public policies; engagement in 
consultation processes with indigenous peoples on matters affecting their lives and 
activities; provision of support for the work of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations in 
promoting the Declaration; demilitarization; and access to justice. The Centro de 
Promoci&#243;n y Desarrollo Rural Amaz&#243;nico proposed the creation in Peru of an intercultural 
committee in charge of indigenous interests.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Concluding comments  
</b>162. <b>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples very much 
appreciates the responses of States and of indigenous peoples, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
organizations and NGOs to its questionnaire, especially because the responses can 
provide inspiration for creative strategies to implement the Declaration.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>163. <b>The majority of responses received from States provided information at a very 
general level. In particular, there was almost no information indicating the 
effectiveness of the measures taken. Most States only provided positive answers to 
questions. Negative answers would also provide greater understanding of the 
challenges States face when implementing the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>164. <b>Many States identified national legislation that recognized and protected the 
rights of indigenous peoples, which the Expert Mechanism acknowledges as a 
significant achievement. However, States did not indicate whether there were 
sufficient administrative measures in place to ensure that the legal measures result in 
effective protection of those rights.  
</b></p>
<p>165. <b>Although several States reported on sectoral initiatives to implement provisions 
of the Declaration, only a limited number of States had introduced comprehensive 
strategies or action plans for the full implementation of the Declaration. The rights 
contained in the Declaration are interdependent and interrelated and as such, their 
implementation requires comprehensive approaches and actions. 
</b></p>
<p>166. <b>While not explicitly stated in the responses to the questionnaire, some States 
appeared to perceive a struggle to balance the recognition and implementation of the 
rights of indigenous peoples, as articulated in the Declaration, and the principle of 
equality. Equality continues to be interpreted by some States as prohibiting 
specialized programmes aimed at achieving the goals of the Declaration. The Expert 
Mechanism stresses that substantive equality may require treating indigenous peoples 
as distinct groups facing unique circumstances.  
</b></p>
<p>167. <b>Some State responses suggested that they were vague about the definition of 
indigenous peoples, including in terms of distinctions between minorities and 
indigenous peoples. Some States also indicated that indigenous peoples constituted the 
numerical majority within the State and thus did not present any concern for the 
recognition of their rights, which, in the view of the Expert Mechanism, is not always 
the case. Conversely, other States indicated that no groups within the State fitted the 
definition of indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>168. <b>One challenge raised was the attempt by a few persons and NGOs to undermine 
the land titling and demarcation process by advising indigenous peoples to claim more 
lands than they traditionally occupied, reject the process of titling and demarcation 
and/or to make no request for such demarcation. Such frustration indicates that a </b></p>


<p><b>tension may exist between States, indigenous peoples and NGOs on the best approach to 
achieving the goals of the Declaration. Again, additional information by States on how 
to work through these differences to promote harmonious relations would greatly assist 
other States to continue to work towards implementation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous peoples, indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and non-
governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>169. <b>Many indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations detailed their approaches, which 
included activities at all levels, for attaining the goals of the Declaration. Most of the 
indigenous organizations which responded to the questionnaire were engaged in at least 
one of the following activities: advocacy; capacity-building, including by developing and 
disseminating resources and conducting training on the Declaration for communities, 
indigenous peoples and public authorities; conducting research regarding indigenous 
concerns; and translating the Declaration into indigenous languages.  
</b></p>
<p>170. <b>Very few organizations proposed overarching strategies at the national level. 
However, some indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations were focused mainly on thematic 
issues and, as mentioned by many organizations, their institutional activities were 
generally limited due to a lack of financial resources and to a lack of will of States to 
cooperate with indigenous peoples. Some organizations had, however, developed 
articulated activities at both the national and international levels to maximize the 
impact of their strategies with respect to implementation of the Declaration by the 
State.  
</b></p>
<p>171. <b>Most of the organizations that responded reported the integration of the spirit 
and standards of the Declaration within their internal guidelines, practices and 
activities. Several also noted that they were disposed to participate in local or national 
public processes when established in cooperation and good faith with indigenous peoples 
and organizations. Nevertheless, several alleged reluctance on the part of States to 
engage adequately or at all with indigenous peoples on matters that had an impact on 
them.  
</b></p>
<p>172. <b>Most organizations reported a lack of attention from States in considering the 
Declaration and the rights of indigenous peoples, a lack of understanding of the status 
and legal value in domestic legal systems of the Declaration and a lack of public 
support for indigenous peoples. All these concerns prevented the full implementation 
of the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>173. <b>Relevant best practices cited included asking United Nations mechanisms to 
assist indigenous peoples better in advancing implementation strategies. Nationally 
and locally, efforts, on the part of both States and indigenous peoples, were needed to 
raise awareness regarding the Declaration. 
</b></p>
