("RedStar", the "Corporation", "we", "us" or "our") issuable upon the exercise or deemed exercise of the 4,925,900 outstanding 
special share purchase warrants (the "Common Share Special Warrants") and the 9,636,800 outstanding special share purchase

The  Special  Warrants were  sold  to  investors pursuant  to  prospectus  exemptions  under  applicable  securities  legislation  through 
GMP  Securities  LP,  Blackmont  Capital  Inc.,  Canaccord  Capital  Corporation,  Orion  Securities  Inc.,  Raymond  James  Ltd., 
Acumen Capital Finance Partners Limited and Jennings Capital Inc. (collectively, the "Underwriters"). No commission or fee will
be payable by us in connection with the distribution of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Special Warrants. See 
"Plan of Distribution".
The issue price of the Common Share Special Warrants and Flow-Through Special Warrants, respectively, was determined by 
negotiations between us and the Underwriters.
An investment in the Common Shares is highly speculative due to the nature of our involvement in the exploration for, 
and  the  acquisition,  development  and  production  of,  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves.    Our  business  is  subject  to  the  risks 
normally encountered in the oil and natural gas industry.   See "Risk Factors".

"continue",  "estimate",  "expect",  "may",  "will",  "project",  "should",  "believe"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to  identify
forward-looking statements.  These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause 
actual  results  or  events  to  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated  in  such  forward-looking  statements.    We  believe  that  the 
expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions but no assurance can be given 
that  these  expectations  will  prove  to  be  correct  and  the  forward-looking  statements  included  in  this  Prospectus  should  not  be 
unduly relied upon.  These statements speak only as of the date of this Prospectus.

• 
• 
•
•
oil and natural gas production levels; 
capital expenditure programs; 
the quantity of oil and natural gas reserves; 
projections of commodity prices and costs; 
supply and demand for oil and natural gas; 
expectations regarding our ability to raise capital and to continually add to reserves through acquisitions, exploration and 
development; and 
treatment under governmental regulatory regimes and tax laws.
Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risk factors
set forth below and elsewhere in this Prospectus:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
volatility in market prices for oil and natural gas; 
liabilities inherent in oil and natural gas operations;

Readers  should  note  that  as  described  in  the  Prospectus  under  the  heading  "Amalgamation",  the  Corporation  did  not  complete  the 
Amalgamation of Pelorus and RedStar PrivateCo until August 1, 2005. 
As the Amalgamation was not completed until August 1, 2005, RedStar did not own the reserves attributable to RedStar PrivateCo,
Canadian Progress Resources Ltd. ("CPRL"), Moriah Corporation ("Moriah") and Avenir Resources (2003) Ltd. ("Resources (2003)") 
until August 1, 2005.  For clarity, prior to the completion of the Amalgamation on August 1, 2005, the reserve information attributable
to the Corporation as a stand-alone entity is set out in the table above under the heading "Pelorus". 
The  May  31,  2005  operational information  for Pelorus  changed  slightly  from  the  December  31,  2004  information:    Oil  and  NGLs 
(mbbls) = 4; Naturals Gas (bcf) = 149; and Oil Equivalent (mboe) = 29. 
The reserves information above has been presented as if the acquisition of each of these entities took place effective January 1, 2005.  
The table above was compiled using information from the following reserve reports:   
 
 
 
 
 
See  also  the  "Statement  of  Reserves  Data  and  Other  Oil  and  Gas  Information"  for  each  of  these  companies  contained  in  this 
Prospectus.
See the pricing data from each of the above mentioned reserve reports included under the headings:
–  RedStar PrivateCo – Sproule Report effective December 31, 2004;  
– CPRL – Chapman Report effective September 30, 2004;  
– Moriah – Chapman Report effective December 31, 2004;  
– Resources (2003) – Sproule Report effective March 31, 2005; and  
– Pelorus – Sproule Report effective May 31, 2005.
–  "Statement  of  Reserves  Data  and  Other  Oil  and  Gas  Information  -  RedStar  PrivateCo"  (Brownvale,  Kotcho  and  Klua
Properties);
–  "Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information - Canadian Progress Resources Ltd."; 
– "Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information - Moriah Corporation"; 
– "Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information - Avenir Resources (2003) Ltd"; and 
– "Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information - Pelorus Energy Corp.".
The reserves data for RedStar PrivateCo reflects (i) the Brownvale and Kotcho properties acquired by RedStar PrivateCo pursuant to 
an asset purchase agreement dated April 14, 2005, which transaction closed on May 3, 2005 and had an effective date of January 1,
2005; and (ii) the Klua properties acquired pursuant to the December 2004 Farmout and Option Agreement (as defined herein).  The
properties to which the reserves disclosure relates are the Brownvale, Alberta, Kotcho, British Columbia and Klua, British Columbia 
properties  formerly  held  by  RedStar  PrivateCo  (now  held  by  RedStar)  as  discussed  under  the  headings  "Principal  Properties"  and

"Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information – RedStar PrivateCo" in this Prospectus.  This reserves disclosure
specifically does not include the reserves attributed to CPRL, Moriah and Resources (2003) above.
Tax Considerations
Subscribers should consult their own professional advisors to assess the income tax, legal and other aspects of an investment in
the Corporation.  See "Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations".
RISK FACTORS
Prospective  purchasers  of  Special  Warrants  and  Common  Shares  should  carefully  consider  the  information  set  forth 
under the heading "Risk Factors" and other information set forth herein before deciding to invest in the Special Warrants 
and Common Shares.
An  investment  in  the  Special  Warrants  and  Common  Shares  should  be  considered  highly  speculative  due  to  the  nature  of  our 
involvement in the exploration for, and the acquisition, development and production of, oil and natural gas reserves.  Our business 
is subject to the risks normally encountered in the oil and natural gas industry such as:  the marketability of, and prices for, oil and 
natural  gas;  competition  with  companies  having  greater  resources;  acquisition,  exploration  and  production  risks;  the  need  for 
capital; fluctuations in the market price and demand for oil and natural gas; and regulation of the oil and natural gas industry by 
various  levels  of  government.    The  reserve  and  recovery  information  contained  in  this  Prospectus  are  estimates  only  and  the 
actual production and ultimate reserves recovered from our properties may be greater or less than the estimates contained in this
Prospectus.  The success of further exploration or development projects cannot be assured.  Investors must rely upon the ability, 
expertise, judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of our management.  See "Risk Factors".

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Funds from operations is not a recognized measure under GAAP.  Management believes that in addition to net income, funds 
from operations is a useful supplemental measure as it demonstrates our ability to generate the cash necessary to repay debt or
fund future growth through capital investment.  Investors are cautioned, however, that this measure should not be construed as an
alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as an indication of our performance.  Our method of calculating 
this  measure  may  differ  from  other  companies  and  accordingly,  they  may  not  be  comparable  to  measures  used  by  other 
companies.    For  these  purposes,  we  define  funds  from  operations  as  cash  provided  by  operations  before  changes  in  non-cash 
operating working capital.

REDSTAR OIL & GAS INC.
General
The Corporation (RedStar) was formed through the Amalgamation of Pelorus and RedStar PrivateCo on August 1, 2005.  The 
Amalgamation is more fully discussed below.
Pelorus was incorporated as Pelorus Equipment Leasing Ltd. by a Certificate of Incorporation issued pursuant to the Companies 
Act (Alberta) on June 8, 1981.  Pelorus' name was changed to PEL Equipment Leasing Ltd. by Articles of Amalgamation issued 
pursuant to the Companies Act (Alberta) on June 4, 1982.  Pelorus was continued by Articles of Continuance issued pursuant to 
the ABCA on June 16, 1983.  Pelorus' name was changed to PEL Navigation Systems  Ltd. by Articles of Amendment issued 
pursuant to the ABCA on November 1, 1984.  Pelorus' name was changed to Pelorus Navigation Systems Inc. and the Articles of 
Continuance  were  amended  by  Articles  of  Amendment  issued  pursuant  to  the  ABCA  on  September  18,  1986.    Pursuant  to  a 
reactivation  transaction,  Pelorus  subsequently  reorganized  itself  under  the  name  Pelorus  Energy  Corp.    On  August  1,  2005, 
Pelorus completed the amalgamation with RedStar PrivateCo, with the resulting issuer continuing to carry on business under the 
name "RedStar Oil & Gas Inc.".
RedStar PrivateCo was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the ABCA on September 22, 2004 as 1128882 Alberta Ltd.  On 
September 28, 2004, RedStar PrivateCo amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. On 
December 23, 2004, RedStar PrivateCo amended its articles of incorporation to designate its class A shares as common shares and
to eliminate its class B, C, D, and E shares, to create preferred shares and to eliminate the share transfer restrictions on its capital.
On August 1, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo and Pelorus completed the Amalgamation whereby each twenty-five (25) common shares 
of Pelorus were exchanged for one (1) Common Share of the amalgamated entity (RedStar) and each twenty-five (25) common 
shares of RedStar PrivateCo were exchanged for 0.75 of a Common Share of RedStar and 0.25 of a Non-Voting Share of RedStar.
Following the Amalgamation, the Common Shares and Non-Voting Shares of RedStar began trading on the TSXV on August 10, 
2005 and September 9, 2005, respectively.
Corporate Structure
RedStar has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, RedStar Limited Partnership, a holding entity which holds, at present, less than 5% 
of RedStar's oil and gas assets, and RedStar Management Ltd., which acts as a general partner of the RedStar Limited Partnership.
RedStar's head office is located at 950, 330 – 5th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 0L4 and its registered office is located at
1400, 350 – 7th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 3N9. RedStar is presently a reporting issuer in British Columbia Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Ontario and the Common Shares and Non-Voting Shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSXV.
Business Plan and Growth Strategies
THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESS
RedStar is a Calgary, Alberta based oil and natural gas exploration and production company currently producing approximately 
700 boe/d, comprised of nearly 100% natural gas.  Our focus is on our existing natural gas opportunities in Northeastern British
Columbia.  Over the next few years it is our intent to establish a portfolio of assets of varying maturity in order to increase the 
overall predictability of our cash flow stream.
With  the  proceeds  of  the  Offering,  RedStar  plans  to  complete  three  separate  3-D  seismic  programs  and  expand  its  drilling 
program by ten additional wells in the 2005/2006 winter drilling season.  The three seismic programs being shot will assist in 
selecting  additional  drilling  opportunities  for  the  2006/2007  drilling  season  as  well  as  increasing  the  chance  of  success  for  all 
drilling opportunities that are within the seismic program boundaries.  See also "Use of Proceeds".
Development of the Business
Pelorus was incorporated in 1981 and commenced operations in 1983 as a distributor of airport navigation systems. As Pelorus' 
business  evolved,  these  navigation  systems  included  Canada's  first  fully  automated  Aviation  Weather  Observation  System  for 
airports,  the  development  and  installation  of  five  Microwave  Landing  Systems  ("MLS")  and  the  development  of  a  prototype
9
airborne MLS receiver (avionics). The MLS system was superceded by the advent of the Global Positioning System ("GPS") as it 
became  the  world's  navigation  system  of  choice.  In  1988,  Pelorus  acquired  the  assets  of  a  Norway  based  company,  Delcom 
Electro A.S., whose technology Pelorus developed into a second generation Model 8900 DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) 
which  provided  the  majority  of  DME  service  in  Canadian  airspace  with  a  Transport  Canada  contract  for  domestic  airports  in 
1992. In 1987, Pelorus completed its initial public offering and began trading on The Alberta Stock Exchange, a predecessor to 
the TSXV.
In 1995 Pelorus and Honeywell International, Inc. teamed together to design, manufacture, install, maintain and market DGPS 
(Differential Global Positioning System), which was the prototype system for use in precision approach and landing of aircraft. In 
September 1998, the system was operationally certified by the United States Federal Aviation Authority for use with Continental
Airlines at the Newark International, and Minneapolis-St. Paul International airports.
In 2000,  Pelorus purchased  through  its Australian  subsidiary,  an  aerospace  division  called  Interscan  International Pty  Limited,
which  included  several  strategic  navaid  product  lines  used  in  the  South  East  Asian  marketplace.  The  product  lines  acquired 
included  DME,  Doppler  Very  High  Frequency  Omnidirectional  Radio  Range  (DVOR),  MLS  and  Tactical  Air  Navigation 
(TACAN) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) antennae. The entire Australian subsidiary and related inventories were sold 
in February 2003.
In March 2003, Honeywell International, Inc. issued a contract termination notice on the grounds a receiver was appointed over 
the assets of Pelorus. Pelorus disputed the termination notice as the receiver was released after 64 days. Honeywell International, 
Inc. settled with Pelorus in June 2004.
In November 2003, the common shares of Pelorus were delisted from the TSXV and transferred to the NEX Board of TSXV for 
failure  of  Pelorus  to  maintain  compliance  with  the  minimum  listing  requirements  of  TSXV.  The  common  shares  of  Pelorus 
subsequently resumed trading on the NEX Board of TSX Venture on June 28, 2004 under the symbol "PN.H".
On October 7, 2004 Pelorus shareholders approved the conversion of the issuer to an oil and gas company and the acquisition of 
certain oil and gas assets through two separate transactions for consideration consisting of (i) approximately $1,011,900, subject 
to adjustment, payable by the issuance of 16,865,000 common shares of Pelorus at a deemed price of $0.06 per share; and (ii) 
consideration  of  $110,000  subject  to  adjustment,  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  two  separate  acquisition  agreements  (the  "Initial 
Acquisition Agreements") between Pelorus and certain arm's length third parties.  The transactions closed in November, 2004.
This Prospectus, as well as the business acquisition report (the "BAR") for the above November 2004 acquisitions, should have 
included an audited operating statement for the assets acquired, but such operating statement has not been included in either this 
Prospectus or the BAR for the following reasons:
•
•
•
•
•
the  current  board  of  directors  and  management  of  the  Corporation,  when  agreeing  to  become  involved  with  the 
Corporation, were advised that the Corporation was up to date in all its requisite filings under applicable securities laws 
and were not aware that the Corporation was delinquent in the filing of a BAR for the November 2004 acquisitions;
the original acquisition agreements for the November 2004 acquisitions do not include either audit or review rights from 
the original vendors or royalty holders, and all the requisite information required to complete the revenue statements for 
a BAR report are not derivable from the Corporation's existing records.  The statements required for a BAR would be 
difficult to create as the pricing used in calculating the royalty income would not be possible to determine without the 
full cooperation of the vendors and/or the owners of the working interests in the properties;
the assets acquired would not have reflected any operating expenses to the Corporation, as the assets were strictly royalty 
income producing assets;
the  value  of  the  assets  acquired  through  the  November,  2004  acquisition  would  be  less  than  2%  of  the  Corporation's 
current  net  asset  value,  such  that  operating  statements  created  at  present  would  be  of  little  meaning  to  existing 
securityholders of the Corporation;
the information circular did not contain a statement of operations for the acquired properties, but did include a pro forma 
balance sheet to give effect to the completion of the acquisitions as well as a report on reserves data executed by the 
Corporation's then independent engineers;
10
•
•
in accordance with item 3.3 of the companion policy to OSC 41-501, the August 23, 2004 information circular of the 
Corporation  did  include  independent  engineering  disclosure  in  accordance  with  NI  51-101  in  respect  of  the  acquired 
properties, prepared by Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd., which included a summary of the reserve estimates and 
estimates of future net revenue and production volumes and other relevant information regarding the acquired properties; 
production volumes, prices received and royalties paid for the prior year; as well as estimated production volumes.  The 
circular also included disclosure to the effect that the principal properties were comprised principally of an overriding 
royalty interest, and that there were no exploratory or development wells or activities during the year ended December 
31, 2003 on any of the assets acquired; and
also  in  accordance  with  item  3.3  of  the  companion  policy  to  OSC  41-501,  the  Corporation  has  included  in  this 
Prospectus information with respect to the reserve estimates and estimates of future net revenues and production volumes 
from the acquired properties, actual production values from each of the properties, and estimated production volumes on 
a going forward basis.  See "Principal Properties – Gilby 7-7-41-1 W5, Hays 1-21-13-14 W4 and Verger Gas Unit No. 
1&16-7-21-13 W4 Well", see "Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information – Pelorus Energy Corp." 
and "Promoters".
Through December 2004 Pelorus completed two flow-through financings and announced a combined expenditure commitment of 
$16,500,000.
On  December  1,  2004,  RedStar  PrivateCo  entered  into  a  farm-out  and  option  agreement  (the  "December  2004  Farm-Out  and 
Option Agreement") with a major independent oil and gas producer pursuant to which RedStar was granted the right to farm-in on 
certain properties located in the Klua area of British Columbia whereby, by completing a well on the farm-out lands and paying 
100% of the costs of the same, RedStar PrivateCo would earn 100% of the farmor's working interest in the existing well spacing 
unit as well as 50% of the farmor's working interest in the balance of a block of farm-out lands associated with the earning well.
Subject to completion of the initial earning well on the terms prescribed by the agreement, RedStar PrivateCo is entitled to drill a 
further option well on an additional block of option lands and, by so doing, would earn 100% of the farmor's working interest in
the option well spacing unit as well as a 50% interest in the balance of the option lands.
Effective December 15, 2004, RedStar PrivateCo farmed into an oil and gas trust to participate in the drilling of four wells in the 
Tweedie area of northeast Alberta. RedStar PrivateCo earned a working interest in each of the four wells.
On  December  23,  2004,  RedStar  PrivateCo  issued  65,150,100  RedStar  PrivateCo  common  shares  to  founders  of  RedStar 
PrivateCo  at  a  price  of  $0.005  per  share  and  81,000,000  RedStar  PrivateCo  common  share  purchase  warrants,  each  whole 
common  share  purchase  warrant  entitling  the  holder  thereof  to  acquire  one  common  share  of  RedStar  PrivateCo  at  a  price  of 
$0.10 per share at any time prior to December 31, 2009.
On  December  23,  2004,  RedStar  PrivateCo  completed  a  private  placement  of  62,200,000  RedStar  PrivateCo  common  shares 
issued on a "flow-through" basis pursuant to the Tax Act at a price of $0.09 per share. On January 26, 2005, February 9, 2005 and 
March 31, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo issued 58,785,017, 47,052,631 and 562,857 RedStar PrivateCo common shares, respectively, 
at a price of $0.07 per share. Through these private placements, RedStar PrivateCo raised total gross proceeds of approximately
$13 million.
Effective  April  30,  2005,  pursuant  to  two  asset  transfer  agreements  (the  "CPRL  Agreement"  and  the  "Moriah  Agreement", 
respectively) between RedStar PrivateCo and each of Canadian Progress Resources Limited ("CPRL") and Moriah Corporation 
("Moriah"), RedStar PrivateCo acquired certain petroleum and natural gas property interests in the Panny area of Alberta from 
CPRL and from Moriah representing 172 mmcf or 28.7 Mboe of proven reserves (480 mmcf or 80 Mboe of proved plus probable 
reserves) and 311 mmcf or 51.8 Mboe of proven reserves (619 mmcf or 103 Mboe of proved plus probable), respectively, for 
consideration  consisting  of  11,914,285  common  shares  of  RedStar  PrivateCo  and  15,300,000  common  shares  of  RedStar 
PrivateCo,  respectively,  issued  at  a  price  of  $0.07  per  share  for  deemed  consideration  of  $834,000  and  $1,071,000.00 
respectively.  Prices were determined using the fair market value of the Panny area assets.  The oil and gas assets acquired by
RedStar  PrivateCo  effective  April 30,  2005  were  comprised  solely  of  non-producing  assets,  with  production  from  these  assets 
expected to commence in the later part of 2006.  Accordingly, it has not been possible to provide operating statements for these
acquisitions and RedStar has applied for and has received relief from the Prospectus financial statements requirements in relation 
to the above acquisitions.
Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated April 14, 2005 between RedStar PrivateCo and an arm's length major oil and gas 
producer, on May 3, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo acquired certain petroleum and natural gas production, property interests and an
11
interest  in  a  pending  farm-in  agreement  from  a  major  Canadian  oil  and  gas  producer  via  an  asset  purchase  agreement.    The 
effective date of the purchase was January 1, 2005.  The production, property interests and pending farm-in lands are located in
northeast British Columbia (Kotcho) and northwest Alberta (Brownvale).  In connection with this acquisition which closed May 
3, 2005 and was effective January 1, 2005, the properties acquired only began producing in the 2004 fiscal year and, accordingly,
the Corporation has not provided operating statements in this Prospectus for the prior periods.
Pursuant  to  an  acquisition  agreement  dated  effective  May  15,  2005  (the  "Resources  (2003)  Agreement"),  RedStar  PrivateCo 
acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Avenir Resources (2003) Ltd. ("Resources (2003)").  Through this acquisition, 
RedStar PrivateCo acquired assets located in southern Alberta with 237 mmcf and 1900 bbls of NGL's or 41.4 Mboe of proven 
reserves (301 mmcf and 2300 bbls of NGL's or 52.5 Mboe of proved plus probable reserves) through the issuance of 11,971,429 
common  shares  of  RedStar  PrivateCo  at  a  price  of  $0.07  per  share  for  aggregate  deemed  consideration  of  $838,000.    The 
properties acquired from Resources (2003) are currently producing approximately 20 bbls/d.
Pursuant to an agreement dated June 30, 2005 (the "Bowfort Agreement") between Pelorus and Bowfort Oil & Gas Ltd., a private 
oil and gas company with cash assets of $2,000,000 at that time, effective June 30, 2005, Pelorus acquired all of the issued and
outstanding common shares of Bowfort in exchange for 28,571,425 common shares of Pelorus at a deemed price of $0.07 per 
share, for aggregate consideration of $2,000,000.
Amalgamation
Pursuant to an amalgamation agreement dated May 19, 2005 (the "Amalgamation Agreement") between RedStar PrivateCo and 
Pelorus,  on  August  1,  2005,  RedStar  PrivateCo  and  Pelorus  completed  an  amalgamation  (pursuant  to  which  Pelorus  was  the 
"accounting" acquirer) whereby each twenty-five (25) common shares of Pelorus were exchanged for one (1) Common Share of 
RedStar and each twenty-five (25) common shares of RedStar PrivateCo were exchanged for 0.75 of a Common Share of RedStar 
and 0.25 of a Non-Voting Share of RedStar.
Following the completion of the Amalgamation, the Common Shares and Non-Voting Shares of RedStar began trading on the 
TSXV on August 10, 2005 and September 9, 2005, respectively.
Farm-in Agreement
On May 17, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo entered into an initial letter option agreement (the "Letter Option Agreement") with a major
oil and gas producer (the "Major") with respect to a significant farm-in and option opportunity for RedStar PrivateCo on certain of 
the Major's properties in northeast British Columbia.
This agreement was superseded by a September 2005 option and farm-in agreement (the "BC Option and Farm-In Agreement") 
between RedStar and the Major.  The agreement grants RedStar the option to farm-in on all Debolt opportunities and complete 
and earn an interest in all other shallow gas and oil prospects in RedStar's core area in northeast British Columbia, excluding the 
Jean Marie formation and Kakisa formation.  The optioned area consists of approximately 2.77 million acres.  Pursuant to the 
agreement, RedStar has committed to shooting a 3-D seismic program in the winter of 2005/2006.  The terms of the agreement 
are such that RedStar shall pay all costs to earn a 100% working interest subject to a 15% convertible gross overriding royalty
payable to the Major before payout.  After payout, RedStar shall convert to a 50% working interest.  Each drilled well shall give a 
two spacing unit earning.  RedStar has a right of first refusal to purchase production should it come available.  The option and
farm-in agreement terminates on May 31, 2008.  RedStar also has access to the Major's extensive technical data base and gas 
gathering system.
Financing
On November 15, 2005, RedStar completed a bought-deal financing whereby RedStar issued 4,925,900 Common Share Special 
Warrants  at  a price of $2.70  per  Common Share  Special Warrant  and 9,636,800  Flow-Through  Special  Warrants  at  a  price of 
$3.30 per Flow-Through Special Warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of $45,101,370 dated November 15, 2005.  See also "Plan 
of Distribution".

Trends
The  prices  for  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  have  been  volatile  over  the  last  few  years.    Management  anticipates  this  volatility  to
continue.  Dramatic downward swings in the world prices for crude oil and natural gas could affect the economic viability of the
Corporation's prospects.
Another trend is the volatility in the external capital markets that the industry is currently experiencing which impacts publicly
traded entities, such as RedStar, in the event that they seek to raise additional equity.  In management's view, this can be partly 
attributed to uncertainty regarding the future growth prospects for world economies and to uncertainty regarding the future supply 
and demand for oil and gas.
An additional trend relates to the size of entities in which investors are willing to invest.  Those with larger market capitalization
provide for greater liquidity and, as a result, appear to be more attractive; however, smaller entities may present potentially larger 
returns, as they have not yet appreciated in value in relation to current commodity prices.
Disclosure of Reserves Data
The  reserve  disclosure  presented  below  conforms  with  the  requirements  of  NI  51-101.    Additional  information  not 
required by NI 51-101 has been presented to provide continuity which management believes is important to readers of this 
information.
Principal Properties
Klua – Northeast British Columbia
The Klua property is located approximately 40 kilometres southeast of Fort Nelson, British Columbia.  The property consists of 2
spacing  units  of  land  and  one  gas  well  with  an  option  on  2  additional  spacing  units  of  land.    RedStar  completed  a  farm-in 
agreement whereby it paid the equipping and tie-in costs of the well in order to earn a before payout working interest of 100% 
with a 50% working interest after payout in the well and two spacing units.  During the payout period, production is subject to a 
15% gross overriding royalty.
The  a-56-B  well  has  been  tied  into  a  third  party  gathering  system  and  was  placed  on  production  in  July  of  2005.    Continued 
modifications to downhole equipment have realized increasing production rates with the well currently producing at 4.0 mmcf/d 
without shrinkage.  Sales volumes are currently 3.1 mmcf/d (517 boe/d).  The well is still in a before-payout position.
13
The a-56-B gas well produces from a Keg River pinnacle reef.  The well has undergone extended flow testing that demonstrated 
that the Keg River has an absolute open flow ("AOF") test rate of 8.7 mmcf/d (1450 boe/d).  The 3-D seismic over the Keg River 
pool indicates a potential second drilling location in the southern end of the pool.  RedStar has an option on 2 additional spacing 
units  that  cover  the  southern  end  of  the  pool.    RedStar  will  evaluate  drilling  a  second  well  on  these  spacing  units  based  on 
production rates and drainage effectiveness of the first well.  RedStar will be pursuing additional opportunities in the Klua area 
with a goal of expanding its presence in Klua.
Kotcho – Northeast British Columbia
The  Kotcho  property  is  located  northeast  of  Fort  Nelson,  British  Columbia.    The  property  consists  of  one  spacing  unit  that 
includes one producing gas well.  RedStar has a 50% working interest in both the well and the land.

The producing gas well is dual completed in the Upper and Lower Debolt.  The well was placed on production from both zones in 
June 2004.  The Upper Debolt is presently producing at 1.4 mmcf/d (227 boe/d) and the Lower Debolt is producing at 1.1 mmcf/d 
(190 boe/d).  Neither zone is producing water.  Kotcho presently represents net sales gas to RedStar of 186 boe/d.
RedStar will be drilling two wells to off-set the existing producer during the 2005-2006 winter drilling season.  A third Debolt
well will be drilled north of the existing producer in order to evaluate a seismic anomaly.  The Kotcho property is accessible for 
drilling only during the winter season.
RedStar will be pursuing additional opportunities in the Kotcho area with a goal of expanding its presence in the area.
Ekwan – Northeast British Columbia
The "Ekwan Farmout Lands" are located east of Fort Nelson, British Columbia. The lands consist of approximately 45 spacing 
units  totalling  approximately  13,000  hectares  (32,125  acres)  of  land.  RedStar  has  entered  into  a  farm-in  agreement  whereby 
RedStar will  earn  30% (net 15%) of  a  third-party's  working  interest  in the  Ekwan Farmout  Lands  for gas rights  in  the Debolt 
formation. The third party's interest ranges from 25% - 100% and averages approximately 50%. RedStar has the rolling option to 
drill/re-complete  option  wells  on  the  Ekwan  Farmout  Lands  to  earn  the  third-party  major's  remaining  working  interest  in  the 
lands. Upon completion of an option well, RedStar will earn 100% of the farmor's remaining working interest in the option well 
spacing unit and one other pre-selected section, subject to an overriding royalty.

RedStar shot 60 square miles of high-resolution 3-D seismic over the entire Ekwan land during the 2004/2005 winter season. The 
3-D seismic is an integral part of the completed farm-in agreement. Seismic and geological evaluation has resulted in RedStar 
identifying 7 Debolt locations that will be drilled in the upcoming 2005-2006 winter drilling season.  RedStar has completed a 
farmin that has added more available interest in 12 perspective sections.
An additional Debolt location to the southeast of the Ekwan property, known as Ekwan Lake, has also been identified and will be
drilled in the upcoming winter.  This well will be offsetting an existing Debolt producer.
Thetlaandoa – Northeast British Columbia
The "Thetlaandoa Farmout Lands" are located northeast of Fort Nelson, British Columbia.  RedStar has entered into a farm-in 
agreement whereby RedStar will pay 100% to earn 50% of a third-party's working interest in the Thetlaandoa Farmout Lands for 
all gas rights, excluding gas in the Jean Marie and Kakisa.  RedStar has the rolling option to drill option wells on the Thetlaandoa 
Farmout  Lands.    RedStar  has  identified  and  will  drill  6  Debolt  gas  wells.    In  addition,  RedStar  will  participate  in  up  to  5 
additional  Debolt  wells  as  a  33%  non-operated  partner.    The  Thetlaandoa  area  has  excellent  Debolt  potential  with  significant 
Debolt production in the area.

The producing gas well is completed in the Cadomin and Bluesky formations.  The Cadomin is no longer on production due to 
high water production and the Bluesky is temporarily suspended due to mechanical communication between the two zones.  A 
workover  is  imminently  planned  for  the  well  and  it  is  anticipated  that  the  Bluesky  will  return  to  a  pre-communication  rate  of 
approximately 1.0 mmcf/d (167 boe/d).  This represents approximately 25 boe/d net to RedStar.  The standing well was tied in 
this fall and is expected to be placed on production at approximately 1.5 mmcf/d (250 boe/d) once the operator has completed 
plant modifications to handle the additional gas from this well.  RedStar will be taking its before payout royalty gas in-kind, thus 
adding approximately 28 boe/d of gas production.
16
A  bitumen  layer  underlies  the  Bluesky  gas  in  both  of  the  wells.    Historical  reserves  and  production  analysis  in  the  area  have 
revealed that Bluesky gas reserves are larger than what engineering volumetric reserve calculations can estimate.  It is believed
that  as  the  Bluesky  reservoir  decreases  in  pressure,  solution  gas  trapped  in  the  bitumen  is  released.    On  a  practical  level,  this
means that the actual volume of gas that can be recovered from the Bluesky is greater than what engineering calculations can 
determine.
RedStar has completed geological evaluations in order to determine future drilling opportunities on the property.
Tweedie – Northeast Alberta
The Tweedie farm-in lands are located north of the town of Lac La Biche, Alberta.  A farm-out agreement provided RedStar the 
opportunity to participate in the drilling of 4 wells in the Tweedie area.  RedStar earned a 15% working interest in each of the four 
wells through a 100% for 70% farm-out agreement.  The farm-out agreement was structured whereby RedStar paid 100% of the 
farmor's share of the drilling, completion and equipping costs for the four wells in order to earn 70% of the farmor's interest in the 
wells.
The  4  wells  were  drilled  in  early  2005  and  all  were  cased  for  multi-zone  gas  production.    Two  wells  have  been  placed  on 
production and are presently producing at approximately 390 mcf/d (65 boe/d) which gives RedStar approximately 55 boe/d of 
net production.  A third well will be tied-in this winter and is expected to provide RedStar with an additional 12.5 boe/d.
Elleh & Sextet – Northeast British Columbia
The  Elleh  &  Sextet  farm-in  lands  are  located  southeast  of  Fort  Nelson,  British  Columbia.    The  farm-out  lands  consist  of  two 
groups of spacing units.  Group A consists of 2 spacing units and Group B consists of 7 spacing units.  RedStar has finalized a
farm-out agreement where-by it earns a 100% before payout working interest in the test well spacing unit in each Group (subject
to a 15% overriding royalty) that reverts to a 50% working interest after payout.  Upon earning in each of the test well spacing
units, RedStar will earn a 50% working interest in the remaining spacing unit in Group A and a 50% working interest in two 
contiguous spacing units in Group B.  RedStar has further farm-out options in the remaining 4 spacing units in Group B.
Terms  of  the  farm-out  require  RedStar  to  re-complete,  equip  and  tie-in  an  existing  well  in  each  of  the  test  well  spacing  units 
located in both Groups A and B.  Both of the existing wells will be re-completed for natural gas in the Debolt formation in late
2005.

Canadian Progress Resources Limited & Moriah Corporation
Darling Creek – Northwest Alberta
The Darling Creek property is located north of the town of Slave Lake, Alberta. The property consists of one gas well and various 
working  interests  in  1.75  sections  of  land.  CPRL  and  Moriah  will  have  a  combined  45.6%  before  payout  working  interest  in 
section 19, which, after pooling and payout, will result in an effective working interest of 22.8%. Ownership will include the 13-
19 well. CPRL and Moriah also have a 40% working interest in three-quarters of section 30, which upon pooling with the owner 
of the NE/4 section 30, will convert to 30% of the entire section. Addition ownership in Darling Creek area is in the form of a
21.6% working interest in the SE/4 of section 25.
The  13-19  well  has  been  completed  and  tested  in  the  Bluesky  formation.    Testing  analysis  indicates  the  Bluesky  to  have  an 
extended  AOF  potential  of  4.0  mmcf/d  (667  boe/d).    During  the  test,  the  Bluesky  flowed  at  approximately  1.4  mmcf/d  (235 
boe/d).
18
A bitumen layer underlies the Bluesky gas in the 13-19 well.  It is believed that as the Bluesky reservoir decreases in pressure,
solution  gas  trapped  in  the bitumen  is released.    This generally  results  in  the  actual  recoverable  volume  of  Bluesky  gas  being 
greater than engineering reserve and decline analysis estimates.
The Bluesky pool that the 13-19 well encountered has been defined by seismic.  The seismic indicates that the Bluesky pool is a
wandering channel sand.  Seismic also defined a similar Bluesky channel sand approximately 10 kilometres directly west of the 
13-19  channel.    This  Bluesky  channel  is  now  on  production.    CPRL  and  Moriah  have  undertaken  geological  and  seismic 
evaluations  and  has  identified  another  Bluesky  drilling  location  at  11-30.    A  third  party  producer  has  an  oil  gathering  system 
located  less  than  1.0  kilometre  from  the  13-19  well.    In  order  to  expedite  placing  this  well  on  production,  the  companies  are 
actively pursuing a tie-in arrangement into this gathering system.

Cutbank Ridge – Northeast B.C.
RedStar (then Pelorus) entered into an agreement on December 15, 2004 with a major Exploration and Development company to 
shoot 400 square miles of 3D seismic data at Halfmoon Creek and Windsor Creek on the Cutbank Ridge.  RedStar (then Pelorus) 
paid 28.65% of acquisition costs for approximately 93% of the proprietary data ownership. The area is characterized by multi-
zone long life gas reserves.
In addition to these 3D seismic programs, RedStar has a licensed copy of 177 square miles of recently acquired 3D seismic data 
that RedStar is currently working for exploration and development opportunities.  This data lies adjacent and to the north of the
Windsor Creek shoot.

STATEMENT OF RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION – REDSTAR PRIVATECO
(BROWNVALE, KOTCHO AND KLUA PROPERTIES)
The report on reserves data in Form 51-101F2
The reserves data set forth below is based upon a reserves report with an effective date of December 31, 2004, and relates 
specifically to the Brownvale, Alberta, Kotcho, British Columbia and Klua, British Columbia assets formerly acquired by 
RedStar  PrivateCo  (the  following  reserves  disclosure  specifically  excludes  those  assets  of  RedStar  PrivateCo  acquired 
from  each  of  CPRL,  Moriah  and  Resources  (2003)).    Readers  should  also  note  that  the  assets  which  make  up  the 
Brownvale and Kotcho reserves were not acquired by RedStar (or a predecessor in interest) until May 3, 2005, with an 
effective date of January 1, 2005 as if RedStar PrivateCo owned such properties as at December 31, 2004.
The report of management and the directors on oil and gas disclosure in Form 51-101F3 are attached as Appendices "G" and "H" 
to, and form part of, this Prospectus.
The statement of reserves data and other oil and gas information set forth below (the "Statement") is dated December 31, 2004. 
The effective date of the Statement is December 31, 2004 and the preparation date of the Statement is May 5, 2005.
Disclosure of Reserves Data
The  reserves  data  set  forth  below  (the  "Reserves  Data")  is  based  upon  an  evaluation  by  Sproule  with  an  effective  date  of 
December 31, 2004 (the "Sproule RedStar Report").  The Reserves Data summarizes the oil, liquids and natural gas reserves of 
RedStar PrivateCo and the net present values of future net revenue for these reserves using constant prices and costs and forecast 
prices  and  costs.    The  Sproule  RedStar  Report  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  standards  contained  in  the  COGE 
Handbook  and  the  reserve  definitions  contained  in  NI  51-101.    Additional  information  not  required  by  NI 51-101  has  been 
presented  to  provide  continuity  and  additional  information  which  we  believe  is  important  to  the  readers  of  this  information.  
RedStar PrivateCo engaged Sproule to provide an evaluation of proved and proved plus probable reserves.
All of the Corporation's reserves are in Canada and, specifically, in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
Disclosure provided herein in respect of BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A BOE conversion 
ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does 
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
All  evaluations  and  reviews  of  future  net  cash  flow  are  stated  prior  to  any  provision  for  interest  costs  or  general  and 
administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been 
assigned.    It  should  not  be  assumed  that  the  estimated  future  net  cash  flow  shown  below  is  representative  of  the  fair 
market value of the Corporation's properties.  There is no assurance that such price and cost assumptions will be attained 
and  variances  could  be  material.    The  recovery  and  reserve  estimates  of  crude  oil,  NGLs  and  natural  gas  reserves 
provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered.  Actual crude 
oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

The  crude  oil,  natural  gas  liquids  and  natural  gas  reserve  estimates  presented  in  the  Sproule  RedStar  Report  are  based  on  the 
definitions and guidelines contained in the COGE Handbook.  A summary of those definitions are set forth below.
Reserve Categories
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known 
accumulations, from a given date forward, based on:
• 
• 
•
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; 
the use of established technology; and 
specified economic conditions.
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates.
(a)
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that 
the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.
26
(b)
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely 
that  the  actual  remaining  quantities  recovered  will  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  of  the  estimated  proved  plus probable 
reserves.
Other criteria that must also be met for the categorization of reserves are provided in the COGE Handbook.
Each of the reserve categories (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories:
(c)
Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or, if 
facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a 
well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing.
(i)
(ii)
Developed  producing  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from  completion  intervals 
open  at  the  time  of  the  estimate.  These  reserves  may  be  currently  producing  or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have 
previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainly.
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production, or have previously 
been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown.
(d)
Undeveloped  reserves  are  those  reserves  expected  to  be  recovered  from  known  accumulations  where  a  significant 
expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. 
They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable) to which they are assigned.
In  multi-well  pools  it  may  be  appropriate  to  allocate  total  pool  reserves  between  the  developed  and  undeveloped  categories  or  to
subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed non-producing. This allocation should be
based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in 
the pool and their respective development and production status.
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to individual reserve entities (which refers to the 
lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed) and to reported reserves (which refers to the highest level sum of individual
entity estimates for which reserves are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set 
of economic conditions:
(a)
(b)
at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves; and
at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved
plus probable reserves.
A qualitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is desirable to provide 
a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of reserves estimates will be prepared using 
deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be 
no difference between estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods.
Additional clarification of certainty levels associated with reserves estimates and the effect of aggregation is provided in the COGE 
Handbook.

Forecast Prices and Costs
The forecast cost and price assumptions assume increases in wellhead selling prices and take into account inflation with respect to 
future  operating  and  capital costs.    Crude  oil and  natural  gas  benchmark  reference  pricing,  as at  December 31, 2004,  inflation and 
exchange  rates  utilized  by  Sproule  in  the  Sproule  RedStar  Report,  which  were  Sproule's  then  current  forecasts  at  the  date  of  the
Sproule RedStar Report, were as follows:

The  Corporation  anticipates  having  sufficient  internally  generated  cash  flow  and  available  banking  facilities  to  finance  the  future 
development costs noted above.

The Alberta royalty tax credit ("ARTC") is included in the cumulative cash flow amounts. ARTC is based on the program announced
November 1989 by the Alberta government with modifications effective January 1, 1995.  RedStar qualifies for the maximum ARTC. 
Estimated future abandonment and reclamation costs related to a property have been taken into account by Sproule in determining
reserves that should be attributed to a property and in determining the aggregate future net revenue therefrom, there was deducted the 
reasonable  estimated  future  well  abandonment  costs.    No  allowance  was  made,  however,  for  reclamation  of  wellsites  or  the 
abandonment and reclamation of any facilities.

Both the constant and forecast price and cost assumptions assume the continuance of current laws and regulations. 
The extent and character of all factual data supplied to Sproule were accepted by Sproule as represented.  No field inspection was

Additional Information Relating to Reserves Data
Undeveloped Reserves
Proved Undeveloped Reserves – The Corporation has significant undeveloped reserve and production potential at its Peace River 
property.  RedStar has ownership in a proven undeveloped Bluesky gas well that tested at 12.5 mmcf/d. This well has been tied in
and is awaiting completion of plant modifications prior to placing the well on production.
Probable  Undeveloped  Reserves  -  RedStar  has  significant  exploration  and  development  potential  on  its  probable  undeveloped 
reserve base acreage.  In Klua, RedStar has a sizeable probable reserve base, a percentage of which will be converted to proven
producing now that a-56-B/94-J-9 gas well is on production.  RedStar has the option to drill a second Pine Point gas well, pending 
production and pressure testing analysis on its existing a-56-B/94-J-9 gas well, which could add significant production to RedStar
and convert probable reserves to proven.  At Kotcho, anticipated steady production from the producing well could increase the 
size  of  the  recoverable  reserves  and  convert  probable  reserves  to  proven.    In  Ekwan,  Ekwan  Lake,  Thetlaandoa  and  Gunnel, 
which  have  no  booked  reserves,  RedStar  has  a  very  large  farm-in  land  position.    These  lands  hold  significant  Debolt  gas 
production  potential.    With  high  resolution  3-D  seismic  covering  RedStar's  entire  land  position,  coupled  with  proven  Debolt 
production on the lands, RedStar sees significant reserves and production upside in northeastern British Columbia RedStar has 
farmed  into  the  Elleh  and Sextet  areas of  northeast  British  Columbia.    While  there  are  no  reserves presently  booked  for  these 
properties, RedStar will be performing two re-completions for Debolt gas during the 2005/2006 drilling season.  It is hopeful the 
two workovers will add significant production and reserves to RedStar.

Acreage may vary due to conversion rounding.
Forward Contracts
RedStar's current contracts to sell crude oil or natural gas are all at prevailing market pricing.
Additional Information Concerning Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
Future  abandonment  and  reclamation  costs  have  been  estimated  based  on  actual  costs  incurred  to  date  by  RedStar  for 
abandonment and reclamation activities.  Cost to abandon and reclaim approximately 10 gross (4.25 net) wells totalling $124,000
undiscounted are included in the estimate of future net revenue from total proved plus probable reserves.
Production Estimates
The  following  table  sets  out  the  volume  of  RedStar's  production  estimated  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005  which  is

STATEMENT OF RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION – CANADIAN PROGRESS
RESOURCES LTD. ("CPRL")
The report on reserves data in Form 51-101F2
The report of management and the directors on oil and gas disclosure in Form 51-101F3 are attached as Appendices "I" and "J" 
to, and form part of, this Prospectus.
The statement of reserves data and other oil and gas information set forth below (the "Statement") is dated November 29, 2004. 
The effective date of the Statement is September 30, 2004 and the preparation date of the Statement is November 24, 2004.
Disclosure of Reserves Data
The reserves data set forth below (the "Reserves Data") is based upon an evaluation by Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. 
with an effective date of September 30, 2004 (the "Chapman CPRL Report").  The Reserves Data summarizes the oil, liquids and 
natural gas reserves of CPRL and the net present values of future net revenue for these reserves using constant prices and costs
and forecast prices and costs.  The Chapman CPRL Report has been prepared in accordance with the standards contained in the 
COGE Handbook and the reserve definitions contained in NI 51-101.  Additional information not required by NI 51-101 has been 
presented  to  provide  continuity  and  additional  information  which  we  believe  is  important  to  the  readers  of  this  information.  
CPRL engaged Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. to provide an evaluation of proved and proved plus probable reserves.
All of the CPRL reserves are in Canada and, specifically, in the province Alberta.
Disclosure provided herein in respect of BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A BOE conversion 
ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does 
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
All  evaluations  and  reviews  of  future  net  cash  flow  are  stated  prior  to  any  provision  for  interest  costs  or  general  and 
administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been 
assigned.    It  should  not  be  assumed  that  the  estimated  future  net  cash  flow  shown  below  is  representative  of  the  fair 
market value of the CPRL properties.  There is no assurance that such price and cost assumptions will be attained and 
variances could be material.  The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves provided 
herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered.  Actual crude oil, NGLs 
and natural gas reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

The  crude  oil,  natural  gas  liquids  and  natural  gas  reserve  estimates  presented  in  the  Chapman  CPRL  Report  are  based  on  the 
definitions and guidelines contained in the COGE Handbook.  A summary of those definitions are set forth below.
Reserve Categories
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known 
accumulations, from a given date forward, based on:
• 
• 
•
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; 
the use of established technology; and 
specified economic conditions.
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates.
(a)
(b)
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that 
the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely 
that  the  actual  remaining  quantities  recovered  will  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  of  the  estimated  proved  plus probable 
reserves.
Other criteria that must also be met for the categorization of reserves are provided in the COGE Handbook.
Each of the reserve categories (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories:
(c)
Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or, if 
facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a 
well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing.
(i)
Developed  producing  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from  completion  intervals 
open  at  the  time  of  the  estimate.  These  reserves  may  be  currently  producing  or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have 
previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainly.
37
(ii)
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production, or have previously 
been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown.
(d)
Undeveloped  reserves  are  those  reserves  expected  to  be  recovered  from  known  accumulations  where  a  significant 
expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. 
They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable) to which they are assigned.
In  multi-well  pools  it  may  be  appropriate  to  allocate  total  pool  reserves  between  the  developed  and  undeveloped  categories  or  to
subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed non-producing. This allocation should be
based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in 
the pool and their respective development and production status.
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to individual reserve entities (which refers to the 
lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed) and to reported reserves (which refers to the highest level sum of individual
entity estimates for which reserves are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set 
of economic conditions:
(a)
(b)
at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves; and
at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved
plus probable reserves.
A qualitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is desirable to provide 
a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of reserves estimates will be prepared using 
deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be 
no difference between estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods.
Additional clarification of certainty levels associated with reserves estimates and the effect of aggregation is provided in the COGE 
Handbook.

Forecast Prices and Costs
The forecast cost and price assumptions assume increases in wellhead selling prices and take into account inflation with respect to 
future operating and capital costs.  Crude oil and natural gas  benchmark reference pricing, as at September 30, 2004, inflation and 
exchange  rates  utilized  by  Chapman  Petroleum  Engineering  Ltd.  in  the  Chapman  CPRL  Report,  which  were  Chapman  Petroleum 
Engineering Ltd. then current forecasts at the date of the Chapman CPRL Report, were as follows:

The Alberta royalty tax credit ("ARTC") is included in the cumulative cash flow amounts. ARTC is based on the program announced
November 1989 by the Alberta government with modifications effective January 1, 1995.  RedStar qualifies for the maximum ARTC. 
Estimated  future  abandonment  and  reclamation  costs  related  to  a  property  have  been  taken  into  account  by  Chapman  Petroleum 
Engineering Ltd. in determining reserves that should be attributed to a property and in determining the aggregate future net revenue 
therefrom,  there  was  deducted  the  reasonable  estimated  future  well  abandonment  costs.    No  allowance  was  made,  however,  for 
reclamation of wellsites or the abandonment and reclamation of any facilities. 
Both the constant and forecast price and cost assumptions assume the continuance of current laws and regulations. 
The extent and character of all factual data supplied to Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. were accepted by Chapman Petroleum 
Engineering Ltd. as represented.  No field inspection was conducted.

Additional Information Relating to Reserves Data
Undeveloped Reserves
Proved  Undeveloped  Reserves  -  CPRL  has  proved  undeveloped  Bluesky  gas  reserves  at  its  Darling  Creek  property.    CPRL 
participated in the drilling, completion and testing of the Bluesky 13-19 gas well.  Testing demonstrated a steady gas rate of 1.4 
mmcf/d.  A tie-in strategy is actively being pursued for this well.
Probable Undeveloped Reserves - CPRL has additional probable reserves at Darling Creek.  Geological and seismic evaluations 
have defined a second Bluesky drilling location and it is anticipated that this location can be drilled, thus converting probable
reserves to proven reserves, leading to the establishment of additional gas production from Darling Creek.

Forward Contracts
CPRL's current contracts to sell crude oil or natural gas are all at prevailing market pricing.
Additional Information Concerning Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
Future abandonment and reclamation costs have been estimated based on actual costs incurred to date on the CPRL properties for 
abandonment and reclamation activities.  The cost to abandon and reclaim approximately 1 gross (0.16 net) wells totalling $6,000
undiscounted are included in the estimate of future net revenue from total proved plus probable reserves.
Capital Expenditures
The  following  tables  summarize  capital  expenditures  (net  of  incentives  and  net  of  certain  proceeds  and  including  capitalized

"Dry and Abandoned" means a well which is not a productive well or a service well.  A productive well is a well which is capable of 
producing oil and gas in commercial quantities or in quantities considered by the operator to be sufficient to justify the costs required 
to complete, equip and produce the well.  A service well means a well such as a water or gas-injection, water-source or water-disposal 
well.  Such wells do not have marketable reserves of crude oil or natural gas attributed to them but are essential to the production of 
the crude oil and natural gas reserves.

with an effective date of September 30, 2004 (the "Chapman Moriah Report").  The Reserves Data summarizes the oil, liquids 
and natural gas reserves of Moriah and the net present values of future net revenue for these reserves using constant prices and
costs and forecast prices and costs.  The Chapman Moriah Report has been prepared in accordance with the standards contained in
the COGE Handbook and the reserve definitions contained in NI 51-101.  Additional information not required by NI 51-101 has 
been presented to provide continuity and additional information which we believe is important to the readers of this information. 
Moriah is in a non-taxable position, therefore no after tax calculations have been performed. Moriah engaged Chapman Petroleum 
Engineering Ltd. to provide an evaluation of proved and proved plus probable reserves.
All of Moriah's reserves are in Canada and, specifically, in the province of Alberta.
Disclosure provided herein in respect of BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A BOE conversion 
ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does 
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
All  evaluations  and  reviews  of  future  net  cash  flow  are  stated  prior  to  any  provision  for  interest  costs  or  general  and 
administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been 
assigned.    It  should  not  be  assumed  that  the  estimated  future  net  cash  flow  shown  below  is  representative  of  the  fair 
market value of the Moriah properties.  There is no assurance that such price and cost assumptions will be attained and 
variances could be material.  The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves provided 
herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered.  Actual crude oil, NGLs 
and natural gas reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

The  crude  oil,  natural  gas  liquids  and  natural  gas  reserve  estimates  presented  in  the  Chapman  Moriah  Report  are  based  on  the 
definitions and guidelines contained in the COGE Handbook.  A summary of those definitions are set forth below.
Reserve Categories
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known 
accumulations, from a given date forward, based on:
• 
• 
•
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; 
the use of established technology; and 
specified economic conditions.
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates.
(a)
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that 
the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.
48
(b)
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely 
that  the  actual  remaining  quantities  recovered  will  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  of  the  estimated  proved  plus probable 
reserves.
Other criteria that must also be met for the categorization of reserves are provided in the COGE Handbook.
Each of the reserve categories (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories:
(c)
Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or, if 
facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a 
well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing.
(i)
(ii)
Developed  producing  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from  completion  intervals 
open  at  the  time  of  the  estimate.  These  reserves  may  be  currently  producing  or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have 
previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainly.
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production, or have previously 
been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown.
(d)
Undeveloped  reserves  are  those  reserves  expected  to  be  recovered  from  known  accumulations  where  a  significant 
expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. 
They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable) to which they are assigned.
In  multi-well  pools  it  may  be  appropriate  to  allocate  total  pool  reserves  between  the  developed  and  undeveloped  categories  or  to
subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed non-producing. This allocation should be
based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in 
the pool and their respective development and production status.
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to individual reserve entities (which refers to the 
lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed) and to reported reserves (which refers to the highest level sum of individual
entity estimates for which reserves are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set 
of economic conditions:
(a)
(b)
at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves; and
at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved
plus probable reserves.
A qualitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is desirable to provide 
a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of reserves estimates will be prepared using 
deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be 
no difference between estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods.
Additional clarification of certainty levels associated with reserves estimates and the effect of aggregation is provided in the COGE 
Handbook.

Forecast Prices and Costs
The forecast cost and price assumptions assume increases in wellhead selling prices and take into account inflation with respect to 
future operating and capital costs.  Crude oil and natural gas  benchmark reference pricing, as at September 30, 2004, inflation and 
exchange rates utilized by Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. in the Chapman Moriah Report, which were Chapman Petroleum 
Engineering Ltd. then current forecasts at the date of the Chapman Moriah Report, were as follows:

The Alberta royalty tax credit ("ARTC") is included in the cumulative cash flow amounts. ARTC is based on the program announced
November 1989 by the Alberta government with modifications effective January 1, 1995.  Moriah qualifies for the maximum ARTC. 
Estimated future abandonment and reclamation costs related to a property have been taken into account by Chapman Engineering Ltd.
in determining reserves that should be attributed to a property and in determining the aggregate future net revenue therefrom, there 
was deducted the reasonable estimated future well abandonment costs.  No allowance was made, however, for reclamation of wellsites 
or the abandonment and reclamation of any facilities. 
Both the constant and forecast price and cost assumptions assume the continuance of current laws and regulations. 
The extent and character of all factual data supplied to Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd. were accepted by Chapman Petroleum 
Engineering Ltd. as represented.  No field inspection was conducted.

Advisory:  The foregoing table is required under NI 51-101.  Due to the specific application of this calculation and the 
evolving  disclosure  requirements  of  NI  51-101,  the  calculation  presented  above  represents  our  interpretation  of  the 
required disclosure and computation.
Additional Information Relating to Reserves Data
Undeveloped Reserves
Proved  Undeveloped  Reserves  -  Moriah  has  proved  undeveloped  Bluesky  gas  reserves  at  its  Darling  Creek  property.    Moriah 
participated in the drilling, completion and testing of the Bluesky 13-19 gas well.  Testing demonstrated a steady gas rate of 1.4 
mmcf/d.  A tie-in strategy is actively being pursued for this well.
Probable Undeveloped Reserves - Moriah has additional probable reserves at Darling Creek.  Geological and seismic evaluations 
have defined a second Bluesky drilling location and it is anticipated that this location can be drilled, thus converting probable
reserves to proven reserves, leading to the establishment of additional gas production from Darling Creek.

Forward Contracts
Moriah's current contracts to sell crude oil or natural gas are all at prevailing market pricing.
Additional Information Concerning Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
Future abandonment and reclamation costs have been estimated based on actual costs incurred to date by Moriah for abandonment 
and reclamation activities.  The cost to abandon and reclaim approximately 1 gross (0.29 net) wells totalling $6,000 undiscounted 
are included in the estimate of future net revenue from total proved plus probable reserves.
Capital Expenditures
The  following  tables  summarize  capital  expenditures  (net  of  incentives  and  net  of  certain  proceeds  and  including  capitalized

Note:

"Dry and Abandoned" means a well which is not a productive well or a service well.  A productive well is a well which is capable of 
producing oil and gas in commercial quantities or in quantities considered by the operator to be sufficient to justify the costs required 
to complete, equip and produce the well.  A service well means a well such as a water or gas-injection, water-source or water-disposal 
well.  Such wells do not have marketable reserves of crude oil or natural gas attributed to them but are essential to the production of 
the crude oil and natural gas reserves.

STATEMENT OF RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION –
AVENIR RESOURCES (2003) LTD. ("RESOURCES (2003)")
The report on reserves data in Form 51-101F2
The report of management and the directors on oil and gas disclosure in Form 51-101F3 are attached as Appendices "M" and "N" 
to, and form part of, this Prospectus.
The statement of reserves data and other oil and gas information set forth below (the "Statement") is dated March 31, 2005.  The
effective date of the Statement is March 31, 2005 and the preparation date of the Statement is April to May, 2005.
Disclosure of Reserves Data
The reserves data set forth below (the "Reserves Data") is based upon an evaluation by Sproule with an effective date of March 
31, 2005 (the "Sproule Resources (2003) Report").  The Reserves Data summarizes the oil, liquids and natural gas reserves of 
Resources (2003) and the net present values of future net revenue for these reserves using constant prices and costs and forecast 
prices  and  costs.    The  Sproule  Resources  (2003)  Report  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  standards  contained  in  the 
COGE Handbook and the reserve definitions contained in NI 51-101.  Additional information not required by NI 51-101 has been 
presented  to  provide  continuity  and  additional  information  which  we  believe  is  important  to  the  readers  of  this  information.  
Resources (2003) engaged Sproule to provide an evaluation of proved and proved plus probable reserves.
All of Resources (2003)'s reserves are in Canada and, specifically, in the province of Alberta.
Disclosure provided herein in respect of BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A BOE conversion 
ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does 
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
All  evaluations  and  reviews  of  future  net  cash  flow  are  stated  prior  to  any  provision  for  interest  costs  or  general  and 
administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been 
assigned.    It  should  not  be  assumed  that  the  estimated  future  net  cash  flow  shown  below  is  representative  of  the  fair 
market  value  of  Resources  (2003)'s  properties.    There  is  no  assurance  that  such  price  and  cost  assumptions  will  be 
attained and variances could be material.  The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves 
provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered.  Actual crude 
oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

Notes to Reserves Data Tables:
(5) 
(6)
Columns may not add due to rounding. 
The crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserve estimates presented in the Sproule Resources (2003) Report are based on the 
definitions and guidelines contained in the COGE Handbook.  A summary of those definitions are set forth below.
Reserve Categories
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known 
accumulations, from a given date forward, based on:
• 
• 
•
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; 
the use of established technology; and 
specified economic conditions.
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates.
(a)
(b)
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that 
the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely 
that  the  actual  remaining  quantities  recovered  will  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  of  the  estimated  proved  plus probable 
reserves.
Other criteria that must also be met for the categorization of reserves are provided in the COGE Handbook.
Each of the reserve categories (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories:
(c)
Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or, if 
facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a 
well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing.
59
(i)
(ii)
Developed  producing  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from  completion  intervals 
open  at  the  time  of  the  estimate.  These  reserves  may  be  currently  producing  or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have 
previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainly.
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production, or have previously 
been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown.
(d)
Undeveloped  reserves  are  those  reserves  expected  to  be  recovered  from  known  accumulations  where  a  significant 
expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. 
They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable) to which they are assigned.
In  multi-well  pools  it  may  be  appropriate  to  allocate  total  pool  reserves  between  the  developed  and  undeveloped  categories  or  to
subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed non-producing. This allocation should be
based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in 
the pool and their respective development and production status.
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to individual reserve entities (which refers to the 
lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed) and to reported reserves (which refers to the highest level sum of individual
entity estimates for which reserves are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set 
of economic conditions:
(a)
(b)
at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves; and
at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved
plus probable reserves.
A qualitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is desirable to provide 
a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of reserves estimates will be prepared using 
deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be 
no difference between estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods.
Additional clarification of certainty levels associated with reserves estimates and the effect of aggregation is provided in the COGE 
Handbook.

Forecast Prices and Costs
The forecast cost and price assumptions assume increases in wellhead selling prices and take into account inflation with respect to 
future  operating  and  capital costs.    Crude  oil and  natural  gas  benchmark  reference  pricing,  as at  December 31, 2004,  inflation and 
exchange rates utilized by Sproule in the Sproule Resources (2003) Report, which were Sproule's then current forecasts at the date of 
the Sproule Resources (2003) Report, were as follows:

Resources  (2003)  anticipates  having  sufficient  internally  generated  cash  flow  and  available  banking  facilities  to  finance  the  future 
development costs noted above.

The Alberta royalty tax credit ("ARTC") is included in the cumulative cash flow amounts. ARTC is based on the program announced
November  1989  by  the  Alberta  government  with  modifications  effective  January  1,  1995.    Resources  (2003)  qualifies  for  the 
maximum ARTC. 
Estimated future abandonment and reclamation costs related to a property have been taken into account by Sproule in determining
reserves that should be attributed to a property and in determining the aggregate future net revenue therefrom, there was deducted the 
reasonable  estimated  future  well  abandonment  costs.    No  allowance  was  made,  however,  for  reclamation  of  wellsites  or  the 
abandonment and reclamation of any facilities. 
Both the constant and forecast price and cost assumptions assume the continuance of current laws and regulations. 
The extent and character of all factual data supplied to Sproule were accepted by Sproule as represented.  No field inspection was 
conducted.

associated with its undeveloped lands.
Forward Contracts
Resources (2003)'s current contracts to sell crude oil or natural gas are all at prevailing market pricing.
Additional Information Concerning Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
Future abandonment and reclamation costs have been estimated based on actual costs incurred to date by Resources  (2003) for 
abandonment  and  reclamation  activities.    The  cost  to  abandon  and  reclaim  approximately  1  gross  (0.45  net)  wells  totalling 
$47,000 undiscounted are included in the estimate of future net revenue from total proved plus probable reserves.
Capital Expenditures
The  following  tables  summarize  capital  expenditures  (net  of  incentives  and  net  of  certain  proceeds  and  including  capitalized

"Dry and Abandoned" means a well which is not a productive well or a service well.  A productive well is a well which is capable of 
producing oil and gas in commercial quantities or in quantities considered by the operator to be sufficient to justify the costs required 
to complete, equip and produce the well.  A service well means a well such as a water or gas-injection, water-source or water-disposal 
well.  Such wells do not have marketable reserves of crude oil or natural gas attributed to them but are essential to the production of 
the crude oil and natural gas reserves.

STATEMENT OF RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION – PELORUS ENERGY CORP.
("PELORUS")
This Prospectus, as well as the BAR for the above acquisitions should have included an audited operating statement for the assets
acquired, but the operating statement has not been included in either the Prospectus or the BAR for the following reasons:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
the  current  board  of  directors  and  management  of  the  Corporation,  when  agreeing  to  become  involved  with  the 
Corporation, were advised that the Corporation was up to date in all its requisite filings under applicable securities laws 
and were not aware that the Corporation was delinquent in the filing of a BAR for the November 2004 acquisitions;
the original acquisition agreements for the November 2004 acquisitions do not include either audit or review rights from 
the original vendors or royalty holders, and all the requisite information required to complete the revenue statements for 
a BAR report are not derivable from the Corporation's existing records.  The statements required for a BAR would be 
difficult to create as the pricing used in calculating the royalty income would not be possible to determine without the 
full cooperation of the vendors and/or the owners of the working interests in the properties;
the assets acquired would not have reflected any operating expenses to the Corporation, as the assets were strictly royalty 
income producing assets;
the  value  of  the  assets  acquired  through  the  November,  2004  acquisition  would  be  less  than  2%  of  the  Corporation's 
current  net  asset  value,  such  that  operating  statements  created  at  present  would  be  of  little  meaning  to  existing 
securityholders of the Corporation;
the information circular did not contain a statement of operations for the acquired properties, but did include a pro forma 
balance sheet to give effect to the completion of the acquisitions as well as a report on reserves data executed by the 
Corporation's then independent engineers;
in accordance with item 3.3 of the companion policy to OSC 41-501, the August 23, 2004 information circular of the 
Corporation  did  include  independent  engineering  disclosure  in  accordance  with  NI  51-101  in  respect  of  the  acquired 
properties, prepared by Chapman Petroleum Engineering Ltd., which included a summary of the reserve estimates and 
estimates of future net revenue and production volumes and other relevant information regarding the acquired properties; 
production volumes, prices received and royalties paid for the prior year; as well as estimated production volumes.  The 
circular also included disclosure to the effect that the principal properties were comprised principally of an overriding 
royalty interest, and that there were no exploratory or development wells or activities during the year ended December 
31, 2003 on any of the assets acquired; and
also  in  accordance  with  item  3.3  of  the  companion  policy  to  OSC  41-501,  the  Corporation  has  included  in  this 
Prospectus information with respect to the reserve estimates and estimates of future net revenues and production volumes 
from the acquired properties, actual production values from each of the properties, and estimated production volumes on 
a going forward basis.  See "Principal Properties – Gilby 7-7-41-1 W5, Hays 1-21-13-14 W4 and Verger Gas Unit No. 
1&16-7-21-13 W4 Well", see "Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information – Pelorus Energy Corp." 
and "Promoters".
The  report  on  reserves  data  in  Form 51-101F2  and  the  report  of  management  and  the  directors  on  oil  and  gas  disclosure  in 
Form 51-101F3 are attached as Appendices "O" and "P" to, and form part of, this Prospectus.
The statement of reserves data and other oil and gas information set forth below (the "Statement") is dated May 31, 2005.  The 
effective date of the Statement is May 31, 2005 and the preparation date of the Statement is September 26, 2005.
Disclosure of Reserves Data
The reserves data set forth below (the "Reserves Data") is based upon an evaluation by Sproule with an effective date of May 31,
2005 (the "Sproule Pelorus Report") contained in the Sproule Pelorus Report.  The Reserves Data summarizes the oil, liquids and
natural gas reserves of Pelorus and the net present values of future net revenue for these reserves using constant prices and costs 
and forecast prices and costs.  The Sproule Pelorus Report has been prepared in accordance with the standards contained in the 
COGE Handbook and the reserve definitions contained in NI 51-101.  Additional information not required by NI 51-101 has been
67
presented  to  provide  continuity  and  additional  information  which  we  believe  is  important  to  the  readers  of  this  information.  
Pelorus engaged Sproule Associates Limited to provide an evaluation of proved and proved plus probable reserves.
All of Pelorus' reserves are in Canada and, specifically, in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
Disclosure provided herein in respect of BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.  A BOE conversion 
ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does 
not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
All  evaluations  and  reviews  of  future  net  cash  flow  are  stated  prior  to  any  provision  for  interest  costs  or  general  and 
administrative costs and after the deduction of estimated future capital expenditures for wells to which reserves have been 
assigned.    It  should  not  be  assumed  that  the  estimated  future  net  cash  flow  shown  below  is  representative  of  the  fair 
market  value  of  Pelorus'  properties.    There  is  no  assurance  that  such  price  and  cost  assumptions  will  be  attained  and 
variances could be material.  The recovery and reserve estimates of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves provided 
herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered.  Actual crude oil, NGLs 
and natural gas reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

The crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserve estimates presented in the Sproule Report are based on the definitions and 
guidelines contained in the COGE Handbook.  A summary of those definitions are set forth below.
Reserve Categories
70
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known 
accumulations, from a given date forward, based on:
• 
• 
•
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; 
the use of established technology; and 
specified economic conditions.
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates.
(a)
(b)
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that 
the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely 
that  the  actual  remaining  quantities  recovered  will  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  of  the  estimated  proved  plus probable 
reserves.
Other criteria that must also be met for the categorization of reserves are provided in the COGE Handbook.
Each of the reserve categories (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories:
(c)
Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or, if 
facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a 
well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing.
(i)
(ii)
Developed  producing  reserves  are  those  reserves  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from  completion  intervals 
open  at  the  time  of  the  estimate.  These  reserves  may  be  currently  producing  or,  if  shut-in,  they  must  have 
previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainly.
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production, or have previously 
been on production, but are shut-in, and the date of resumption of production is unknown.
(d)
Undeveloped  reserves  are  those  reserves  expected  to  be  recovered  from  known  accumulations  where  a  significant 
expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. 
They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable) to which they are assigned.
In  multi-well  pools  it  may  be  appropriate  to  allocate  total  pool  reserves  between  the  developed  and  undeveloped  categories  or  to
subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed non-producing. This allocation should be
based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific wells, facilities and completion intervals in 
the pool and their respective development and production status.
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to individual reserve entities (which refers to the 
lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed) and to reported reserves (which refers to the highest level sum of individual
entity estimates for which reserves are presented). Reported reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set 
of economic conditions:
(a)
(b)
at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved reserves; and
at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved
plus probable reserves.
A qualitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is desirable to provide 
a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of reserves estimates will be prepared using 
deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be 
no difference between estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods.
Additional clarification of certainty levels associated with reserves estimates and the effect of aggregation is provided in the COGE 
Handbook.

Forecast Prices and Costs 
The forecast cost and price assumptions assume increases in wellhead selling prices and take into account inflation with respect to 
future operating and capital costs.  Crude oil and natural gas benchmark reference pricing, as at December 31, 2004, inflation and 
exchange  rates  utilized  by  Sproule  in  the  Sproule  Pelorus  Report,  which  were  Sproule's  then  current  forecasts  at  the  date  of  the
Sproule Pelorus Report, were as follows:

Pelorus anticipates having sufficient internally generated cash flow and available banking facilities to finance the future development 
costs noted above.

(11)
The Alberta royalty tax credit ("ARTC") is included in the cumulative cash flow amounts. ARTC is based on the program announced
November 1989 by the Alberta government with modifications effective January 1, 1995.  Pelorus qualifies for the maximum ARTC. 
Estimated future abandonment and reclamation costs related to a property have been taken into account by Sproule in determining
reserves that should be attributed to a property and in determining the aggregate future net revenue therefrom, there was deducted the 
reasonable  estimated  future  well  abandonment  costs.    No  allowance  was  made,  however,  for  reclamation  of  wellsites  or  the 
abandonment and reclamation of any facilities. 
Both the constant and forecast price and cost assumptions assume the continuance of current laws and regulations. 
The extent and character of all factual data supplied to Sproule were accepted by Sproule as represented.  No field inspection was 
conducted.

Additional Information Relating to Reserves Data
Undeveloped Reserves
Proved Undeveloped Reserves – RedStar has no proved undeveloped reserves booked in these properties.  All proved reserves are 
classified as proved producing.
Probable Undeveloped Reserves - RedStar has probable reserves booked for all four properties that it has a royalty interest in.  At 
Gilby,  Sproule  has  assigned  1.2  mbbl  of  probable  oil  and  at  Hays  an  additional  1.8  mbbls  of  probable  oil  reserve  have  been 
assigned.  An additional 38 mmcf of probable gas reserves are assigned to the Verger Gas Unit No. 1 and 2 mmcf of probable 
reserves have been assigned to the Verger 16-7-21-13 W4 gas well.
Other Oil and Gas Information
Oil And Gas Wells

"Gross"  wells means the number of wells in which Pelorus has an interest. 
"Net" wells means the aggregate number of wells obtained by multiplying each gross well by Pelorus' percentage working interest
therein.
Pelorus has no gross or net wells due to all production being generated via overriding royalty interests.

Pelorus has no gross or net acres due to all production being generated via overriding royalty interests.
Forward Contracts
Pelorus' current contracts to sell crude oil or natural gas are all at prevailing market pricing.
Additional Information Concerning Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
Pelorus has no future abandonment costs since it only has royalty interests in its four properties.
Tax Horizon
Pelorus is in a non-taxable position and therefore, no future payable taxes exist.
Capital Expenditures
The  following  tables  summarize  capital  expenditures  (net  of  incentives  and  net  of  certain  proceeds  and  including  capitalized

RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. – September 30, 2005
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  for  RedStar,  formerly  Pelorus,  and  prior  thereto  Pelorus  Navigation  Systems  Inc. 
("Pelorus")  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  RedStar's  consolidated  financial  and  operating  information  and  May  31,  2005 
audited and September 30, 2005 unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in 
this document.
This interim management discussion and analysis ("MD&A") for the four months ended September 30, 2005 was prepared on 
November 24, 2005 and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the four months ended September 30, 
2005 and the year ended May 31, 2005.  The MD&A discusses the results of RedStar as it existed for the four month period ended 
September  30,  2005  and  speaks  to  the  corporate  changes  to  RedStar  subsequent  to  the  quarter  end  as  discussed  below.  
Comparative quarterly information is provided, however, the reader should note that RedStar business changed from inactive to 
oil and gas acquisition, exploration and production in September of 2004.
This MD&A refers to funds from operations, which is not a recognized measure under Canadian generally accepted accounting 
principles  ("GAAP").  Management  believes  that  in  addition  to  net  income,  funds  from  operations  is  a  useful  supplemental 
measure as it demonstrates RedStar's ability to generate the cash necessary to repay debt or fund future growth through capital
investment. The reconciliation between net income and funds flow from operations can be found on the statements of cash flow in
the  interim  financial  statements  and  the  audited  financial  statements.  Investors  are  cautioned  that  this  measure  should  not  be 
construed  as  an  alternative  to  net  income  determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP  as  an  indication  of  RedStar's  performance. 
RedStar's method of calculating these measures may differ from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be 
comparable to measures used by other companies.
For the purposes of calculating unit costs, natural gas has been converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) using 6,000 cubic feet 
of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil (6:1), unless otherwise stated. The Boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 Bbl is based on an 
energy equivalency conversion method and does not represent a value equivalency; therefore Boe's may be misleading if used in 
isolation. (This conversion conforms to NI 51-101).
Highlights
Until  February  of  2003,  Pelorus  was  a  global  provider  of  products  and  services  related  to  aircraft  landings.    Following  a 
suspension of business activities and a transfer from the TSXV to the NEX board of the TSXV, RedStar has undergone several 
changes.  Pelorus was re-activated and re-listed on the TSXV, changed its name to Pelorus Energy Corp. and changed operations 
into an oil and gas company by way of initiatives that were approved by shareholders in September 2004.
77
On October 29, 2004, Pelorus completed a private placement of 18,750,000 flow-through common shares at a price of $0.08 per 
share for gross proceeds of $1,500,000.  The expenditure commitment of $1,500,000 was renounced to investors on December 31, 
2004 in accordance with the terms of the flow-through share agreements.
In  November  2004,  through  two  separate  transactions  with  arms-length  parties,  Pelorus  purchased  petroleum  and  natural  gas 
assets  for  total  consideration  of  $1,121,900,  before  final  adjustments.    These  transactions  have  been  accounted  for  using  the 
purchase method of accounting.  The first transaction was paid for by the issuance of 674,000 common shares of Pelorus valued at
$1,011,900.  The second transaction was paid by cash in the amount of $110,000, less purchase price adjustments of $4,513 (net 
$105,487), which was funded by an equity offering completed on October 29, 2004.
On December 16, 2004, Pelorus completed a second private placement consisting of 166,666,667 flow-through common shares at 
a price of $0.09 per share for gross proceeds of $15,000,000.  The expenditure commitment of $15,000,000 was renounced to 
investors on December 31, 2004 in accordance with the terms of the flow-through share agreement. As a use of proceeds for this 
offering,  Pelorus  participated  in  a  $50  million  3-D  seismic  program  on  the  Cutbank  Ridge  in  Northeastern  British  Columbia. 
Pelorus paid 30% of the seismic costs ($15 million net to Pelorus) to retain approximately 93% of the proprietary ownership of 
the data.
On  May  15,  2005,  the  shareholders  of  Pelorus  and  a  private  company  named  RedStar  Oil  &  Gas  Inc.  ("RedStar  PrivateCo") 
entered into an amalgamation agreement whereby each RedStar PrivateCo Shareholder received, in exchange for each twenty-five 
common shares of (pre-amalgamation) RedStar held, 0.75 of a Common Share of the newly amalgamated company ("RedStar") 
and 0.25 of a Non-Voting Share of RedStar; each Pelorus shareholder received, in exchange for each twenty-five common shares 
of  Pelorus  held,  one  Common  Share  of  RedStar;  and  each  outstanding  convertible  debenture  of  Pelorus  was  exchanged  for  a 
comparable  convertible  debenture  of  RedStar,  having  regard  for  the  25  to  1  exchange  ratio  set  forth  in  the  amalgamation 
agreement.
On June 30, 2005, Pelorus acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Bowfort Oil & Gas Ltd. ("Bowfort") a 
private company. Bowfort was largely inactive with its only asset being cash of $2,000,000. Total consideration given for this 
acquisition  was  1,142,857  common  shares  of  Pelorus.  The  acquisition  was  a  non-arms  length  acquisition  as  Bowfort  was 
controlled by a Director of Pelorus.
On August 1, 2005, Pelorus and RedStar PrivateCo were amalgamated and continued business under the name of "RedStar Oil & 
Gas Inc.".  In conjunction with the Amalgamation, RedStar changed its fiscal year-end to December 31. Below is a table detailing
RedStar's new financial statement presentation schedule.

On September 22, 2005, RedStar announced that it had entered into  an option and farm-in agreement with a major independent 
gas  producer  (the  "Major")  to  have  the  option  to  farm-in  on  all  shallow  gas  and  oil  prospects  in  RedStar's  core  area  of 
northeastern British Columbia. The optioned area includes over 2.77 million acres and provides RedStar with priority access to 
the Major's extensive gas gathering, production and processing infrastructure as well as access to the Major's extensive technical
database. As part of its winter capital program, RedStar has committed to shoot several additional 3-D seismic programs in the 
area at an estimated cost of $33 million.
78
On November 15, 2005 RedStar closed a "bought-deal" financing agreement with a syndicate of underwriters to issue 4,481,400 
common share Special Warrants at a price of $2.70 per Common Share Special Warrant and 8,787,800 Flow-Through Special 
Warrants at a price of $3.30 per Flow-Through Warrant for gross proceeds of $41,099,520. Each Special Warrant will entitle the 
holder  to  acquire  one  Common  Share  at  no  additional  cost.  RedStar  has  also  granted  the  Underwriters  an  option  to  purchase, 
which was exercised on or before closing of the offering, up to an additional 444,500 Common Share Special Warrants at a price 
of $2.70 per Common Share Special Warrant and up to an additional 849,000 Flow-Through Special Warrants at a price of $3.30 
per Flow-Through Special Warrant for further gross proceeds of $4,001,850, which increased the total offering to $45,101,370.

As RedStar only recommenced active business in September 2004, summary financial information for quarters ending prior to 
November 30, 2004 is not presented.
The net income generated in the three months ended February 28, 2005 was primarily  due to the recognition of a recovery of 
future income taxes of $4,770,079 as the ability of RedStar to utilize its tax pools to shelter future income became more likely
than not.
Operational review
For the four month period ended September 30, 2005, the majority of RedStar's operational activity came as a result of the August 
1, 2005 amalgamation with RedStar PrivateCo discussed above and as such, unless otherwise noted, the following operational 
review relates to the four month period ended September 30, 2005 and the three month period ended August 31, 2004.
Revenue
For the four months ended September 30, 2005, oil and gas revenues were $1,414,900.  Substantially all of RedStar's production 
during this period was from natural gas. Production volumes for the four month period was 32,789 Boe. At September 30, 2005 
RedStar's production volumes were approximately 600 boe/d which was in line with expectations.
For the four months ended September 30, 2005, natural gas prices averaged $9.84/mcf.  RedStar markets its natural gas on the 
spot market to a major marketer with all production inventory balances cleared at the end of each month. RedStar did not have 
any production hedges in place at any time during the four months ended September 30, 2005.
79
RedStar  has  been  relatively  inactive  since  approximately  February  28,  2003  and,  accordingly,  reported  no  revenue  from 
operations for the three months ended August 31, 2004.
Royalties
RedStar's total royalty encumbrance for the four months ended September 30, 2005 was $519,862, consisting of both Crown and 
overriding  royalties.  Prior  to  the  amalgamation  with  RedStar  PrivateCo,  primarily  all  of  RedStar's  revenue  was  attributable  to 
gross  overriding  royalty  income  which  is  not  itself  further  encumbered  by  other  royalties.  RedStar's  royalty  rate  for  the  four 
months ended September 30, 2005 was approximately 27%. RedStar expects this royalty rate to increase to approximately 34% as 
additional wells are drilled on farm-in lands which will be encumbered with an additional 15% gross overriding royalty payable to
the Farmor until payout is reached. Only 3% of RedStar's current production is subject to the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit and as
such the impact of this credit is small.
Operating Expenses
The overall operating costs for the four months ended September 30, 2005 was $505,940 made up primarily of contract operator 
fees and natural gas processing and transportation charges. On a per Boe basis, operating costs were $15.43 per Boe which is 
higher than the $9.00 per Boe forecast. The higher operating costs were primarily related to higher than expected startup costs at 
RedStar's Klua a-56-B well. Going forward, RedStar expects operating costs on a unit of production basis to be closer to forecast 
as production volumes increase and more economies of scale are realized.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses totalled $221,919 for the four months ended September 30, 2005. These expenses consisted 
primarily  of  accounting  fees,  consulting  fees,  printing  costs  and  office  setup  expenses.  RedStar  does  not  capitalize  any  direct
general and administrative charges.
Due to RedStar being inactive in the three months ended August 31, 2004, administrative expenses have been minimal and are 
composed primarily of costs associated with the reactivation transaction of RedStar and conversion into the oil and gas business.
These include: legal fees of $12,372, exchange, commission and transfer fees of $9,050, engineering consulting fees of $2,478 
and  administrative  expenses  primarily  related  to  the  office  facilities  of  RedStar  in  Calgary  of  $23,897.  An  accrual  of  interest
payable on the debentures of $30,297 was recorded for the three months ended August 31, 2004.
Depletion, Depreciation and Accretion
Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expenses totalled $1,063,096, or $32.42 per Boe, for the four months ended 
September 30, 2005. The higher average depletion charges relate to the increased book value of RedStar's capital assets resulting
from  the  amalgamation  with  RedStar  PrivateCo  and  the  associated  bump  in  capital  assets  as  they  relate  to  the  purchase  price 
equation for the four month period ended September 30, 2005.  $29.0 million of capital assets related to non-producing assets 
were excluded from RedStar's DD&A calculation. As these assets become developed and productive, the associated capital costs 
will be added into the depletable asset base.
For the three months ended August 31, 2004, $6,875 amortization has been recorded on RedStar's remaining assets.
Income Taxes
RedStar has recorded a current income tax expense of $313,600 for the four months ended September 30, 2005 which will be 
offset by the utilization of investment tax credits currently recorded on RedStar's balance sheet.  RedStar also recorded a future 
income tax asset of $427,200 for the four month period ended September 30, 2005. These future taxes result primarily from the 
tax effect of the flow-through shares that were issued in December 2004.
Funds from Operations
Funds from operations for the four months ended September 30, 2005 were $684,021 ($0.04 per share).  RedStar believes that the 
levels achieved in the four month period is sustainable given its forecast commodity prices, operating costs and royalty rates are 
all in line with values being currently realized.
80
Operations for the three months ended August 31, 2004 resulted in a negative cash flow of $79,592 ($0.11 per share) is due to the 
costs incurred in the reactivation transaction of RedStar and conversion into an oil and gas company.
Net Income
The net loss for the four months ended September 30, 2005 was $355,475 ($0.02 per share). The primary reason for the net loss 
was the higher than average DD&A charge ($1,063,096) discussed above.  The loss of $86,467 in the three month period ended 
August 31, 2004 is due to RedStar being inactive as previously discussed.
Capital Expenditures
Net  capital  expenditures,  for  cash,  for  the  four  months  ended  September  30,  2005  totalled  $1.3  million.    As  a  result  of  the 
amalgamation with RedStar PrivateCo, $22.0 million worth of producing and non-producing properties were acquired. For further 
information on this transaction refer to note 3 of the interim financial statements as at and for the four months ended September
30, 2005.
Financial Resources and Liquidity
At  September  30,  2005,  RedStar  had  a  strong  balance  sheet  with  cash  reserves  of  $4,029,955  partially  offset  by  a  non-cash 
working capital deficit of $1,282,856. RedStar currently has no long-term debt and expects to fund the balance of the currently
defined 2005 exploration and development programs through working capital, operating cash flow and the November 15, 2005 
financing  which  resulted  in  the  issuance  of  4,925,900  Common  Share  Special  Warrants  and  the  issuance  of  9,636,800  Flow-
Through  Special  Warrants  for  gross  proceeds  of  $45,101,370.    Following  issuance  of  a  final  receipt  for  this  Prospectus, 
14,562,700 Common Shares of RedStar will be issued for no additional consideration upon conversion of the outstanding Special 
Warrants.
Share Capital
At  September  30,  2005,  RedStar  had  outstanding  18,476,460  Common  Shares,  2,731,404  Non-Voting  Shares  and  3,240,000 
common  share  purchase  warrants.  Each  purchase  warrant  entitles  the  holder  to  purchase  one  common  share  for  $2.50  until 
December  31,  2009.  During  the  four  months  ended  September  30,  2005,  RedStar  issued  for  cash  15,000  Common  Shares  for 
gross  proceeds  of  $37,500.    During  the  same  period  RedStar  also  issued  1,142,857  Common  Shares  as  consideration  for  the 
acquisition of Bowfort  as described  above.  During  the four  months  ended  September 30, 2005,  RedStar  also  issued 8,194,122 
Common  Shares,  2,731,404  Non-Voting  Shares  and  3,240,000  common  share  purchase  warrants  as  consideration  in  the 
amalgamation  with  RedStar  PrivateCo  (please  refer  to  Note  3  of  the  interim  financial  statements  for  the  four  months  ended 
September 30, 2005).
Pursuant to the acquisition of RedStar PrivateCo, RedStar issued 3,240,000 warrants, each of which entitle the holder to purchase 
one Common Share at a price of $2.50 until December 31, 2009.
RedStar has a stock option plan under which employees, directors and consultants are eligible to receive grants. Options granted
under the plan have varying vesting periods and are determined by the Board at the grant date.
The following table summarizes the status of RedStar's stock option plan and the activity during the periods as follows:

Commitments and Contingencies
Pursuant  to  flow-through  financings  completed  in  the  year,  RedStar  is  committed  to  spending  $16.5  million  on  qualified 
exploration  and  development  expenditures  by  December  31,  2005.  As  at  September  30,  2005,  RedStar  has  expended 
approximately $15.2 million on qualified expenditures related to the financings.
Related Party Transactions
Effective  October  29,  2004,  the  Corporation  settled  its  previously  outstanding  debentures  (the  "Old  Debentures")  held  by 
companies with common officers and directors.  The debt was settled with an assignment of a $US600,000 aircraft services credit
and the issuance, to the same related parties, of new convertible debentures (the "New Debentures") in the amount of $500,000. 
For  the  year  ended  May  31,  2005,  the  Corporation  incurred  total  interest  expense  of  $14,521  (2004  -  $79,123)  on  the  Old 
Debentures and the New Debentures.  At May 31, 2005, a total amount of $500,000 was owed pursuant to the New Debentures 
and was repaid in the period.  See also "Promoters".
Included in accounts payable at September 30, 2005 is $361,526 due to a company with common directors with respect to capital 
expenditures.
Risks and Uncertainties
The business of developing and producing oil and natural gas reserves is inherently risky.  There is risk that the sale of RedStar's
reserves may be delayed indefinitely due to process constraints, lack of pipeline capacity or lack of markets.  The price RedStar
receives for its oil and gas reserves fluctuates continuously and for the most part is beyond its control.  RedStar is also subject to 
the risks associated with owning oil and gas properties, including environmental risks such as the pollution of air, land and water.
In all areas of RedStar business, it competes against entities that have greater technical and financial resources.  RedStar's growth 
is dependent upon external sources of financing which may not be available on acceptable terms.
RedStar  mitigates  these  risks  by  contracting  professional  services  when  required.    RedStar  diversifies  its  oil  and  gas  market 
portfolio among various marketers and aggregators and among a variety of contracts with respect to pricing and term.  Finally, all
levels of RedStar's operations are adequately insured.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The MD&A is based on RedStar's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The 
application  of GAAP requires  management  to  make  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions that  affect  the  reported  amounts of 
assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities,  if  any,  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements,  and  the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  RedStar bases its estimates on historical experience and
various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.    Actual  results  could  differ  from  these 
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The following is a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that are
inherent in the preparation of RedStar's financial statements and notes thereto.
Reserve Estimates
Estimates  of  RedStar's  reserves  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  guidelines  established  by  the  Alberta  Securities  Commission.  
Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of petroleum and natural gas that cannot be
measured  in  an  exact  manner.    The  process  relies  on  interpretations  of  available  geological,  geophysical,  engineering  and 
production data.  The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of 
that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
RedStar's reserve information is based on estimates prepared by its independent petroleum consultants.  Estimates prepared by 
others may be different than these estimates.  Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may differ from
actual results, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of petroleum and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.  
In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify revisions to the estimate.  The 
present value of future net revenues should not be assumed to be the current market value of RedStar's estimated reserves.  Actual 
future  prices,  costs  and  reserves  may  be  materially  higher  or  lower  than  the  prices,  costs  and  reserves  used  for  the  future  net
revenue calculations.
82
The estimates of reserves impact depletion and site restoration expenses.  If reserve estimates decline, the rate at which RedStar
records depletion and site restoration expenses increases, reducing net earnings.  In addition, changes in reserve estimates may
impact the outcome of RedStar's assessment of its petroleum and natural gas properties for impairment.
Kyoto
The Kyoto protocol, ratified by the Canadian Federal Government in December 2002, came into force on February 16, 2005. The 
protocol commits Canada to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to six percent below 1990 levels over the period 2008-2012. The 
Federal  Government  released  a  framework  outlining  its  Climate  Change  action  plan  on  April  13,  2005.  The  plan  as  released 
contains few technical details regarding the implementation of the Government's greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The Climate 
Change  Working  Group  of  Canadian  Association  of  Petroleum  Producers  continues  to  work  with  the  Federal  and  Alberta 
governments to develop an approach for implementing targets and enabling greenhouse gas control legislation, which protects the
industry's  competitiveness,  limits  the  cost  and  administrative  burden  of  compliance  and  supports  continued  investment  in  the 
sector. As the federal government has yet to release a detailed Kyoto compliance plan, RedStar is unable to predict the impact of 
potential regulations upon its business; however, it is possible that RedStar would face increases in operating costs in order to 
comply with the greenhouse gas emissions legislation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Impact of the Company
Comprehensive Income, Financial Instruments and Hedges
The CICA issued new standards in early 2005 for Comprehensive Income (CICA 1530), Financial Instruments (CICA 3855) and 
Hedges (CICA 3865), which will be effective for the reporting year-end 2007. The new standards will bring Canadian rules in 
line with current rules in the US. The standards will introduce the concept of "Comprehensive Income" to Canadian GAAP and 
will require that an enterprise (a) classify items of comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and (b) display 
the accumulated balance of comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity 
section of a statement of financial position. Derivative contracts will be carried on the balance sheet at their mark-to-market value, 
with  the  change  in  value  flowing  to  either  net  income  or  comprehensive  income.  Gains  and  losses  on  instruments  that  are 
identified as hedges will flow initially to comprehensive income and be brought into net income at the time the underlying hedged
item is settled. It is expected that this standard will be effective for RedStar's 2007 reporting. Any instruments that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting will be marked-to-market with the adjustment (tax effected) flowing through the income statement. These 
pronouncements are not expected to have a significant impact on RedStar.
RedStar PrivateCo – June 30, 2005
The following discussion and analysis for RedStar PrivateCo's should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial and
operating information and RedStar PrivateCo's December 31, 2004 audited and June 30, 2005 unaudited consolidated financial 
statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.
This interim management discussion and analysis ("MD&A") for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was prepared on November 
24, 2005 and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and the year 
ended December 31, 2004.  The MD&A will discuss the results of RedStar PrivateCo as it existed in the first six months of 2005 
and  speaks  to  the  corporate  changes  to  RedStar  PrivateCo  subsequent  to  the  quarter  end  as  discussed  below.  Comparative 
quarterly information is not provided as RedStar PrivateCo was incorporated on September 22, 2004 and completed its first oil 
and gas transaction in the second quarter.
This MD&A is also for the period from incorporation on September 22, 2004 to December 31, 2004. During this period from 
incorporation  to  December  31,  2004  RedStar  PrivateCo  had  not  yet  commenced  oil  and  gas  operations.    RedStar  PrivateCo's 
activities to December 31, 2004 consisted of an initial financing where RedStar PrivateCo issued 65,150,100 common shares and 
62,200,000 flow-through common shares for total net proceeds of $5,533,727. For this period from incorporation to December 31, 
2004 RedStar PrivateCo had a net loss of $77,618 (nil per share) primarily related to general and administrative expenses incurred 
to commence business operations and office setup costs.
This MD&A refers to funds from operations, which is not a recognized measure under Canadian GAAP. Management believes 
that in addition to net income, funds from operations is a useful supplemental  measure as it demonstrates RedStar PrivateCo's 
ability to generate the cash necessary to repay debt or fund future growth through capital investment. The reconciliation between
net income and funds flow from operations can be found on the statements of cash flow in the interim financial statements and the
83
audited financial statements. Investors are cautioned that this  measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income
determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP  as  an  indication  of  RedStar  PrivateCo's  performance.  RedStar  PrivateCo's  method  of 
calculating  these  measures  may  differ  from  the  method  used  by  other  companies  and  accordingly,  may  not  be  comparable  to 
measures used by other companies.
For the purposes of calculating unit costs, natural gas has been converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) using 6,000 cubic feet 
of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil (6:1), unless otherwise stated. The Boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 Bbl is based on an 
energy equivalency conversion method and does not represent a value equivalency; therefore Boe's may be misleading if used in 
isolation. (This conversion conforms to NI 51-101).
Six Months Ending June 30, 2005
Highlights
On April 30, 2005, pursuant to two asset transfer agreements between RedStar PrivateCo and each of CPRL and Moriah, RedStar 
PrivateCo's acquired, on an income tax deferred basis pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the Tax Act, certain petroleum and natural
gas property interests in the Panny area of Alberta from both CPRL and Moriah for consideration of 11,914,285 common share 
and 15,300,000 common shares, respectively.  The shares were issued at a price of $0.07 per share, representing the estimated fair
market value of the Panny area assets acquired.
On May 3, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo acquired certain petroleum and natural gas production, property interests and a pending farm-
in agreement from a major Canadian oil and gas producer via an asset purchase agreement. The production, property interests and
pending  farm-in  lands  are  located  in  northeast  British  Columbia  and  northwest  Alberta.  This  acquisition  generated  immediate 
cash  flow  and  production  for  RedStar  PrivateCo's  and  has  provided  RedStar  PrivateCo  with  a  significant  and  promising  land 
position.  RedStar  PrivateCo  exchanged  these  assets  for  a  copy  of  a  proprietary  3-D  seismic  program  it  shot  in  the  2004/2005 
winter season. Total production from these assets as at June 30, 2005 was approximately 150 boe/d.
Pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated May 15, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of 
Resources  (2003)  for  consideration  of  11,971,429  common  shares.    The  shares  were  issued  at  a  price  of  $0.07  per  share, 
representing the estimated fair market value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. Resources (2003) has interests in Southern 
Alberta.  As at June 30, 2005, the Resources (2003) properties were producing approximately 20 bbls/d.
On  May  15,  2005,  the  shareholders  of  Pelorus  and  RedStar  PrivateCo  entered  into  an  amalgamation  agreement  whereby  each 
RedStar PrivateCo shareholder, other than Dissenting Shareholders received, in exchange for each twenty-five RedStar PrivateCo 
common shares held, 0.75 of a Common Share of the newly amalgamated company and 0.25 of a Non-Voting Share of the newly 
amalgamated company; each Pelorus Shareholder, other than Dissenting Shareholders received, in exchange for each twenty-five 
Pelorus Shares held , one Common Share of the newly amalgamated company; and each outstanding convertible debenture of 
Pelorus was exchanged for a comparable convertible debenture of the newly amalgamated company, having regard for the 25 to 1 
exchange ratio set forth in the amalgamation agreement.  On July 31, 2005 Pelorus and RedStar PrivateCo were amalgamated and 
continued business under the name of RedStar Oil & Gas Inc.

Operational review
Revenue
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, gas revenues were $549,093.  All of RedStar's PrivateCo's production during the six 
months  ended June  30, 2005  was  from  natural gas.  Production volumes  totalled  76,787  mcf  or 12,798  Boe. At  June 30, 2005 
RedStar PrivateCo's production volumes were approximately 300 boe/d which was in line with company expectations.
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, natural gas prices averaged $7.15/mcf.  RedStar PrivateCo markets its natural gas on the
spot market to a major marketer with all production inventory balances cleared at the end of each month. RedStar PrivateCo did 
not have any production hedges in place during the six months ended June 30, 2005.
Royalties
RedStar PrivateCo's total royalty encumbrance for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $104,000, consisting of both Crown 
and  overriding  royalties.  RedStar  PrivateCo's  royalty  rate  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2005  was  approximately  20%. 
RedStar expects this royalty rate to increase as additional wells are drilled on farm-in lands which will be encumbered with an
additional gross overriding royalty payable to the Farmor until payout is reached. None of RedStar PrivateCo's current production
is subject to the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit.
Operating Expenses
The overall operating costs for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $137,152 made up primarily of contract operator fees and
natural gas processing and transportation charges. On a per Boe basis operating costs were $10.72 per Boe which is 19% higher 
than RedStar PrivateCo's $9.00 per Boe forecast. RedStar PrivateCo expects operating costs on a unit of production basis to be 
closer to forecast as production volumes increase and more economies of scale are realized.
General and Administrative Expenses
General  and  administrative  expenses  totalled  $67,699  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2005  and  consisted  primarily  of 
accounting fees of $22,629, consulting fees of $139,795 and office set-up costs of $7,788, partially offset by overhead recoveries
relating  to  capital  projects  operated  by  RedStar  PrivateCo  totalling  $93,787.  RedStar  PrivateCo  does  not  capitalize  any  direct 
general and administrative charges.
Depletion, Depreciation and Accretion
Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expenses totalled $88,769, or $6.93 per Boe, for the first six months of 2005. 
$9.6 million of capital assets related to non-producing assets and seismic were excluded from the DD&A calculation. As these 
assets become developed and productive, the associated capital costs will be added into the depletable asset base.
Future Income Taxes
RedStar PrivateCo recorded a future income tax recovery of $132,664 for the six months ended June 30, 2005.  The income tax 
recovery was the result of a reduction in the expected income tax rates partially offset by expected future income taxes relating 
current period income.
85
Net Income and Funds from Operations
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $284,167. Net income for the period was positively impacted by the 
recognition of the future income tax recovery discussed above. Funds from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2005 
was $240,272.
Capital Expenditures
Net capital expenditures, for cash, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 totalled $10.5 million. Seismic costs accounted for $7.8 
million while property acquisitions totalled $3.3 million and completion and tie in costs were $1.8 million. These expenditures
were partially offset by a disposition of a copy of certain seismic data to an industry partner for $2.4 million. In addition, $2.7 
million worth of producing and non-producing properties were acquired for shares in RedStar.
Financial Resources and Liquidity
At June 30, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo had a strong balance sheet with cash reserves of $1,052,176, working capital of $1,162,496 
and no debt. RedStar currently has no long-term debt and expects to fund the balance of the currently defined 2005 exploration 
and development programs through working capital and cash flow through the year.
Share Capital
At  June  30,  2005,  RedStar  PrivateCo  had  outstanding  273,136,319  common  shares  and  81,000,000  common  share  purchase 
warrants.  Each  purchase  warrant  entitles  the  holder  to  purchase  one  common  share  of  RedStar  PrivateCo  for  $0.10  until 
December 31, 2009. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo issued for cash 106,600,505 Common Shares 
for  gross  proceeds  of  $7,462,026.    During  the  same  period  RedStar  PrivateCo  also  issued  39,185,714  common  shares  as 
consideration  for  the  acquisition  of  producing  and  non-producing  oil  and  gas  assets.  These  Common  Shares  were  valued  at 
$2,743,000 ($0.07 per share) which approximated the fair value of the assets acquired.
RedStar PrivateCo has a stock option plan, however at June 30, 2005 no stock options had been issued.
Related Party Transactions
Except as disclosed elsewhere, RedStar PrivateCo had the following related party transactions:
On June 30, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo owed $Nil (December 31, 2004 - $66,119) to a company controlled by a current director.
Included in accounts receivable as at June 30, 2005, is $744,450 (December 31, 2004 - $Nil) due from a company with common 
directors.
All related party transactions are in the normal course of operations and have been measured at the agreed to exchange amounts,
which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the related parties and which is similar to those negotiated with
third parties.
Commitments and Contingencies
Pursuant to flow-through financings completed in the year RedStar PrivateCo is committed to spending $5.6 million on qualified 
exploration and development expenditures by December 31, 2005. As at June 30, 2005, RedStar PrivateCo has expended all the 
qualified expenditures related to the financing.
The operations of RedStar PrivateCo are complex, and related tax interpretations, regulations and legislation affecting RedStar
PrivateCo are continually changing.  As a result, periodically, there may be some unusual matters under review. Although the 
ultimate impact of these matters on net earnings cannot be determined at this time, it could be material for any one quarter or year.
Risks and Uncertainties
The business of developing and producing oil and natural gas reserves is inherently risky.  There is risk that the sale of RedStar
PrivateCo's reserves may be delayed indefinitely due to process constraints, lack of pipeline capacity or lack of markets.  The
86
price RedStar PrivateCo receives for its oil and gas reserves fluctuates continuously and for the most part is beyond its control.  
RedStar PrivateCo is also subject to the risks associated with owning oil and gas properties, including environmental risks such as 
the  pollution  of  air,  land  and  water.    In  all  areas  of  RedStar  PrivateCo  business,  it  competes  against  entities  that  have  greater
technical and financial resources.  RedStar PrivateCo's growth is dependent upon external sources of financing which may not be
available on acceptable terms.
RedStar PrivateCo mitigates these risks by contracting professional services when required.  RedStar PrivateCo diversifies its oil 
and gas market portfolio among various marketers and aggregators and among a variety of contracts with respect to pricing and 
term.  Finally, all levels of RedStar PrivateCo's operations are adequately insured.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The  MD&A  is  based  on  RedStar  PrivateCo  consolidated  financial  statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
GAAP.  The application of GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, 
and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.    RedStar  PrivateCo  bases  its  estimates  on 
historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results
could  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different  assumptions  or  conditions.    The  following  is  a  discussion  of  the  critical 
accounting estimates that are inherent in the preparation of RedStar PrivateCo financial statements and notes thereto.
Reserve Estimates
Estimates  of  RedStar  PrivateCo's  reserves  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  guidelines  established  by  the  Alberta  Securities 
Commission.  Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of petroleum and natural gas 
that  cannot  be  measured  in  an  exact  manner.    The  process  relies  on  interpretations  of  available  geological,  geophysical, 
engineering and production data.  The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data, the 
interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the
estimate.
RedStar  PrivateCo's  reserve  information  is  based  on  estimates  prepared  by  its  independent  petroleum  consultants.    Estimates 
prepared by others may be different than these estimates.  Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which 
may  differ  from  actual  results,  reserve  estimates  may  be  different  from  the  quantities  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  that  are 
ultimately recovered.  In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify revisions 
to  the  estimate.    The  present  value  of  future  net  revenues  should  not  be  assumed  to  be  the  current  market  value  of  RedStar 
PrivateCo's estimated reserves.  Actual future prices, costs and reserves may be materially higher or lower than the prices, costs 
and reserves used for the future net revenue calculations.
The estimates of reserves impact depletion and site restoration expenses.  If reserve estimates decline, the rate at which RedStar
PrivateCo  records  depletion  and  site  restoration  expenses  increases,  reducing  net  earnings.    In  addition,  changes  in  reserve 
estimates may impact the outcome of RedStar PrivateCo's assessment of its petroleum and natural gas properties for impairment.
Kyoto
The Kyoto protocol, ratified by the Canadian Federal Government in December 2002, came into force on February 16, 2005. The 
protocol commits Canada to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to six percent below 1990 levels over the period 2008-2012. The 
Federal  Government  released  a  framework  outlining  its  Climate  Change  action  plan  on  April  13,  2005.  The  plan  as  released 
contains few technical details regarding the implementation of the Government's greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The Climate 
Change  Working  Group  of  Canadian  Association  of  Petroleum  Producers  continues  to  work  with  the  Federal  and  Alberta 
governments to develop an approach for implementing targets and enabling greenhouse gas control legislation, which protects the
industry's  competitiveness,  limits  the  cost  and  administrative  burden  of  compliance  and  supports  continued  investment  in  the 
sector. As  the federal  government  has  yet  to  release  a detailed  Kyoto  compliance  plan,  the  Company  is  unable  As the  federal 
government has yet to release a detailed Kyoto compliance plan, RedStar PrivateCo would face increases in operating costs in 
order to comply with the greenhouse gas emissions legislation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Impact of the Company
Comprehensive Income, Financial Instruments and Hedges
The CICA issued new standards in early 2005 for Comprehensive Income (CICA 1530), Financial Instruments (CICA 3855) and 
Hedges (CICA 3865), which will be effective for the reporting year-end 2007. The new standards will bring Canadian rules in 
line with current rules in the US. The standards will introduce the concept of "Comprehensive Income" to Canadian GAAP and 
will require that an enterprise (a) classify items of comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and (b) display 
the accumulated balance of comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity 
section of a statement of financial position. Derivative contracts will be carried on the balance sheet at their mark-to-market value, 
with  the  change  in  value  flowing  to  either  net  income  or  comprehensive  income.  Gains  and  losses  on  instruments  that  are 
identified as hedges will flow initially to comprehensive income and be brought into net income at the time the underlying hedged
item is settled. It is expected that this standard will be effective for RedStar's 2007 reporting. Any instruments that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting will be marked-to-market with the adjustment (tax effected) flowing through the income statement. These 
pronouncements currently do not impact RedStar.
Pelorus Energy Corp. – May 31, 2005
The following is management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") of Pelorus' audited operating and financial results for the year
ended May 31, 2005. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 
2005. The information provided in this MD&A is current as at September 28, 2005.
Presentation of Cash Flow From Operations
The financial data presented below has been prepared in accordance with GAAP except for the term cash flow from operations. 
Cash flow from operations has been presented for information purposes only and should not be considered an alternative to, or 
more meaningful than cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. Pelorus considers cash flow 
from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates Pelorus' ability to generate the cash necessary to repay debt and to fund
future growth through capital investments. The determination of Pelorus' cash flow from operations may not be comparable to the
same  reported  by  other  companies.  The  reconciliation  of  net  earnings  and  cash  flow  from  operations  can  be  found  in  the 
statements of cash flow in the financial statements. Cash flow from operations per share was calculated using the same weighted
average shares outstanding used in calculating net earnings per share.
Basis of Barrel of Oil Equivalent
For the purposes of calculating unit costs, natural gas has been converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) using 6,000 cubic feet 
of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil (6:1), unless otherwise stated. The Boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 Bbl is based on an 
energy equivalency conversion method and does not represent a value equivalency; therefore Boe's may be misleading if used in 
isolation. (This conversion conforms to NI 51-101).
Application of Critical Accounting Estimates
The  significant  accounting  policies  used  by  Pelorus  are  disclosed  in  Note  2  to  the  Audited  Financial  Statements  of  Pelorus 
included in this Prospectus. Certain accounting policies require that management make appropriate decisions with respect to the
formulation of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in 
these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on Pelorus' financial results and condition. The following discusses 
such accounting policies and is included in this MD&A to aid the reader in assessing the critical accounting policies and practices 
of Pelorus and the likelihood of materially different results being reported. Pelorus' management reviews its estimates regularly.
The emergence of new information and changed circumstances may result in actual results or changes to estimated amounts that 
differ materially from current estimates.
The following assessment of significant accounting policies is not meant to be exhaustive. Pelorus might realize different results
from the application of new accounting standards promulgated, from time to time, by various rule-making bodies.

Oil And Gas Reserves
Under NI 51-101, "Proved" reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable (it
is  likely  that  the  actual  remaining  quantities  recovered  will  exceed  the  estimated  Proved  reserves).  In  accordance  with  this 
definition,  the  level  of  certainty  targeted  by  the  reporting  company  should  result  in  at  least  a  90  percent  probability  that  the
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated reserves. In the case of "Probable" reserves, which are obviously 
less  certain  to  be  recovered  than  Proved  reserves,  NI  51-101  states  that  it  must  be  equally  likely  that  the  actual  remaining 
quantities  recovered  will  be  greater  or  less  than  the  sum  of  the  estimated  Proved  plus  Probable  reserves.  With  respect  to  the 
consideration of certainty, in order to report reserves as Proved plus Probable, the reporting company must believe that there is at 
least  a  50 percent  probability  that  the  quantities  actually  recovered will  equal or  exceed  the  sum  of  the  estimated  Proved plus
Probable  reserves.  The  implementation  of  NI  51-101  has  resulted  in  a  more  rigorous  and  uniform  standardization  of  Reserve 
evaluation. Proved plus Probable reserves as defined in NI 51-101 are viewed by many industry participants as being comparable 
to the "Established" reserves definition that was used historically. The oil and gas reserve estimates are made using all available
geological and reservoir data as well as historical production data. Estimates are reviewed and revised as appropriate. Revisions
occur  as  a  result  of  changes  in  prices,  costs,  fiscal  regimes,  reservoir  performance  or  a  change  in  Pelorus'  plans.  The  reserve
estimates are also used in determining Pelorus' borrowing base for its credit facilities and may impact the same upon revisions or 
changes to the reserves estimates. The effect of changes in proved oil and gas reserves on the financial results and position of
Pelorus is described as follows under the heading "Full Cost Accounting for Oil and Gas Activities".
Pelorus' proved reserves as of May 31, 2005 amounted to 28,800 barrels of oil equivalent. Proved plus probable reserves were 
39,200 Boe. All of Pelorus' reserves as at May 31, 2005, were evaluated by Sproule Associates Limited.
Additional reserve disclosure tables, as required under NI 51-101, are contained in the Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil
and  Gas  Information  FORM  51-101F1  filed  on  SEDAR.  The  reserve  estimates  contained  in  the  following  table  are  working 
interest reserves before and after deduction of royalties.

Depletion Expense
Pelorus follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all costs of exploring for and developing oil 
and gas reserves are capitalized whether successful or not. Such costs include land acquisition costs, geological and geophysical
expenses, carrying charges on non-producing properties, costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to exploration and 
acquisition activities.
Capitalized  costs  are  depleted  and  depreciated  using  the  unit-of-production  method  based  upon  gross  proved  petroleum  and 
natural gas reserves as determined by independent engineers. For purposes of the calculation, petroleum and natural gas reserves
are converted to a common unit of measure on the basis of their relative energy content, whereby one barrel of oil is equivalent to 
six thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  are  applied  against  capitalized  costs,  with  no  gain  or  loss 
recognized, unless such a sale would alter the rate of depletion by greater than twenty percent.
An increase in estimated proved oil and gas reserves would result in a corresponding reduction in depletion expense. A decrease
in estimated future development costs would result in a corresponding reduction in depletion expense.
Withheld Costs
Costs  of  acquiring  and  evaluating  unproved  properties  are  initially  excluded  from  depletion  calculations.  These  unevaluated 
properties  are  assessed  periodically  to  ascertain  whether  impairment  has  occurred.  When  proved  reserves  are  assigned  or  the 
property  is  considered  to  be  impaired,  the  cost  of  the  property  or  the  amount  of  the  impairment  is  added  to  costs  subject  to 
depletion calculations.
Full Cost Accounting Ceiling Test
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed quarterly for impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying 
value of the assets is not recoverable by the future undiscounted cash flows. The cost recovery ceiling test is based on estimates of 
proved reserves, production rate, petroleum and natural gas prices, future costs and other relevant assumptions. By their nature,
these  estimates  are  subject  to  measurement  uncertainty  and  the  impact  on  the  financial  statements  could  be  material.  Any 
impairment would be charged as additional depletion and depreciation expense.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Pelorus is required to provide for future removal and site restoration costs. Pelorus must estimate these costs in accordance with 
existing laws, contracts or other policies. These estimated costs are charged to earnings and the appropriate liability account over 
the  expected  service  life  of  the  asset.  When  the  future  removal  and  site  restoration  costs  cannot  be  reasonably  determined,  a 
contingent liability may exist. Contingent liabilities are charged to earnings when management is able to determine the amount 
and the likelihood of the future obligation.
Income Tax Accounting
The  determination  of  Pelorus  income  and  other  tax  liabilities  requires  interpretation  of  complex  laws  and  regulations  often 
involving multiple jurisdictions. All tax filings are subject to audit and potential reassessment after the lapse of considerable time. 
Accordingly, the actual income tax liability may differ significantly from that estimated and recorded by management.
Investment Tax Credits
Pelorus records investment tax credits on the cost reduction basis whereby investment tax credits related to current expenditures 
are included in the determination of net income in the year the tax credits meet the criteria of more likely than not realization.
Investment  tax  credits  related  to  the  acquisition  of  property  and  equipment  are  deducted  from  the  related  asset  values.  The 
investment tax credits will be utilized against future taxes payable. When the estimate is known to be materially different from the 
actual  recovery,  an  adjustment  is  made  to  net  income  in  the  period  the  determination  is  made.  The  effect  on  the  financial 
statements could be significant.
90
Legal, Environmental Remediation and Other Contingent Matters
Pelorus is required to both determine whether a loss is probable based on judgment and interpretation of laws and regulations and
determine that the loss can reasonably be estimated. When the loss is determined it is charged to earnings. Pelorus' management
must continually monitor known and potential contingent matters and make appropriate provisions by charges to earnings when 
warranted by circumstance.

Pelorus  began  active  operations  during  the  second  quarter  of  the  year  ended  May  31,  2005  as  an  oil  and  gas  exploration  and

Cash flow from operations has been presented for information purposes only and should not be considered an alternative to, or more 
meaningful  than  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  as  determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Pelorus  considers  cash  flow  from 
operations  to  be  a  key  measure  as  it  demonstrates  Pelorus'  ability  to  generate  the  cash  necessary  to  repay  debt  and  to  fund  future
growth  through  capital  investment.  The  determination  of  Pelorus'  cash  flow  from  operations  may  not  be  comparable  to  the  same 
reported by other companies. The reconciliation of net earnings and cash flow from operations can be found in the statements of cash 
flow in the consolidated financial statements. Cash flow from operations per share was calculated using the same weighted average
shares outstanding used in calculating net earnings per share.
The  net  income  before  taxes  for  the  year  ended  May  31,  2005  totalled  $72,104,  $0.00  per  share  basic  and  fully  diluted.  The 
weighted  number  of  basic  shares  outstanding  during  the  year  was  118,773,054.  The  income  was  mainly  due  to  a  $965,000 
recovery  of  investment  tax  credits,  partially  offset  by  general  and  administrative  expenses  of  $519,836,  largely  related  to  the
corporate  reorganization,  stock  based  compensation  of  $196,000  and  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  charges  of 
$134,319. Cash flow from operations for the year ended May 31, 2005 totalled $(488,260), $(0.00) cash flow per share basic and 
fully diluted.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capital Expenditures
During the year ended May 31, 2005, Pelorus recorded capital expenditures for cash totalling $14,850,657 including $106,207 of 
acquisition  costs  capitalized  and  $14,744,450  of  seismic  expenditures.  In  addition,  Pelorus  had  non-cash  capital  additions  of 
$1,011,900  of  capitalized  acquisition  costs  that  were  acquired  for  16,865,000  common  shares  of  Pelorus  and  $25,200  of 
additional asset retirement obligation asset. During the year, no general and administrative expenditures were capitalized. On May
17,  2005  Pelorus  announced  that  it  had  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  RedStar  Oil  &  Gas  Inc.  Pelorus  subsequently 
finalized its acquisition and after giving effect to a 1 for 25 share consolidation, issued a total of 8,194,125 common shares and
2,731,404 non voting common shares to effect the transaction.
Debt
Promissory  notes  in  the  amount  of  $500,000  are  payable  to  companies  controlled  by  two  former  insiders  of  Pelorus.  The 
promissory notes bear interest at a rate of 5 percent payable annually. As at May 31, 2005, Pelorus has no other outstanding debt 
instruments.

combination of bank debt, new equity, cash flow and working capital will allow Pelorus to conduct its 2005 budget. The majority
of 2005 capital will be spent in the final three months of the year. Planned 2005 capital expenditures will be adjusted to reflect 
unforeseen changes in commodity prices, exchange rates and interest rates from those used in the budgeting process.
Related Party Transactions
All  related  party  transactions  are  measured  at  the  exchange  amount,  which  is  the  amount  agreed  to  by  the  related  parties.  
Management  has  determined  that  these  amounts  approximate  fair  market  value.  Except  as  disclosed  elsewhere  in  the  Pelorus 
financial statements, Pelorus had the following related party transactions.
Effective October 29, 2004, Pelorus settled its previously outstanding debentures (the "Old Debentures") held by companies with
common  officers  and  directors.    The  debt  was  settled  with  an  assignment  of  a  $US600,000  aircraft  services  credit  and  the 
issuance, to the same related parties, of new convertible debentures (the "New Debentures") in the amount of $500,000.  For the
year ended May 31, 2005, Pelorus incurred total interest expense of $14,521 (2003 - $79,123) on the Old Debentures and the New

outstanding pursuant to the Old Debentures.
For the year ended May 31, 2005, consulting fees of $121,326 were paid to companies controlled by officers who were active 
during  the  year.    During  the  year  ended  May  31,  2005,  Pelorus  also  incurred  rent  expense  in  the  amount  of  $91,705  (2003  - 
$85,724) to a company with a common director, of which nil was owing at May 31, 2005. A company controlled by a current 
director was paid a consulting fee of $300,000 for services related to the restructuring of Pelorus.

Avenir Resources (2003) Ltd.
The following discussion and analysis for Resources (2003) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial and 
operating  information  and  Resources  (2003)'s  December  31,  2004  audited  and  June  30,  2005  unaudited  consolidated  financial 
statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this Prospectus.
This interim management discussion and analysis ("MD&A") for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was prepared on November 
24, 2005 and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and the year 
ended December 31, 2004.  The MD&A will discuss the results of Resources (2003) as it existed in the first six months of 2005 
and  speaks  to  the  corporate  changes  to  Resources  (2003)  subsequent  to  the  quarter  end  as  discussed  below.    Comparative 
quarterly information is not provided as Resources (2003) only completed its first oil and gas transaction in the third quarter of 
2004.  This MD&A is also for the year ended December 31, 2004.
This  MD&A  refers  to  funds  from  operations,  which  is  not  a  recognized  measure  under  GAAP.  Management  believes  that  in 
addition to net income, funds from operations is a useful supplemental measure as it demonstrates Resources (2003)'s ability to
generate  the  cash  necessary  to  repay  debt  or  fund  future  growth  through  capital  investment.  The  reconciliation  between  net 
income and funds flow from operations can be found on the statements of cash flow in the interim financial statements and the 
audited financial statements. Investors are cautioned that this  measure should not be construed as an alternative to net income
determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP  as  an  indication  of  Resources  (2003)'s  performance.  Resources  (2003)'s  method  of 
calculating  these  measures  may  differ  from  the  method  used  by  other  companies  and  accordingly,  may  not  be  comparable  to 
measures used by other companies.
For the purposes of calculating unit costs, natural gas has been converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) using 6,000 cubic feet 
of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil (6:1), unless otherwise stated. The Boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 Bbl is based on an 
energy equivalency conversion method and does not represent a value equivalency; therefore Boe's may be misleading if used in 
isolation. (This conversion conforms to NI 51-101).
Year Ending December 31, 2004
Resources  (2003)'s  equity  activities  to  December  31,  2004  consisted  of  an  initial  financing  activities  where  Resources  (2003) 
issued 277,878 common shares and 120,000 flow-through common shares for total net proceeds of $370,001. Resources (2003)'s 
first oil and gas operations commenced in the third quarter of 2004 with the commencement of oil and gas production occurring in
the fourth quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Resources (2003) had gross revenues of $79,797 primarily related to net 
natural  gas  sales  of  approximately  200  mcf/d.  Royalties  for  the period  were  $26,259,  and  consisted  of  both  Crown  and  Gross 
Overriding  royalty  encumbrances.  Operating  expenses  totalled  $17,664  in  2004  and  primarily  consisted  of  natural  gas 
transportation  and  processing  fees.  In  2004,  Resources  (2003)  incurred  general  and  administration  costs  of  $7,008  related 
primarily to consulting fees and office expenses and recorded $52,458 in depletion, depreciation and accretion charges relating to 
the production identified above. These operations resulted in a net loss before income taxes of $23,592 and after recording the
related future income tax recovery of $8,440, Resources (2003) recorded a net loss of $15,152 for the year ended December 31, 
2004.

Six Months Ending June 30, 2005
Highlights
Pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated May 15, 2005, RedStar, a private oil and gas company, acquired all the issued and 
outstanding shares of Resources (2003) for consideration of 11,971,429 Common Shares.  The shares were issued at a price of 
$0.07  per  share,  representing  the  estimated  fair  market  value  of  the  net  assets  and  liabilities  acquired.  Resources  (2003)  has 
interests in Southern Alberta.  As at June 30, 2005, the Resources (2003) properties were producing approximately 20 boe/d.
On  May  15,  2005,  the  shareholders  of  Pelorus  and  RedStar  entered  into  an  amalgamation  agreement  whereby  each  RedStar 
Shareholder, other than Dissenting Shareholder received, in exchange for each twenty-five common shares of (pre-amalgamation) 
RedStar held, 0.75 of a common share of the newly amalgamated company and 0.25 of a non-voting common share of the newly 
amalgamated company; each Pelorus Shareholder, other than Dissenting Shareholders received, in exchange for each twenty-five 
common  shares  of  Pelorus  held  ,  one  common  share  of  the  newly  amalgamated  company;  and  each  outstanding  convertible 
debenture of Pelorus was exchanged for a comparable convertible debenture of the newly amalgamated company, having regard 
for the 25 to 1 exchange ratio set forth in the amalgamation agreement.  On July 31, 2005 Pelorus and RedStar were amalgamated 
and continued business under the name of RedStar Oil & Gas Inc.

As Resources (2003) was only incorporated on December 12, 2003, and had no significant operations prior to October 1, 2004, 
summary financial information for quarters ending prior to October 1, 2004 are not meaningful.
Operational review
Revenue
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, oil and gas revenues were $162,096.  Substantially all of Resources (2003)'s production
during the six months ended June 30, 2005 was from natural gas. Production of natural gas volumes totalled 21,726 mcf or 3,621 
boe  and  production  of  NGL's  totalled  157  bbls  for  total  production  of  3,778  boe.  At  June  30,  2005  the  company's  production 
volumes were approximately 30 boe/d which was in line with company expectations.
For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2005,  natural  gas  prices  averaged  $7.20/mcf  while  NGL  prices  averaged  $36.36/bbl.  
Resources (2003) markets its natural gas on the spot market to a major marketer with all production inventory balances cleared at
the end of each month. Resources (2003) did not have any production hedges in place during the six months ended June 30, 2005.
96
Royalties
Resources (2003)'s total royalty encumbrance for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $59,332, consisting of both Crown and 
overriding royalties. Resources (2003) royalty rate for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was approximately 37%. Resources 
(2003) expects this royalty rate to remain relatively constant into the future assuming relatively constant commodity prices. The 
majority of Resources (2003)'s current production qualifies for the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit which under current commodity 
prices provides for a tax credit equivalent to 25% of the Alberta crown royalties paid in a given period.
Operating Expenses
The overall operating costs for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $10,535 made up primarily of contract operator fees and 
natural gas processing and transportation charges. On a per boe basis operating costs were $2.78 per Boe which is lower than the
industry  average.  Resources  (2003)  expects  operating  costs  on  a  unit  of  production  basis  to  remain  relatively  constant  in  the 
future.
General and Administrative Expenses
General  and  administrative  expenses  totalled  $32,975  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2005  and  consisted  primarily  of 
accounting  fees  of  $30,000  and  consulting  fees  of  $2,493.  Resources  (2003)  does  not  capitalize  any  direct  general  and 
administrative charges.
Depletion, Depreciation and Accretion
Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&A) expenses totalled $101,539, or $26.88 per boe, for the first six months of 2005.
These higher than average depletion charges are expected to reduce in the future as existing probable reserves are developed and
moved into the proven reserve category.
Future Income Taxes
Resources (2003) recorded a future income tax recovery of $15,358 for the six months ended June 30, 2005.  The income tax 
recovery was primarily the result of the tax effect relate to the current period loss.
Net Income (loss) and funds from operations
Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $26,927. The net loss for the period was primarily due to the high DD&A 
charges which were partially offset by the recognition of the future income tax recovery discussed above. Funds from operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $59,254.
Capital Expenditures
Net capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2005 totalled $90,858. Essentially all of the capital expenditures in the 
period were related to completion and tie in costs for the Queenstown 13-26 well which accounts for the majority of Resources 
(2003)'s current production.
Financial Resources and Liquidity
At  June  30,  2005,  Resources  (2003)  had  a  working  capital  deficit  of  $31,253  which  represents  less  than  0.3  times  annualized 
cashflow. Resources (2003) has no long-term debt and would expect to fund the balance of the currently defined 2005 exploration
and development programs through operating cash flow. At June 30, 2005, Resources (2003) had outstanding 764,545 common 
shares and had committed to issue a further 444,444 common shares to a company controlled by directors and officers pursuant to
the acquisition agreement with RedStar During the six months ended June 30, 2005, Resources (2003) issued 366,667 common 
shares at $0.90 per share to a related party as consideration for settlement of a promissory note.
Resources (2003) does not have a stock option plan.
97
Risks and Uncertainties
The business of developing and producing oil and natural gas reserves is inherently risky.  There is risk that the sale of Resources 
(2003)'s reserves may be delayed indefinitely due to process constraints, lack of pipeline capacity or lack of markets.  The price
Resources  (2003)  receives  for  its  oil  and  gas  reserves  fluctuates  continuously  and  for  the  most  part  is  beyond  its  control.  
Resources (2003) is also subject to the risks associated with owning oil and gas properties, including environmental risks such as 
the  pollution  of  air,  land  and  water.    In  all  areas  of  Resources  (2003)  business,  it  competes  against  entities  that  have  greater
technical and financial resources.  Resources (2003)'s growth is dependent upon external sources of financing which may not be 
available on acceptable terms.
Resources (2003) mitigates these risks by contracting professional services when required.  Resources (2003) diversifies its oil
and gas market portfolio among various marketers and aggregators and among a variety of contracts with respect to pricing and 
term.  Finally, all levels of Resources (2003)'s operations are adequately insured.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The  MD&A  is  based  on  Resources  (2003)'s  consolidated  financial  statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with 
GAAP.  The application of GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements, 
and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.    Resources  (2003)  bases  its  estimates  on 
historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results
could  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different  assumptions  or  conditions.    The  following  is  a  discussion  of  the  critical 
accounting estimates that are inherent in the preparation of Resources (2003)'s financial statements and notes thereto.
Reserve Estimates
Estimates  of  Resources  (2003)'s  reserves  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  guidelines  established  by  the  Alberta  Securities 
Commission.  Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of petroleum and natural gas 
that  cannot  be  measured  in  an  exact  manner.    The  process  relies  on  interpretations  of  available  geological,  geophysical, 
engineering and production data.  The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data, the 
interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the
estimate.
Resources  (2003)'s  reserve  information  is  based  on  estimates  prepared  by  its  independent  petroleum  consultants.    Estimates 
prepared by others may be different than these estimates.  Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which 
may  differ  from  actual  results,  reserve  estimates  may  be  different  from  the  quantities  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  that  are 
ultimately recovered.  In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify revisions 
to  the  estimate.    The present  value  of  future  net  revenues  should not be  assumed  to be  the  current market  value of  Resources 
(2003)'s estimated reserves.  Actual future prices, costs and reserves may be materially higher or lower than the prices, costs and 
reserves used for the future net revenue calculations.
The estimates of reserves impact depletion and site restoration expenses.  If reserve estimates decline, the rate at which Resources 
(2003) records depletion and site restoration expenses increases, reducing net earnings.  In addition, changes in reserve estimates 
may impact the outcome of Resources (2003)'s assessment of its petroleum and natural gas properties for impairment.
Kyoto
The Kyoto protocol, ratified by the Canadian Federal Government in December 2002, came into force on February 16, 2005. The 
protocol commits Canada to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to six percent below 1990 levels over the period 2008-2012. The 
Federal  Government  released  a  framework  outlining  its  Climate  Change  action  plan  on  April  13,  2005.  The  plan  as  released 
contains few technical details regarding the implementation of the Government's greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The Climate 
Change  Working  Group  of  Canadian  Association  of  Petroleum  Producers  continues  to  work  with  the  Federal  and  Alberta 
governments to develop an approach for implementing targets and enabling greenhouse gas control legislation, which protects the
industry's  competitiveness,  limits  the  cost  and  administrative  burden  of  compliance  and  supports  continued  investment  in  the 
sector. As the federal government has yet to release a detailed Kyoto compliance plan, Resources (2003) is unable to predict the
impact of potential regulations upon its business; however, it is possible that the Company would face increases in operating costs 
in order to comply with the greenhouse gas emissions legislation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Impact of the Company
Comprehensive Income, Financial Instruments and Hedges
The  CICA  issued  new  standards  in  early  2005  for  Comprehensive  Income  (1530),  Financial  Instruments  (CICA  3855)  and 
Hedges (CICA 3865), which will be effective for the reporting year-end 2007. The new standards will bring Canadian rules in 
line with current rules in the US. The standards will introduce the concept of "Comprehensive Income" to Canadian GAAP and 
will require that an enterprise (a) classify items of comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and (b) display 
the accumulated balance of comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity 
section of a statement of financial position. Derivative contracts will be carried on the balance sheet at their mark-to-market value, 
with  the  change  in  value  flowing  to  either  net  income  or  comprehensive  income.  Gains  and  losses  on  instruments  that  are 
identified as hedges will flow initially to comprehensive income and be brought into net income at the time the underlying hedged
item is settled. It is expected that this standard will be effective for Resources (2003)'s 2007 reporting. Any instruments that do 
not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  will  be  marked-to-market  with  the  adjustment  (tax  effected)  flowing  through  the  income 
statement. Management does not currently expect these pronouncements to have a significant effect on the Company.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of the Special Warrants are estimated to be $41,940,348 after deducting the Underwriters' fee
of $2,706,082 (being 6.0% of the gross proceeds) and the estimated expenses of the offering of $454,940.  The net proceeds will

Until  the  above  funds  are  required  for  the  purpose  set  out  above,  they  will  be  included  in  the  general  working  capital  of  the 
Corporation.  We intend to spend the net proceeds as described above.  There may be circumstances, however, where, for sound 
business reasons, a reallocation of funds may be necessary.
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Pursuant  to  the  Underwriting  Agreement,  the  Underwriters  were  appointed  to  act  as  our  exclusive  agents  to  offer  for  sale  the 
Special Warrants subject to the terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement.  On November 15, 2005, we completed a 
private  placement  of  4,925,900  Common  Share  Special  Warrants  and  9,636,800  Flow-Through  Special  Warrants  at  $2.70  and 
$3.30 per Special Warrant, respectively.  The Underwriters received a fee of $2,706,082, being 6.0% of the gross proceeds raised,
for  acting  as  Underwriters  in  this  offering.    The  price  of  the  Common  Share  Special  Warrants  and  Flow-Through  Special 
Warrants was determined through negotiations among us and the Underwriters.
This Prospectus is being filed in the Filing Provinces to qualify the distribution of the 14,562,700 Common Shares to be issued
upon the exercise of the Special Warrants.  14,562,700 Common Shares obtained on the exercise or deemed exercise of Special 
Warrants prior to the issuance of a final receipt for this Prospectus will be subject to applicable hold periods under applicable 
securities legislation.
The  Special  Warrants  were  created  pursuant  to  and  are  governed  by  the  terms  of  the  Special  Warrant  Indenture  between  the 
Corporation and the Trustee.  Since the date of issuance, no Special Warrants have been exercised.  Each Special Warrant entitles 
the holder to acquire, at no additional cost, one Common Share until the Expiry Time.  Any Special Warrants not exercised prior
to the Expiry Time shall be deemed to be exercised at the Expiry Time without any further action on the part of the holder.
The Special Warrant Indenture provides that, in the event of certain alterations of the Common Shares, including any subdivision,
consolidation, reclassification, and in the event of any form of reorganization of the Corporation, including any amalgamation,
merger or arrangement, an adjustment will be made to the terms of the Special Warrants such that holders shall, upon exercise of
the  Special  Warrants  following  the  occurrence  of  any  of  these  events,  be  entitled  to  receive  the  same  number  and  kind  of 
securities  to  which  they  would  have  been  entitled  had  they  exercised  their  Special  Warrants  prior  to  the  occurrence  of  those 
events.  The holding of Special Warrants does not constitute the holder thereof a shareholder of the Corporation or entitle the
holder to any right of interest in respect thereof except as expressly provided in the Special Warrant Indenture.
This Prospectus is being filed in the Filing Jurisdictions to qualify the distribution of the Common Shares to be issued upon the
exercise  of  the  Special  Warrants.    All  of  the  outstanding  Common  Shares  and  non-voting  Common  Shares  are  fully  paid  and 
non-assessable, and the Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Special Warrants, when issued, will be fully paid and 
non-assessable.  See "Consolidated Capitalization".

RedStar  has  obtained  conditional  approval  from  the  TSXV  to  list  the  Common  Shares  issuable  upon  the  exercise  or  deemed 
exercise of the Special Warrants.  Listing will be subject to RedStar fulfilling all the listing requirements of the TSXV.
The Common Shares offered hereby have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, (the "1933 Act") or any state securities laws, and accordingly may not be offered or sold within the United States or to
U.S. persons (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the 1933 Act) except in transactions exempt from the registration 
requirements of the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws.  The Underwriting Agreement permits the Underwriters to offer
and resell the Common Shares that they have acquired pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement to certain qualified institutional 
buyers and accredited investors in the United States, provided such offers and sales are made in accordance with Rule 144A under
the 1933 Act or another exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act.  Moreover, the Underwriting Agreement 
provides  that  the  Underwriters  will  offer  and  sell  the  Common  Shares  outside  the  United  States  only  in  accordance  with 
Regulation S under the 1933 Act.
In  addition,  until  40  days  after  the  commencement  of  the  offering,  an  offer  or  sale  of  Common  Shares  offered  under  this 
Prospectus  within  the  United  States  by  any  dealer  (whether  or  not  participating  in  the  offering)  may  violate  the  registration 
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.
DIVIDEND RECORD AND POLICY
We have not declared or paid any dividends on the Common Shares since incorporation.  Any decision to pay dividends on the 
Common Shares will be made by our Board of Directors on the basis of our earnings, financial requirements and other conditions 
existing at such future time.
In  the preceding  12  months,  the only  Common  Shares  issued  by  RedStar  (or  a predecessor  in  interest  to  RedStar),  are  set out

Corporate Cease Trade Orders or Bankruptcies
Other than as set out below, no director or officer of RedStar or shareholder holding a sufficient number of securities of RedStar
to effect materially the control of RedStar is, or within ten years before the date of this document, has been, a director, officer or 
promoter of any other issuer that, while that person was acting in that capacity, was the subject of a cease trade or similar order, or
103
an order that denied the issuer access to any statutory exemption, for a period of more than thirty consecutive days, or became
bankrupt,  made  a  proposal  under  any  legislation  relating  to  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  or  was  subject  to  or  instituted  any 
proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors or had a receiver, receiver-manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets.
Jeff  Lawson  has  been  a  director  of  BakBone  Software  Incorporated  ("BakBone")  since  2000.    In  October,  2004,  BakBone 
announced that it had approved the engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP as BakBone's independent public accountants, who 
would  replace  KPMG  LLP,  who  were  BakBone's  previous  independent  public  accounts.    As  a  result  of  this  change  of 
accountants,  and  the  requirement  for  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP  to  both  review  BakBone's  current  results  and  its  previously 
published financial statements, the Company was not in a position to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the September 30,
2004  period  and  consequently,  in  December  2004,  each of  the  Alberta,  British  Columbia  and  Ontario  Securities Commissions 
issued cease trade orders against the Company to the effect that all trading in the securities of BakBone cease until it has filed its 
requisite financial statements in accordance with Canadian securities legislation.
Penalties or Sanctions
To our knowledge, no director or officer of RedStar, or a shareholder holding sufficient securities of RedStar to effect materially
the control of RedStar, has been subject to any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to Canadian securities legislation 
or by a Canadian securities regulatory authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a Canadian securities regulatory 
authority  relating  to  trading  in  securities,  promotion  or  management  of  a  publicly  traded  issuer  or  theft  or  fraud,  or  has  been
subject to any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or a regulatory body that would be likely to be considered important 
to a reasonable investor making an investment decision.
Personal Bankruptcies
To our knowledge, no director, officer or promoter of RedStar or a shareholder holding sufficient securities of RedStar to effect
materially the control of RedStar, or personal holding company of any such person has within ten years before the date of this 
Prospectus become bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency or been subject to or 
instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to 
hold the assets of the director, officer or promoter.

notice of exercise (the "Put Notice") by us, over the exercise price for each option being purchased under the Put Right.

PROMOTERS
Messrs. Al Kroonjte, a former director and shareholder of the Corporation, and J. Fredrick Welter, a former officer, director and
indirect  shareholder  of  the  Corporation,  may  be  considered  to  be  former  promoters  of  the  Corporation  in  that  they  took  the 
initiative in reorganizing the business of the Corporation into that of an oil and gas issuer, arranging for the acquisition by Pelorus 
from arm's length vendors of (i) certain oil and gas assets in the Verger area of southern Alberta for aggregate consideration of
$1,011,900,  subject  to  adjustment,  payable  by  the  issuance  of  16,865,000  (pre  consolidated)  common  shares  of  Pelorus  at  a 
deemed  price  of  $0.06  per  share;  and  (ii)  the  acquisition  of  certain  additional  oil  and  gas  assets  located  in  the  Gilby,  Hays, 
Leahurst and Provost areas of Alberta for aggregate consideration of $110,000, subject to adjustment.
North West, a private company owned as to 53.1% by Telford Services Group Inc. ("Telford") and 41% by J. Fredrick Welter, 
originally purchased $1,234,109 principal amount of the outstanding debentures of Pelorus in July, 2003.  Effective August 1, 
2004, Telford purchased an aggregate of $617,055 principal amount of the debentures from North West such that North West and 
Telford each owned 50% of the outstanding debentures.
J.  Fredrick  Welter  and  Al  Kroonjte,  a  former  director  and  shareholder  of  Pelorus  were,  directly  or  indirectly,  the  principal 
shareholders of North West and Telford.  Al Kroonjte was also a director, officer and principal shareholder of Telford.
On  January  23,  2004,  Pelorus  concluded  a  private  placement  of  7,000,000  units  of  Pelorus  at  a  price  of  $0.05  per  unit  (pre-
consolidated), each unit consisting of one (1) common share and one-third (1/3) of one purchase warrant each warrant exercisable
106
at a price of $0.10 per share (pre consolidated) until January 23, 2005.  Mr. Kroonjte acquired directly 2,300,000 of such units,
Telford acquired 3,000,000 of such units and North West acquired 1,500,000 of such units.
At the time of completion of the oil and gas acquisitions:
•
•
•
•
North  West  and  Telford  held  $1,234,109  principal  amount  (plus  accrued  interest  to  May  31,  2004  of  $102,360)  of 
outstanding debentures, which were repaid through the assignment to North West and Telford of a (i) US $600,000 credit 
with  Honeywell  International  Inc.'s  Garrett  Engine  Overhaul  Division  entitling  the  holder  to  a  US  $600,000  credit 
against  the  costs  of  overhauling  certain  turboprop  engines;  plus  (ii)  issuance  to  North  West  and  Telford  of  $500,000 
principal amount of convertible debentures, such debentures convertible at the option of the holders into common shares 
on the basis of one (1) common share of Pelorus (pre consolidated) for each $0.06 of principal amount of debentures;
at such time, Mr. Kroonjte owned, directly or indirectly, or exercised control or direction over, an aggregate of 6,800,000 
common shares (pre-consolidated), representing approximately 37.9% of the then issued and outstanding common shares 
of Pelorus, prior to giving effect to the above acquisitions and a concurrent private placement financing being completed 
by Pelorus at such time;
the shares were held as to 2,300,000 common shares of Pelorus directly, 2,300,000 common shares indirectly, through 
Telford and 1,500,000 common shares indirectly, through North West; and
Based  on  publicly  available  information,  Mr.  Kroonjte  presently  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  an  aggregate  of  55,200 
Common Shares, representing approximately 0.29% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of the Corporation, 
North West Geomatics Ltd. holds, directly or indirectly, 45,000 Common Shares, representing approximately 0.24% of 
the issued and outstanding Common Shares and Telford Services Group Inc. holds, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of 
90,000  Common  Shares,  representing  approximately  0.48%  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  Common  Shares  of  the 
Corporation.
CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
In the opinion of Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP ("Counsel"), the following is a fair and adequate summary of the principal 
Canadian  federal  income  tax  considerations  relevant  to  an  investment  in  Special  Warrants  to  subscribers  who,  at  all  relevant 
times, are individuals or corporations resident or deemed to be resident in Canada, deal at arm's length with the Corporation and
who hold the Special Warrants and will hold the Common Shares as capital property, all within the meaning of the Tax Act.  The 
Special Warrants  and  the  Common  Shares  will  each  generally  constitute  capital  property  to  a  holder  thereof unless the  holder 
holds such securities in the course of carrying on the business of trading or dealing in securities or otherwise as part of a business 
of buying and selling securities or has acquired such securities in a transaction or transactions considered to be an adventure in the 
nature of trade.
This summary is not applicable to subscribers; (i) who are principal business corporations within the meaning of the Tax Act; (ii)
whose business includes trading or dealing in rights, licences or privileges to explore for, drill or take minerals, oil, natural gas or 
other related hydrocarbons; (iii) an interest in which would be a "tax shelter investment" as defined in the Tax Act; (iv) who are 
subject to the "mark-to-market" provisions of the Tax Act; (v) who are partnerships or trusts, (iv) who are "financial institutions"; 
or (vii) who are "specified financial institutions" for purposes of the Tax Act.
This  summary  is  based  on  the  Tax  Act  and  the  regulations  enacted  thereunder  (the  "Regulations")  taking  into  account  all 
published  proposals  for  the  amendments  thereof  to  the  date  hereof  (the  "Proposed  Amendments")  and  upon  Counsel's 
understanding  of  the  current administrative  practices  of  the  Customs  and  Revenue  Agency  ("CRA").   This  summary  does  not 
otherwise take into account or anticipate any change in law or administrative practice, nor does it take into account provincial or 
territorial tax laws of Canada or tax laws of any foreign country.  No assurances can be given that the Proposed Amendments to 
the Tax Act and the Regulations will be enacted as proposed, if at all, or that legislative, judicial or administrative changes will 
not modify or change the statements expressed herein.
This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice to 
any  particular  subscriber.    Accordingly,  potential  subscribers  should  consult  their  own  tax  advisors  for  advice  with 
respect  to  the  income  tax  consequences  of  investing  in  Special  Warrants  having  regard  to  their  own  particular 
circumstances.
107
This summary assumes that the Corporation will make all filings in respect of the issue of the Flow-Through Special Warrants 
and the renunciation of Qualifying Expenditures in the manner and within the time required by the Tax Act and the Regulations 
and that all renunciations will be validly made.  In addition, while the Corporation will furnish each subscriber with information 
with respect to renounced Qualifying Expenditures for purposes of filing income tax returns, the preparation and filing of returns 
will remain the responsibility of each subscriber.  This summary is based upon the assurance of the Corporation that it will be a 
"principal  business  corporation"  at  all  material  times  and  that  the  Flow-Through  Special  Warrants,  when  issued,  will  not  be 
"prescribed shares" or "prescribed rights", all within the meaning of the Tax Act.  The purpose of the prescribed share rules is to 
prevent renunciation of resource expenses where an investor's risk of loss in respect of the share may be limited in any manner.  If 
any  of  the  above  assumptions  are  incorrect,  the  Corporation  may  be  unable  to  renounce  some  or  all  of  the  Qualifying 
Expenditures which it has agreed to renounce hereunder.
The federal income tax consequences to a particular subscriber of his or her investment in Special Warrants hereunder will vary
according to a number of factors including the particular province in which the subscriber resides, carries on business or has a
permanent  establishment,  the  legal  characterization  of  the  subscriber  as  an  individual,  corporation,  trust  or  partnership,  the 
amount  that  would  be  the  subscriber's  taxable  income  but  for  his  or  her  investment  in  the  Special  Warrants,  the  length  of  a 
subscriber's fiscal period and the manner in which the proceeds for the Special Warrants are expended.
Flow-Through Special Warrants Qualifying Expenditures
The  Corporation  will  be  entitled  to  renounce  Qualifying  Expenditures  incurred  by  it  during  the  Expenditure  Period  to 
Flow-Through Special Warrant subscribers as permitted by and in accordance with Tax Act.  Such Qualifying Expenditures as are 
properly  renounced  to  a  subscriber  will  be  deemed  to  have  been  incurred  by  that  subscriber  on  the  effective  date  of  the 
renunciation.  The computation of the amount that the Corporation will be entitled to renounce to subscribers of Flow-Through 
Special  Warrants  is  complex.    Generally  speaking,  however,  the  Corporation  will  be  entitled  to  renounce  the  amount  of 
Qualifying Expenditures incurred by it after closing, excluding certain assistance received in respect of the expenditures, most
overhead  expenditures  and  the  cost  of  certain  seismic  data.    The  Corporation  will  not  be  entitled  to  renounce  CEE  where  the 
amounts renounced, if the renunciation was effective, would exceed the Corporation's cumulative CEE ("CCEE").  Qualifying 
Expenditures that  may be renounced are also restricted to the amount of Qualifying Expenditures the Corporation would have 
otherwise been entitled to deduct in computing its income.
The Tax Act contains a one year "look-back" rule which, if certain conditions are satisfied, entitles the Corporation to have CEE 
incurred by it  before the end of a particular calendar year renounced to subscribers effective on the last day of the immediate
preceding calendar year.  In other words, the subscribers are deemed to have incurred the CEE on the last day of a calendar year
even though the Corporation did not incur the expenditures until the next year.  For this rule to apply, the subscriber must have
entered into the Flow-Through Special Warrant subscription agreement and paid the consideration in money for the share before 
the last day of the calendar year in which the Qualifying Expenditures are effectively renounced and must deal at arm's length 
with the Corporation throughout the following calendar year.  In the event that the Corporation does not fully expend the amounts
renounced under the one year "look-back" rule by the end of the calendar year following the year of renunciation, the Corporation
will be required to reduce the amount of expenditures renounced to the subscribers and the subscribers' income tax returns for the 
years in which the expenditures were claimed will be reassessed accordingly.
A subscriber may deduct in computing such subscriber's income from all sources for a taxation year an amount not exceeding 
100% of the balance of such subscriber's CCEE account, at the end of that taxation year.  Deductions claimed by a subscriber 
reduce  the  CCEE  account  in  the  year  deductions  are  claimed.    The  right  to  deduct  CCEE  accrues  to  the  initial  purchaser  of 
Flow-Through  Special  Warrants  and  is  not  transferable.    To  the  extent  that  a  subscriber  does  not  deduct  the  balance  of  such 
subscriber's  CCEE  account  at  the  end  of  the  taxation  year,  the  balance  may  be  carried  forward  and  deducted  in  subsequent 
taxation years in accordance with the provisions of the Tax Act.
Certain restrictions apply in respect of the deduction of CCEE following an acquisition of control and on certain reorganizations 
of a corporate subscriber.  Corporate subscribers should consult their own independent tax advisors for advice with respect to the 
potential application of these rules to them having regard to their own particular circumstances.
Qualifying  Expenditures  that  may  be  renounced  are  also  restricted  to  the  amount  of  Qualifying  Expenditures  the  Corporation 
would have otherwise been entitled to deduct in computing its income.  However, the CRA's published administrative position is 
that  this  restriction  would  not  apply  merely  because  the  Corporation  has  insufficient  income  to  otherwise  claim  the  CEE 
deduction.
108
Where Qualifying Expenditures have been renounced but it is subsequently determined that such Qualifying Expenditures were 
not properly renounced or the Corporation has failed to incur the Qualifying Expenditures before December 31, 2006, there may 
be an adjustment in the amounts previously renounced to a subscriber and the subscriber may be reassessed.  However, no penalty
will be assessed against such subscriber and interest in respect of additional tax payable under the Tax Act by a subscriber will
generally not be levied in respect of such reassessment until after April, 2007.
Disposition of Common Shares
A disposition or deemed disposition of a Common Share (other than to the Corporation) will result in the realization of a capital
gain or capital loss in the taxation year of the disposition equal to the amount by which the proceeds of disposition exceed or are 
less than, respectively, the adjusted cost base of such share and reasonable expenses incurred by the subscriber for the purposes of 
making such disposition.  The cost for tax purposes of Common Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of Special Warrants will
be the adjusted cost base of the Special Warrants.  In computing the adjusted cost base of a holder's Common Shares acquired 
pursuant to the exercise of the Special Warrants, the cost base of such Common Shares must be averaged with the cost of any 
other Common Shares of the Corporation held as capital property at the time.  One-half of any capital gain (a taxable capital gain) 
must be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for the year in which the disposition takes place, while one-half of any
capital  loss  (an  allowable  capital  loss)  will  generally  be  required  to  be  deducted  against  taxable  capital  gains  realized  by  the
subscriber in the same taxation year.  Allowable capital losses not deducted in the year in which they arise may be deducted by a 
taxpayer from taxable capital gains realized in the year, any of the three preceding years, or any subsequent year, subject to the 
detailed provisions of the Tax Act in that regard.
A subscriber that is a "Canadian controlled private corporation" (as defined in the Tax Act) will be liable to pay an additional 6 
2/3% refundable tax on its "aggregate investment income" for the year which is defined to include an amount in respect of taxable
capital  gains.    A  subscriber  for  Flow-Through  Special  Warrants  who  disposes  of  Common  Shares  acquired  pursuant  to  the 
exercise of the Flow-Through Special Warrants will retain the entitlement to the renunciation of Qualifying Expenditures from the
Corporation as described above as well as the ability to deduct any CCEE not previously deducted, and a subsequent purchaser of
such Common Shares will not be entitled to such renunciations.
Exercise or Disposition of Special Warrants
The Common Share Special Warrants will have a cost for tax purposes equal to their original subscription amount.  A holder will
not  realize  a  gain  or  loss  upon  the  exercise  or  deemed  exercise  of  Special  Warrants  to  acquire  Common  Shares.    The  Flow-
Through Special Warrants will be deemed to have a cost of nil.  The cost of the Common Share Warrants and the cost of the 
Flow-Through Special Warrants held by a subscriber at any time will be averaged in order to determine the adjusted cost base of
the Special Warrants at that time.
A  subsequent  disposition  or  deemed  disposition  of  Special  Warrants  (other  than  on  the  exercise  of  such  Special  Warrants  to 
acquire Common Shares) will result in the realization of a capital gain (or capital loss) in the taxation year of the disposition to the 
extent the proceeds of disposition exceed (are exceeded by) the aggregate of the adjusted cost base of such Special Warrants and
reasonable disposition costs.  Any taxable capital gain or allowable capital loss so realized will be subject to the same treatment as 
described above under "Disposition of Common Shares".
Minimum Tax
Pursuant to the minimum tax rules, the tax otherwise payable under Part I of the Tax Act by an individual (other than certain 
trusts) will not be less than a minimum amount computed by reference to the individual's adjusted taxable income for the year. 
For the purposes of the Tax Act, the minimum amount generally means the amount by which 16% of adjusted taxable income in 
excess  of  $40,000,  for  the  year  exceeds  the  total  of  certain  tax  credits.    In  calculating  taxable  income  for  the  purpose  of 
determining minimum tax (called "adjusted taxable income"), certain deductions and credits otherwise available, including the 
deduction of Qualifying Expenditures from income other than resource income, are disallowed and certain amounts are included 
on a basis different from the regular tax system, such as 4/5ths of capital gains.  The Tax Act also disallows the deduction of
certain carrying charges for purposes of computing adjusted taxable income that relate to an investment in flow-through special
warrants to the extent that the deduction for such carrying charges exceeds the individual's resource income after deductions for
resource expenses, including Qualifying Expenditures.  Whether and to what extent the tax liability of a particular subscriber will
be increased by the minimum tax will depend upon the amount of such subscriber's income, the sources from which it is derived 
and the nature and amounts of any deductions that the subscriber claims.  Any additional tax payable for a year as a result of the 
application  of  the  minimum  tax  provisions  is  recoverable  in  the  seven  subsequent  years  to  the  extent  that  tax  otherwise
109
determined for those years exceeds the minimum tax.  Subscribers should consult their own independent tax advisors with respect
to any potential minimum tax consequences to them.
Cumulative Net Investment Loss
One-half of the amount of the CEE renounced to a subscriber will be added to the subscriber's cumulative net investment loss 
("CNIL")  account,  as  defined  in  the  Tax  Act.    A  subscriber's  CNIL  account  may  impact  a  subscriber's  ability  to  access  the 
$500,000 lifetime capital gains exemption available on the disposition of certain qualified small business corporation shares and 
farm property.
ELIGIBILITY FOR INVESTMENT
Provided that the Common Shares are listed on a prescribed stock exchange at the relevant time, then the Special Warrants and 
the  Common  Shares,  when  issued,  will  be  qualified  investments,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Tax  Act,  for  trusts  governed  by 
registered  retirement  savings  plans  ("RRSPs"),  registered  education  savings  plans,  registered  retirement  income  funds  and 
deferred profit sharing plans.
It would be unusual for a subscriber to subscribe for any Flow-Through Special Warrants through an RRSP as the ability to claim
the benefits of any Qualifying Expenditures could not be accessed inside the subscriber's RRSP.  An individual subscriber could
contribute all or a portion of his or her Common Shares or Special Warrants which constitute qualified investments for RRSPs 
(collectively referred to as the "Qualifying Securities") to his or her RRSP or to a spousal RRSP and thereby become entitled to a 
deduction  in  computing  income  equal  to  the  fair  market  value of  the  Qualifying Securities  at  the  time  they  are  so  contributed 
within the limits set out in the Tax Act for deductions for contributions to RRSPs.  A subscriber that contributes the Qualifying 
Securities to an RRSP will be deemed to have disposed of such Qualifying Securities for proceeds of disposition equal to the fair
market value thereof at that time.  Subscribers that contribute all or a portion of these securities to an RRSP should consult their 
own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of such a contribution having regard to their own particular circumstances.
RISK FACTORS
An investment in common shares of RedStar is speculative due to the nature of its involvement in the exploration for, and 
the acquisition, development and production of, oil and natural gas reserves.  An investor should consider carefully the 
risk factors set out below.  In addition, investors should carefully review and consider all other information contained in 
this Prospectus before making an investment decision.  There can be no assurance that RedStar's future exploration and 
development  efforts  will  result  in  the  discovery  and  development  of  additional  commercial  accumulations  of  oil  and 
natural gas.
Exploration, Development and Production Risks
Oil and natural gas operations involve many risks that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may 
not  be  able  to  overcome.    RedStar's  long-term  commercial  success  depends  on  its  ability  to  find,  acquire,  develop  and 
commercially produce oil and natural gas reserves.  Without the continual addition of new reserves, any existing reserves RedStar
may have at any particular time and the production therefrom will decline over time as such existing reserves are exploited.  A
future increase in RedStar's reserves will depend not only on its ability to explore and develop any properties RedStar may have
from time to time, but also on its ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties or prospects.  No assurance can be 
given that RedStar will be able to continue to locate satisfactory properties for acquisition or participation.  Moreover, if such 
acquisitions or participations are identified, RedStar may determine that current markets, terms of acquisition and participation or 
pricing conditions make such acquisitions or participations uneconomic.  There is no assurance that further commercial quantities
of oil and natural gas will be discovered or acquired by RedStar.
Future  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  may  involve  unprofitable  efforts,  not  only  from  dry  wells,  but  from  wells  that  are 
productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs.  Completion of a 
well  does  not  assure  a  profit  on  the  investment  or  recovery  of  drilling,  completion  and  operating  costs.    In  addition,  drilling
hazards  or  environmental  damage  could  greatly  increase  the  cost  of  operations,  and  various  field  operating  conditions  may 
adversely affect the production from successful wells.  These conditions include delays in obtaining governmental approvals or 
consents, shut-ins of connected wells resulting from extreme weather conditions, insufficient storage or transportation capacity or 
other geological and mechanical conditions.  While diligent well supervision and effective maintenance operations can contribute
110
to  maximizing  production  rates  over  time,  production  delays  and  declines  from  normal  field  operating  conditions  cannot  be 
eliminated and can be expected to adversely affect revenue and cash flow levels to varying degrees.
Oil  and  natural  gas  exploration,  development  and  production  operations  are  subject  to  all  the  risks  and  hazards  typically 
associated with such operations, including hazards such as fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, sour gas releases and spills, each
of which could result in substantial damage to oil and natural gas wells, production facilities, other property and the environment 
or in personal injury. In accordance with industry practice, RedStar will not be fully insured against all of these risks, nor are all 
such risks insurable.  Although RedStar will maintain liability insurance in an amount that it considers consistent with industry 
practice, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed policy limits, in which event RedStar could incur significant 
costs that could have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition.  Oil and natural gas production operations are also
subject  to  all  the  risks  typically  associated  with  such  operations,  including  encountering  unexpected  formations  or  pressures, 
premature decline of reservoirs and the invasion of water into producing formations. Losses resulting from the occurrence of any
of these risks could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Competition
The petroleum industry is competitive in all its phases. RedStar will compete with numerous other participants in the search for, 
and  the  acquisition  of,  oil  and  natural  gas  properties  and  in  the  marketing  of  oil  and  natural  gas.    RedStar's  competitors  will
include oil and natural gas companies that have substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than those of RedStar.
RedStar's ability to increase reserves in the future will depend not only on its ability to explore and develop its present properties, 
but also on its ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for exploratory drilling.  Competitive factors 
in the distribution and marketing of oil and natural gas include price and methods and reliability of delivery.
Regulatory
Oil and natural gas operations (exploration, production, pricing, marketing and transportation) are subject to extensive controls
and regulations imposed by various levels of government that may be amended from time to time.  See "Part VII – Other Matters 
–  Industry  Conditions".    RedStar's  operations  may  require  licenses  from  various  governmental  authorities.    There  can  be  no 
assurance that RedStar will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required to carry out exploration and
development at its projects.
Kyoto Protocol
Canada  is  a  signatory  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  and  has  ratified  the  Kyoto  Protocol 
established thereunder to set legally binding targets to reduce nationwide emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and 
other so called "greenhouse gases".  RedStar's exploration and production facilities and other operations and activities may emit a 
small  amount  of  greenhouse  gases  which  may  subject  RedStar  to  legislation  regulating  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.    The 
Government of Canada has put forward a Climate Change Plan for Canada which suggests further legislation will set greenhouse 
gases emission reduction requirements for various industrial activities, including oil and gas exploration and production.  Future 
federal legislation, together with provincial emission reduction requirements such as those proposed in Alberta's Bill 37:  Climate 
Change and Emissions Management, may require the reduction of emissions or emissions intensity produced by a corporation's 
operations and facilities.  The direct or indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect the business of RedStar.
Environmental
All phases of the oil and natural gas business present environmental risks and hazards and are subject to environmental regulation 
pursuant to a variety of federal, provincial and local laws and regulations.  Environmental legislation provides for, among other 
things, restrictions  and prohibitions on  spills,  releases or emissions  of various  substances  produced  in  association with oil  and 
natural  gas  operations.    The  legislation  also  requires  that  wells  and  facility  sites  be  operated,  maintained,  abandoned  and 
reclaimed  to  the  satisfaction  of  applicable  regulatory  authorities.    Compliance  with  such  legislation  can  require  significant 
expenditures and a breach may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, some of which may be material.  Environmental 
legislation  is  evolving  in  a  manner  expected  to  result  in  stricter  standards  and  enforcement,  larger  fines  and  liability  and 
potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs.  The discharge of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, 
soil or water may give rise to liabilities to governments and third parties and may require RedStar to incur costs to remedy such
discharge.  Although RedStar will strive to maintain material compliance with current applicable environmental regulations, no 
assurance can be given that environmental laws will not result in a curtailment of production or a material increase in the costs of
111
production, development or exploration activities or otherwise adversely affect RedStar's financial condition, results of operations 
or prospects.  See "Industry Conditions".
Prices, Markets and Marketing
The marketability and price of oil and natural gas that may be acquired or discovered by RedStar will be affected by numerous 
factors beyond its control.  RedStar's ability to market its natural gas may depend upon its ability to acquire space on pipelines 
that  deliver  natural  gas  to  commercial  markets.    RedStar  may  also  be  affected  by  deliverability  uncertainties  related  to  the 
proximity  of  its  reserves  to  pipelines  and  processing  facilities,  and  related  to  operational  problems  with  such  pipelines  and 
facilities  as  well  as  extensive  government  regulation  relating  to  price,  taxes,  royalties,  land  tenure,  allowable  production,  the 
export of oil and natural gas and many other aspects of the oil and natural gas business.
Both  oil  and  natural  gas  prices  are  unstable  and  are  subject  to  fluctuation.  Any  material  decline  in  prices  could  result  in  a 
reduction of RedStar's net production revenue.  The economics of producing from some wells may change as a result of lower 
prices,  which  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  the  volumes  of  RedStar's  reserves.    RedStar  might  also  elect  not  to  produce  from 
certain wells at lower prices.  All of these factors could result in a material decrease in RedStar's net production revenue causing a 
reduction in its oil and gas acquisition, development and exploration activities. In addition, bank borrowings available to RedStar
will  in  part  be  determined  by  RedStar's  borrowing  base.  A  sustained  material  decline  in  prices  from  historical  average  prices 
could reduce RedStar's borrowing base, therefore reducing the bank credit available to RedStar which could require that a portion, 
or all, of RedStar's bank debt be repaid.
Substantial Capital Requirements
RedStar anticipates making substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil
and natural gas reserves in the future.  If RedStar's revenues or reserves decline, it may have limited ability to expend the capital 
necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs.  There can be no assurance that  debt or equity financing or cash 
generated by operations will be available or sufficient to meet these requirements or for other corporate purposes or, if debt or
equity  financing  is  available,  that  it  will  be  on  terms  acceptable  to  it.    RedStar's  inability  to  access  sufficient  capital  for  its 
operations could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Additional Funding Requirements
The cash flow from RedStar's reserves may not be sufficient to fund its ongoing activities at all times.  From time to time, RedStar 
may require additional financing in order to carry out its oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development activities.  Failure 
to  obtain  such  financing  on  a  timely  basis  could  cause  it  to  forfeit  its  interest  in  certain  properties,  miss  certain  acquisition 
opportunities and reduce or terminate its operations.  If the revenues from RedStar's reserves decrease as a result of lower oil and 
natural gas prices or otherwise, it will affect its ability to expend the necessary capital to replace its reserves or to maintain its 
production.  If RedStar's cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no 
assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or available on terms acceptable to 
it.
Issuance of Debt
From time to time RedStar may enter into transactions to acquire assets or the shares of other corporations.  These transactions
may be financed partially or wholly with debt, which may increase its debt levels above industry standards. Depending on future
exploration and development plans, RedStar may require additional equity and/or debt financing that may not be available or, if
available, may not be available on favourable terms.  Neither RedStar's articles nor its by laws limit the amount of indebtedness 
that  RedStar  may  incur.    The  level  of  RedStar's  indebtedness  from  time  to  time,  could  impair  its  ability  to  obtain  additional 
financing in the future on a timely basis to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.
Hedging
From time to time RedStar may enter into agreements to receive fixed prices on its oil and natural gas production to offset the risk 
of revenue losses if commodity prices decline; however, if commodity prices increase beyond the levels set in such agreements, 
RedStar will not benefit from such increases.  Similarly, from time to time RedStar may enter into agreements to fix the exchange
rate of Canadian to United States dollars in order to offset the risk of revenue losses if the Canadian dollar increases in value
112
compared  to  the  United  States  dollar;  however,  if  the  Canadian  dollar  declines  in  value  compared  to  the  United  States  dollar, 
RedStar will not benefit from the fluctuating exchange rate.
Availability of Drilling Equipment and Access
Oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are dependent on the availability of drilling and related equipment in 
the particular areas where such activities will be conducted.  Demand for such limited equipment or access restrictions may affect
the availability of such equipment to RedStar and may delay exploration and development activities.  To the extent RedStar is not 
the operator of its oil and gas properties, RedStar will be dependent on such operators for the timing of activities related to such 
properties and will be largely unable to direct or control the activities of the operators.
Title to Assets
Although title reviews may be conducted prior to the purchase of oil and natural gas producing properties or the commencement 
of drilling wells, such reviews do not guarantee or certify that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise to defeat its 
claim which could result in a reduction of the revenue received by RedStar.
Reserve Estimates
There  are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating  quantities  of  oil,  natural  gas  and  NGL  reserves  and  cash  flows  to  be 
derived therefrom, including many factors beyond RedStar's control.  The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth
in this Prospectus and the Appendices hereto represents estimates only.  In general, estimates of economically recoverable oil and
natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as
historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, 
marketability of oil and gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs,
all of which may vary from actual results.  All such estimates are to some degree speculative, and classifications of reserves are 
only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved.  For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable oil and
natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and 
estimates of future net revenues expected therefrom prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times,
may vary.  RedStar's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves
will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material.
Estimates of proved reserves that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and 
upon analogy to similar types of reserves rather than actual production history.  Estimates based on these methods are generally
less reliable than those based on actual production history.  Subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production 
history and production practices will result in variations in the estimated reserves and such variations could be material.
In  accordance  with  applicable  securities  laws,  Sproule  and  Chapman  have  used  both  constant  and  escalated  price  and  cost 
estimates  in  calculating  reserve  quantities  included  in  this  Prospectus.    Actual  future  net  cash  flows  will  be  affected  by  other
factors such as actual production levels, supply and demand for oil and natural gas, curtailments or increases in consumption by
oil and natural gas purchasers, changes in governmental regulation or taxation and the impact of inflation on costs.
Actual production and cash flows derived therefrom will vary from the estimates contained in the reports prepared by Sproule and
Chapman, and such variations could be material.  The reports produced by Sproule and Chapman are based in part on the assumed 
success of activities RedStar intends to undertake in future years.  The reserves and estimated cash flows to be derived therefrom 
contained in the reports produced by Sproule and Chapman will be reduced to the extent that such activities do not achieve the 
level of success assumed in those reports.
Insurance
RedStar's involvement in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas properties may result in it becoming subject
to liability for pollution, blow outs, property damage, personal injury or other hazards.  Although prior to drilling RedStar will 
obtain insurance in accordance with industry standards to address certain of these risks, such insurance has limitations on liability 
that  may  not  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  full  extent  of  such  liabilities.    In  addition,  such  risks  may  not  in  all  circumstances  be
insurable  or,  in  certain  circumstances,  RedStar  may  elect  not  to  obtain  insurance  to  deal  with  specific  risks  due  to  the  high 
premiums  associated  with  such  insurance  or  other  reasons.  The  payment  of  such  uninsured  liabilities  would  reduce  the  funds
113
available  to  RedStar.  The  occurrence  of  a  significant  event  that  RedStar  is  not  fully  insured  against,  or  the  insolvency  of  the
insurer of such event, could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or prospects.
Dividends
To date, RedStar has not paid any dividends on the outstanding Common Shares.  Any decision to pay dividends on Common 
Shares will be made by the board of directors on the basis of its earnings, financial requirements and other conditions existing at 
such time.
Conflicts of Interest
Certain of RedStar's directors are also directors of other oil and gas companies and as such may, in certain circumstances, have a 
conflict  of  interest  requiring  them  to  abstain  from  certain  decisions.    Conflicts,  if  any,  will  be  subject  to  the  procedures  and
remedies of the ABCA.
Reliance on Key Personnel
RedStar's success depends in large measure on certain key personnel.  The loss of the services of such key personnel could have a 
material adverse affect on it.  RedStar does not have key person insurance in effect for management.  The contributions of these
individuals to its immediate operations are likely to be of central importance.  In addition, the competition for qualified personnel 
in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and there can be no assurance that RedStar will be able to continue to attract and
retain all personnel necessary for the development and operation of its business.  Investors must rely upon the ability, expertise,
judgment, discretion, integrity and good faith of RedStar's management.
INDUSTRY CONDITIONS
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive controls and regulations governing its operations (including land tenure, 
exploration, development, production, refining, transportation and marketing) imposed by legislation enacted by various levels of 
government and with respect to pricing and taxation of oil and natural gas by agreements among the governments of Canada and 
Alberta, which should be carefully considered by investors in the oil and gas industry.  It is not expected that any of these controls 
or regulations will affect RedStar's operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies 
of similar size.  All current legislation is a matter of public record and RedStar is unable to predict what additional legislation or 
amendments  may  be  enacted.    Outlined  below  are  some  of  the  principal  aspects  of  legislation,  regulations  and  agreements 
governing the oil and gas industry.
Pricing and Marketing – Oil and Natural Gas
The price of oil is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers.  Such price depends in part on oil quality, prices of
competing oils, distance to market, the value of refined products and the supply/demand balance.  Oil exporters are also entitled to 
enter into export contracts with terms not exceeding one year in the case of light crude oil and two years in the case of heavy
crude  oil,  provided  that  an  order  approving  such  export  has  been  obtained  from  the  National  Energy  Board  of  Canada  (the 
"NEB").  Any oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration (to a maximum of 25 years) requires an exporter to
obtain an export license from the NEB and the issuance of such license requires the approval of the Governor in Council.
The price of natural gas is determined by negotiation between buyers and sellers.  Natural gas exported from Canada is subject to
regulation by the NEB and the Government of Canada.  Exporters are free to negotiate prices with purchasers, provided that the 
export contracts must continue to meet certain other criteria prescribed by the NEB and the Government of Canada.  Natural gas 
exports for a term of less than 2 years or for a term of 2 to 20 years (in quantities of not more than 30,000 m3/day) must be made 
pursuant to an NEB order.  Any natural gas export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration (to a maximum of 25 
years) or a larger quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the NEB and the issuance of such license requires
the approval of the Governor in Council.
The government of Alberta also regulates the volume of natural gas that may be removed for consumption elsewhere based on 
such factors as reserve ability, transportation arrangements and market considerations.
114
The North American Free Trade Agreement
The  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  ("NAFTA")  among  the  governments  of  Canada,  United  States  of  America  and 
Mexico became effective on January 1, 1994.  NAFTA carries forward most of the material energy terms that are contained in the 
Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement. Canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports of energy resources 
to the United States or Mexico will be allowed, provided that any export restrictions do not: (i) reduce the proportion of energy 
resources exported relative to domestic use (based upon the proportion prevailing in the most recent 36 month period); (ii) impose
an export price higher than the domestic price; or (iii) disrupt normal channels of supply.  All three countries are prohibited from 
imposing minimum export or import price requirements.
NAFTA contemplates the reduction of Mexican restrictive trade practices in the energy sector and prohibits discriminatory border
restrictions and export taxes.  The agreement also contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of 
any  regulatory  changes  and  to  minimize  disruption  of  contractual  arrangements,  which  is  important  for  Canadian  natural  gas 
exports.
Provincial Royalties and Incentives
In addition to federal regulation, each province has legislation and regulations that govern land tenure, royalties, production rates, 
environmental protection and other matters.  The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of crude oil, natural gas 
liquids, sulphur and natural gas production.  Royalties payable on production from lands other than Crown lands are determined 
by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee, although production from such lands is subject to certain provincial 
taxes and royalties. Crown royalties are determined by governmental regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of 
the value of the gross production.  The rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices, well
productivity, geographical location, field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced.
From  time  to  time  the  governments  of  the  western  Canadian  provinces  create  incentive  programs  for  exploration  and 
development.    Such  programs  often  provide  for  royalty  rate  reductions,  royalty  holidays  and  tax  credits,  and  are  generally 
introduced when commodity prices are low.  The programs are designed to encourage exploration and development activity by 
improving earnings and cash flow within the industry.
Regulations made pursuant to the Mines and Minerals Act (Alberta) provide various incentives for exploring and developing oil 
reserves in Alberta.  Oil produced from horizontal extensions commenced at least 5 years after the well was originally spudded 
may also qualify for a royalty reduction.  A 24 month, 8,000 m3 exemption is available to production from a well that has not 
produced for a 12 month period, if resuming production after February 1, 1993.  As well, oil production from eligible new field
and new pool wildcat wells and deeper pool test wells spudded or deepened after September 30, 1992 is entitled to a 12 month 
royalty exemption (to a maximum of $1 million).  Oil produced from low productivity wells, enhanced recovery schemes (such as 
injection wells) and experimental projects is also subject to royalty reductions.
The Alberta government has also introduced a Third Tier Royalty with a base rate of 10% and a rate cap of 25% for oil pools 
discovered after September 30, 1992.  The new oil royalty reserved to the Crown has a base rate of 10% and a rate cap of 30%.  
The old oil royalty reserved to the Crown has a base rate of 10% and a rate cap of 35%.
In Alberta, the royalty reserved to the Crown in respect of natural gas production, subject to various incentives, is between 15%
and 30%, in the case of new gas, and between 15% and 35%, in the case of old gas, depending upon a prescribed reference or 
corporate average price.  Natural gas produced from qualifying exploratory gas wells spudded or deepened after July 31, 1985 and
before June 1, 1988 is eligible for a royalty exemption for a period of 12 months, up to a prescribed maximum amount.  Natural 
gas produced from qualifying intervals in eligible gas wells spudded or deepened to a depth below 2,500 meters is also subject to
a royalty exemption, the amount of which depends on the depth of the well.
In Alberta, a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the royalties payable to the Crown by virtue of the ARTC 
program.  The ARTC rate is based on a price sensitive formula and the ARTC rate varies between 75% at prices at and below 
$100 per m3 and 25% at prices at and above $210 per m3.  The ARTC rate is applied to a maximum of $2,000,000 of Alberta 
Crown  royalties  payable  for  each  producer  or  associated  group  of  producers.    Crown  royalties  on  production  from  producing 
properties acquired from a corporation claiming maximum entitlement to ARTC will generally not be eligible for ARTC.  The 
rate will be established quarterly based on the average "par price", as determined by the Alberta Department of Energy for the

On  December  22,  1997,  the  Alberta  government  announced  that  it  was  conducting  a  review  of  the  ARTC  program  with  the 
objective of setting out better targeted objectives for a smaller program and to deal with administrative difficulties.  On August
30, 1999, the Alberta government announced that it would not be reducing the size of the program but that it would introduce new
rules to reduce the number of persons who qualify for the program.  The new rules preclude companies that pay less than $10,000
in royalties per year and non-corporate entities from qualifying for the program.  Such rules do not presently preclude RedStar
from being eligible for the ARTC program.
In November 2003,  the Tax Act  was  amended  to  provide  the  following  initiatives  applicable  to  the oil  and gas  industry  to  be 
phased  in  over  a  five  year  period:  (i)  a  reduction  of  the  federal  statutory  corporate  income  tax  rate  on  income  earned  from 
resource  activities  from  28  to  21%,  beginning  with  a  one  percentage  point  reduction  effective  January  1,  2003,  and  (ii)  a 
deduction  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  of  actual  provincial  and  other  Crown  royalties  and  mining  taxes  paid  and  the 
elimination  of  the  25%  resource  allowance.    In  addition,  the  percentage  of  ARTC  that  RedStar  will  be  required  to  include  in 
federal taxable income will be 5% in 2003; 12.5% in 2004; 17.5% in 2005; 32.5% in 2006; 50% in 2007; 60% in 2008; 70% in 
2009; 80% in 2010; 90% in 2011, and 100% in 2012 and beyond.
Land Tenure
Crude  oil  and  natural  gas  located  in  the  western  provinces  is  owned  predominantly  by  the  respective  provincial  governments. 
Provincial governments grant rights to explore for and produce oil and natural gas pursuant to leases, licenses and permits for
varying terms from two years and on conditions set forth in provincial legislation including requirements to perform specific work 
or  make  payments.    Oil  and  natural  gas  located  in  such  provinces  can  also  be  privately  owned  and  rights  to  explore  for  and 
produce such oil and natural gas are granted by lease on such terms and conditions as may be negotiated.
Environmental Regulation
The oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulations pursuant to a variety of provincial and federal 
legislation.  Such legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on the release or emission of various substances produced 
in association with certain oil and gas industry operations.  In addition, such legislation requires that well and facility sites be 
abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities.  Compliance with such legislation can require significant
expenditures and a breach of such requirements may result in suspension or revocation of necessary licenses and authorizations,
civil liability for pollution damage and the imposition of material fines and penalties.
Environmental legislation in Alberta has been consolidated into the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (the 
"APEA"),  which  came  into  force  on  September  1,  1993.    The  APEA  imposes  stricter  environmental  standards,  requires  more 
stringent  compliance,  reporting  and  monitoring  obligations  and  significantly  increases  penalties.    RedStar  anticipates  making 
increased  expenditures  of  both  a  capital  and  an  expense  nature  as  a  result  of  the  increasingly  stringent  laws  relating  to  the 
protection  of  the  environment  and  will  be  taking  such  steps  as  required  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  APEA  and  similar 
legislation in other jurisdictions in which RedStar operates.  RedStar believes that it is in material  compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations.  RedStar also believes that it is reasonably likely that the trend towards stricter standards in 
environmental legislation and regulation will continue.

STATUTORY RIGHTS OF WITHDRAWAL AND RESCISSION
Securities legislation in certain of the provinces of Canada provides purchasers with the right to withdraw from an agreement to
purchase securities.  This right may be exercised within two business days after receipt or deemed receipt of a prospectus and any
amendment.    In  several  of  the  provinces,  securities  legislation further  provides  a  purchaser with  remedies  for  rescission  or,  in
some  jurisdictions,  damages  if  the  prospectus  and  any  amendment  contains  a  misrepresentation  or  is  not  delivered  to  the 
purchaser, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by 
the securities legislation of the purchaser's province of residence.  The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the 
securities  legislation  of  the  province  in  which  the  purchaser  resides  for  the  particulars  of  these  rights  or  consult  with  a  legal
advisor.
CONTRACTUAL RIGHT OF ACTION FOR RESCISSION
In  the  event  that  a  holder  of  a  Special  Warrant,  who  acquires  a  Common  Share  upon  the  exercise  of  the  Special  Warrant  as 
provided for in this Prospectus, is or becomes entitled under applicable securities legislation to the remedy of rescission by reason 
of this Prospectus or any amendment thereto containing a misrepresentation, such holder shall be entitled to rescission not only of 
the holder's exercise of its Special Warrant(s) but also of the private placement transaction pursuant to which the Special Warrant 
was  initially  acquired,  and  shall  be  entitled  in  connection  with such  rescission  to  a  full  refund of  all  consideration  paid  to  the 
Underwriter  on  the  acquisition  of  the  Special  Warrant.    In  the  event  such  holder  is  a  permitted  assignee  of  the  interest  of  the
original  Special  Warrant  subscriber,  such  permitted  assignee  shall  be  entitled  to  exercise  the  rights  of  recession  and  refund 
granted hereunder as if such permitted assignee was such original subscriber.  The foregoing is in addition to any other right or 
remedy available to a holder of the Special Warrant under section 130 of the Securities Act (Ontario) or otherwise at law.

RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. 
(Formerly Pelorus Energy Corp.) 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited)
September 30, 2005 and May 31, 2005
1.  Nature of Operations and Organization
Pelorus Energy Corp. (“Pelorus”) was incorporated under the laws of the Business Corporations Act 
(Alberta). Until February of 2003, Pelorus was a global provider of products and services related to 
aircraft landings.  Following a suspension of business activities and a transfer from the TSX Venture 
Exchange to the NEX board of the TSX Venture, the Company has undergone several changes.  The 
Company was re-activated and re-listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, changed its name to Pelorus 
Energy  Corp.  and  changed  operations  into  an  oil  and  gas  company  by  way  of  initiatives  that  were 
approved by the shareholders in September 2004.
On July 13, 2005 the Company’s shareholders approved an amalgamation with a private company 
named RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. (“Private Co.”) which occurred on August 1, 2005, and then changed 
its name to RedStar Oil and Gas Inc. (“RedStar” or “the Company”). Pursuant to the amalgamation 
agreement, the Company reorganized its share capital whereby the issued and issuable shares were 
consolidated at a twenty five shares for one basis. The number of common shares, common share 
options and warrants outstanding, common share prices and per share calculations for both current 
and prior periods have been restated to reflect this consolidation. 
The Company changed its year end to December 31st from May 31st in order for its financial results to 
be easily comparable with its peer group. Due to the Company’s previous year end not being on a 
standard quarter and the result of the change in year ends the Company is required to present the 
four month operating results for the period ending September 30, 2005 compared to the three month 
results for the comparative period ending on August 31, 2004.
2.  Basis of Presentation
The  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  by 
management, 
in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The 
preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts 
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.    The  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have,  in  management’s  opinion,  been 
properly  prepared  using  careful  judgement  with  reasonable  limits  of  materiality.    These  interim 
consolidated financial statements do not include all the note disclosures required for annual financial 
statements  and  therefore  they  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s  audited  financial 
statements  for  the  year  ended  May  31,  2005.    The  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have 
been  prepared  following  the  same  significant  accounting  policies  as  the  most  recently  reported 
annual financial statements of Pelorus.
3.  Business Acquisitions
In  November  2004,  through  two  separate  transactions  with  arms-length  parties,  the  Company 
purchased  petroleum  and  natural  gas  assets  for  total  consideration  of  $1,121,900,  before  final 
adjustments.  These transactions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. 
The first transaction was paid for by the issuance of 674,600 common shares of the Company valued 
at $1,011,900.  The second transaction was paid by cash in the amount of $110,000, less purchase 
price  adjustments  of  $4,513  (net  $105,487),  which  was  funded  by  an  equity  offering  completed  on 
October 29, 2004. In conjunction with these purchases, an asset retirement obligation in the amount 
of  $25,200  has  been  recorded  to  recognize  the  future  asset  retirement  obligations  associated  with 
these purchases.

3.  Business Acquisitions - continued
RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. 
(Formerly Pelorus Energy Corp.) 
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (unaudited)
On  June  30,  2005,  the  Company  acquired  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of 
Bowfort  Oil  &  Gas  Ltd.  (“Bowfort”)  a  private  company.  The  acquisition  was  a  non-arms  length 
acquisition as Bowfort was controlled by a Director of the Company and was accounted for using the 
purchase method with the results of operations included from June 30, 2005. As a substantial change 
in  ownership  occurred  the  purchase  price  was  allocated  using  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  and 
liabilities of Bowfort as follows:
Cash acquired
Purchase consideration: 
 - 1,142,857 Common shares issued
$    2,000,000
$     2,000,000
On  August  1,  2005,  Pelorus  amalgamated  with  RedStar  Oil  &  Gas  Inc.  (“Private  Co.”)  a  private 
company  as  disclosed  in  Note  1.  As  Pelorus  shareholders  held  the  majority  of  the  shares  in  the 
amalgamated  company,  Pelorus  was  considered  to  be  the  acquirer  for  accounting  purposes. 
Accordingly,  the  transaction  was  accounted  for  using  the  purchase  method  with  the  results  of 
operations for Private Co. included from August 1, 2005. The purchase price was allocated based on 
the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Private Co. as follows:
Cash acquired 
Working capital deficiency 
Working capital surplus 
Property and equipment 
Asset retirement obligation 
Future tax liability 
Net assets acquired
Purchase consideration: 
 - 8,194,122 Common shares issued

The  undiscounted  amount  of  cash  flows,  required  over  the  estimated  reserve  life  of  the  underlying 
assets,  to  settle  the  obligation,  adjusted  for  inflation,  is  estimated  at  $273,000.  The  obligation  was 
calculated  using  a  credit-adjusted  risk  free  discount  rate  of  8  percent  and  an  inflation  rate  of  2 
percent. It is expected that this obligation will be funded from general Company resources at the time 
the costs are incurred with the majority of costs expected to occur between 2010 and 2024.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Redstar  Oil  &  Gas  Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “Redstar”)  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  Business 
Corporations  Act  (Alberta)  on  September  22,  2004.  The  Company’s  primary  business  is  the  acquisition, 
exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas in Western Canada.
On July 13, 2005 the Company approved an amalgamation with a public company named Pelorus Energy Corp. 
(see note 13), which occurred on July 31, 2005, and the newly amalgamated company continues as RedStar Oil 
and Gas Inc.
2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by management in accordance with 
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions 
that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual 
results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  have,  in  management’s 
opinion,  been  properly  prepared  within  reasonable  limits  of  materiality  and  within  the  framework  of  the 
significant accounting policies summarized below:
Measurement uncertainty
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.  
Management  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses 
during the reporting year.  Actual results can differ from those estimates.
Recorded  amounts  for  depletion,  depreciation,  and  accretion  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  and 
equipment and asset retirement obligations are based on estimates. The ceiling test and impairment calculations 
are based on estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, future costs required to develop those reserves and the 
fair value of unproved properties.  By their nature, these estimates of reserves and the related future cash flows 
are  subject  to  measurement  uncertainty,  and  the  effect  on  the  financial  statements  of  future  years  could  be 
significant.
The  value  of  the  asset  retirement  obligation  depends  on  estimates  of  current  market  interest  rates  and  future 
restoration  and  reclamation  expenditures.  By  their  nature,  these  estimates  are  subject  to  measurement 
uncertainty  and  the  effect  on  the  financial  statements  of  changes  of  estimates  in  future  periods  could  be 
significant.
The capital expenditures classification made with respect to the renouncement of flow-through shares is based 
on estimates from geological information obtained and the classification of the expenditures may be challenged 
by the taxation authorities and in this regard the assessments may be different from that of management.  By 
their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of 
changes of estimates in future periods could be significant.
Property and equipment
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for petroleum and natural gas operations, whereby all 
costs of acquiring, exploring for and developing petroleum and natural gas properties and related reserves are 
capitalized into a single Canadian cost centre.  Such costs include land acquisition costs, costs of drilling both 
productive  and  non-productive  wells,  geological  and  geophysical  expenditures,  well  equipment  and  certain 
other overhead expenditures related to exploration.

as at and for the period from inception on September 22, 2004 to December 31, 2004
2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Property and equipment
Capitalized  costs,  including  tangible  well  equipment  (net  of  salvage  value)  and  estimated  costs  of  future 
development  of  proven  undeveloped  reserves,  are  depleted  using  the  unit-of-production  method  based  on 
estimated gross proven reserves (before royalties) of petroleum and natural gas as determined by independent 
reserve  engineers.  The  Company  uses  a  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  (“boe”)  unit  of  production  in  its  depletion 
calculation  where  natural  gas  is  converted  to  a  boe  basis using the ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (“mcf”) of 
natural gas equal to 1 boe.
Gains  or  losses  on  the  sale  or  disposition  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  are  not  recognized  except 
under circumstances, which result in a revision of the depletion rate by 20% or more.
Depreciation of office furniture and equipment is computed using an annual rate of 20%.
The  Company  tests  its  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  for  impairment  using  undiscounted  future  net 
revenue from proven reserves based on expected future product prices and costs. Impairment of petroleum and 
natural gas properties is recognized when their carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted future net cash 
flows, at which time the assets are written down to fair value of the proved and probable reserves plus the cost 
of unproved properties, net of impairment allowances. Fair value is determined using the net present value of 
future  cash  flows  from  proved  plus  probable  reserves  based  on  third  party  quoted  future  prices  adjusted  for 
transportation and quality and estimated future costs. The Company’s risk-free interest rate is used to arrive at 
the net present value of the future cash flows.
Joint operations
Certain of the Company’s exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with others 
and accordingly, the financial statements reflect only the Company’s proportionate interest in such activities.
Asset retirement obligations
The Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it 
is incurred or when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made, and records a corresponding increase in 
the carrying value of the related long-lived asset.  The fair value is determined through a review of engineering 
studies, industry guidelines, and management’s estimate on a site-by-site basis.  The liability is subsequently 
adjusted for the passage of time, which is recognized as an accretion expense in the statement of net income 
(loss). The liability is also adjusted due to revisions in either the timing or the amount of the original estimated 
cash flows associated with the liability.  The increase in the carrying value of the asset is amortized using the 
unit of production method based on estimated gross proven reserves, as determined by independent engineers. 
Actual costs incurred upon settlement of the asset retirement obligations are charged against the asset retirement 
obligation  to  the  extent  of  the  liability  recorded.    Any  difference  between  the  actual  costs  incurred  upon 
settlement  of  the  asset  retirement  obligation  and  the  recorded  liability  is  recognized  as  a  gain  or  loss  in  the 
Company’s earnings or loss in the period in which the settlement occurs.
Cash
Cash includes investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Income taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, future income 
tax assets and liabilities are measured based upon temporary differences between the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities and their tax basis.  Income tax expense (recovery) is computed based on the change during the 
period in the future tax assets and liabilities.  Effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when 
substantively enacted. A valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that the realization of future tax assets is 
not more likely than not.
Flow-through shares
The Company has financed a portion of its exploration and development activities through the issue of flow-
through  shares.    Under  the  terms  of  the  flow-through  share  agreements,  the  tax  attributes  of  the  related 
expenditures  are  renounced  to  the  subscribers.    Share  capital  is  reduced  and  future  income  tax  liability  is 
increased  by  the  tax  effected  amount  of  the  renounced  tax  deductions  at  the  time  of  renouncement  which  is 
when  the  related  documentation  is  filed  with  the  appropriate  government  agency  and  there  is  reasonable 
certainty that the expenditures will be incurred.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of oil, gas and liquids is recognized based on volume delivered at contractual delivery 
points  and  rates.    The  costs  associated  with  the  delivery,  including  operating,  transportation  and  production-
based royalty expenses, are recognized in the same year in which the related revenue is earned and recorded. 
Transportation costs are recorded separately as part of the operating costs.
Stock-based compensation
The  Company  accounts  for  stock  options  granted  to  employees  and  directors  using  the  fair  value  method  of 
accounting.  Under this method, stock-based compensation is recorded as an expense over the expected life of 
the option, with a corresponding increase recorded as contributed surplus.  Stock-based compensation expense 
is based on the estimated fair value of the related stock option at the time of the grant using a Black-Scholes 
option  model.    When  stock  options  are  exercised,  related  amounts  previously  accumulated  as  contributed 
surplus are credited to share capital. At June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Company had a stock option 
plan but had not issued any stock options.
Per share amounts
Per  share  amounts  are  calculated  using  the  total  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding 
during  the  period.    Diluted  per  share  calculations  reflect  the  exercise  or  conversion  of  potentially  dilutive 
securities  at  the  later  of  the  date  of  grant  of  such  securities  or  the  beginning  of  the  period.    The  Company 
computes diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock 
options. Under this method, the diluted weighted average number of shares is calculated assuming the proceeds 
that arise from the exercise of outstanding, in the money options are used to purchase common shares of the 
Company at their average market price for the period.
Financial instruments
The  Company  carries  a  number  of  financial  instruments  as detailed  on the balance sheet. It is management's 
opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest,  currency  or  credit  risks  arising  from  these 
financial instruments.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Hedging
The Company may enter into financial instruments to hedge against adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates, electricity rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Payments or receipts on financial instruments that 
are designated and effective as hedges are recognized in income concurrently with the hedged transaction.  If 
the hedge of an anticipated future transaction is terminated or if a hedge ceases to be effective, the gain or loss 
at that date is deferred and recognized concurrently with the anticipated transaction.  Subsequent changes in the 
value of the financial instrument are reflected in income.  Any financial instrument that does not constitute a 
hedge  is  recorded  at  fair  value  with  any  resulting  gain  or  loss  reflected  in  income.  At  June  30,  2005  and 
December 31, 2004, the Company had not entered into any hedging transactions.
3.
BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
The consolidated balance sheet reflects the business combination with Avenir Resources (2003) Ltd. (“Avenir”) 
a private company, whereby all of the issued and outstanding shares of Avenir were acquired by RedStar for 
consideration of 11,971,429 common shares at a price of $0.07 per share on June 30, 2005.  The value of $0.07 
per share was based on the issue price of Redstar’s common shares in the most recent private placement that 
closed in March 2005. The acquisition was a non-arms length transaction and has been accounted for using the 
purchase  method  with  the  purchase  price  being  allocated  using  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of 
Avenir as a substantive change in ownership occurred. The fair value of the assets and liabilities of Avenir have 
been allocated as follows:
Cash acquired 
Accounts receivable 
Accounts payable 
Working capital surplus 
Property and equipment 
Asset retirement obligation 
Future tax asset

As at June 30, 2005, costs of acquiring unproved properties and seismic in the amount of $9,623,094 (December 
2004 - $2,915) were excluded from depletable costs.
During  the  period  the  Company  acquired  non-producing  oil  and  gas  properties  in  two  separate  arms  length 
transactions  in  exchange  for  11,914,285  and  15,300,000  common  shares  respectively  at  a  value  of  $0.07  per 
share (Note 7).
An impairment test calculation was performed on the Company’s property and equipment at June 30, 2005 and it 
was  determined  that  the  fair  market  value  exceeded  the  carrying  amount  of  the  Company’s  property  and 
equipment.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (Continued)
The  undiscounted  amount  of  cash  flows,  required  over  the  estimated  reserve  life  of  the  underlying  assets,  to 
settle  the  obligation,  adjusted  for  inflation,  is  estimated  at  approximately  $169,000.  The  obligation  was 
calculated  using  a  credit-adjusted  risk  free  discount  rate  of  8  percent  and  an  inflation  rate  of  2  percent.  It  is 
expected that this obligation will be funded from general Company resources at the time the costs are incurred 
with the majority of costs expected to occur by 2015.

subscription  receivables  have  subsequently  been  collected  and  all  amounts  previously  held  in  trust  with  the 
Company’s lawyers have been released to the Company.
The  Company  has  issued  81,000,000  common  share  purchase  warrants.  Each  purchase  warrant  entitles  the 
holder to purchase one common share at a price of $0.10 until December 31, 2009. No value was originally 
assigned  to  the  warrants.  As  at  June  30,  2005  all  purchase  warrants  are  still  outstanding.  These  purchase 
warrants  have  not  been  included  in  the  calculation  of  per  share  numbers.  The  Company  has  no  other 
outstanding convertible or non-convertible securities. The Company has reserved 81,000,000 common shares 
for the issuance upon the exercise of the warrants.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
As  disclosed  in  Note  2,  the  Company  holds  various  forms  of  financial  instruments.  The  nature  of  these 
instruments  and  the  Company’s  operations  expose  the  Company  to  commodity  price  and  credit  risks.  The 
Company manages its exposure to these risks by operating in a manner that minimizes its exposure to the extent

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)
(b) Credit risk
A significant portion of the Company’s cash is currently held with the same financial institution and, as 
such,  the  Company  is  exposed  to  concentration  of  credit  risk.  Substantially  all  the  Company’s  accounts 
receivable  are  with  customers  and  joint  venture  partners  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  and  are  subject  to 
normal industry credit risks.
(c) Fair value risk
The Company’s cash, accounts receivable, amount due to related parties and accounts payable constitute its 
financial  instruments.  Except  for  the  amount  due  to  related  parties,  the  fair  value  of  these  financial 
instruments approximate their carrying value. The fair value of the amounts due to related parties has not 
been disclosed as it is not practicable to determine fair value with sufficient reliability as the Company is 
privately owned.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Pursuant to flow-through financings completed in the year the Company is committed to spending $5.6 million 
on  qualified  exploration  and  development  expenditures  by  December  31,  2005.  As  at  June  30,  2005  the 
Company has expended all the qualified expenditures related to the financing.
The  operations  of  the  Company  are  complex,  and  related  tax  interpretations,  regulations  and  legislation 
affecting the Company are continually changing.  As a result, periodically, there may be some unusual matters 
under review. Although the ultimate impact of these matters on net earnings cannot be determined at this time, 
it could be material for any one quarter or year.
12.
INDEMNIFICATIONS
From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or has claims sought against it in the normal course of 
business operations.  Management of the Company is not currently aware of any claims or actions that would 
materially affect the Company’s reported financial position or results from operations.
Under the terms of certain agreements and the Company's by-laws the Company indemnifies individuals who 
have acted at the Company's request to be a director and/or officer of the Company, to the extent permitted by 
law,  against  any  and  all  damages,  liabilities,  costs,  charges  or  expenses  suffered  by  or  incurred  by  the 
individuals as a result of their service. The Company has no outstanding claims having a potentially material 
adverse effect on the Company as a whole.

1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
1
Avenir  Resources  (2003)  Ltd.  (the  “Company”)  was  formed  effective  December  12,  2003.  The  Company’s 
business  is  the  acquisition,  exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas in Western 
Canada.
Prior to mid 2004 the Company had no operating activity.  Accordingly, comparative statements of loss and 
deficit  and  cash  flows  for  the  six-month  period  ended  June  30,  2004  and  for  the  period  from  inception  on 
December 12, 2003 to December 31, 2003 have not been presented.
2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  financial  statements  of  the  Company  have  been  prepared  by  management  in  accordance  with  Canadian 
generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian 
generally  accepted  accounting  principles requires  management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the  amounts  reported  in  these  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ  from 
those  estimates.  These  financial  statements  have,  in  management’s  opinion,  been  properly  prepared  using 
careful judgement with reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting 
policies summarized below:
Measurement uncertainty
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.  
Management  makes  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses 
during the reporting year.  Actual results can differ from those estimates.
Recorded  amounts  for  depletion,  depreciation,  and  accretion  of  oil  and  natural  gas  properties and equipment 
and asset retirement obligations are based on estimates. The ceiling test and impairment calculations are based 
on estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, future costs required to develop those reserves and the fair value of 
unproved properties.  By their nature, these estimates of reserves and the related future cash flows are subject to 
measurement uncertainty, and the effect on the financial statements of future years could be significant.
The capital expenditures classification made with respect to the renouncement of flow-through shares is based 
on estimates from geological information obtained and the classification of the expenditures may be challenged 
by the taxation authorities and in this regard the assessments may be different from that of management.  By 
their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of 
changes of estimates in future periods could be significant.
Property and equipment
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for petroleum and natural gas operations, whereby all 
costs of acquiring, exploring for and developing petroleum and natural gas properties and related reserves are 
capitalized into a single Canadian cost centre.  Such costs include land acquisition costs, costs of drilling both 
productive  and  non-productive  wells,  geological  and  geophysical  expenditures,  well  equipment  and  certain 
other overhead expenditures related to exploration.
Capitalized  costs,  including  tangible  well  equipment  (net  of  salvage  value)  and  estimated  costs  of  future 
development  of  proven  undeveloped  reserves,  are  depleted  using  the  unit-of-production  method  based  on 
estimated gross proven reserves (before royalties) of petroleum and natural gas as determined by independent 
reserve  engineers.  The  Company  uses  a  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  (“boe”)  unit  of  production  in  its  depletion 
calculation  where  natural  gas  is  converted  to  a  boe  basis using the ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (“mcf”) of 
natural gas equal to 1 boe.

Notes to the Financial Statements
As at and for the six month period ended June 30, 2005 (unaudited) 
and as at and for the year ended December 31, 2004 and as at and for  
the initial period ended December 31, 2003 (audited)
2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Property and equipment
2
Gains  or  losses  on  the  sale  or  disposition  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  are  not  recognized  except 
under circumstances, which result in a revision of the depletion rate by 20% or more.
Depreciation of office furniture and equipment is computed using an annual rate of 20%.
The  Company  tests  its  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  for  impairment  using  undiscounted  future  net 
revenue from proven reserves based on expected future product prices and costs. Impairment of petroleum and 
natural  gas  properties  is  recognized  when  their  carrying  amount  is  greater  than  the  undiscounted  future  net 
reserves, at which time the assets are written down to fair value of the proved and probable reserves plus the 
cost of unproved properties, net of impairment allowances. Fair value is determined using the net present value 
of future cash flows from proved plus probable reserves based on third party quoted future prices adjusted for 
transportation and quality and estimated future costs. A risk-free interest rate is used to arrive at the net present 
value of the future cash flows.
Joint operations
Certain of the Company’s exploration, development and production activities are conducted jointly with others 
and accordingly, the financial statements reflect only the Company’s proportionate interest in such activities.
Asset retirement obligations
The Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it 
is incurred or when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made, and records a corresponding increase in 
the carrying value of the related long-lived asset.  The fair value is determined through a review of engineering 
studies, industry guidelines, and management’s estimate on a site-by-site basis.  The liability is subsequently 
adjusted  for  the  passage  of  time,  which  is  recognized  as  an  accretion  expense  in  the  statement  of operations 
under  asset  retirement  obligations.  The  liability  is  also  adjusted  due  to  revisions  in  either  the  timing  or  the 
amount of the original estimated cash flows associated with the liability.  The increase in the carrying value of 
the  asset  is  amortized  using  the  unit  of  production  method  based  on  estimated  gross  proven  reserves,  as 
determined by independent engineers. Actual costs incurred upon settlement of the asset retirement obligations 
are  charged  against  the  asset  retirement  obligation  to  the  extent  of  the  liability  recorded.    Any  difference 
between the actual costs incurred upon settlement of the asset retirement obligation and the recorded liability is 
recognized as a gain or loss in the Company’s earnings or loss in the period in which the settlement occurs.
Income taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, future income 
tax assets and liabilities are measured based upon temporary differences between the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities and their tax basis.  Income tax expense (recovery) is computed based on the change during the 
year in the future tax assets and liabilities.  Effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when 
substantively enacted. A valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that the realization of future tax assets is 
not more likely than not.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Flow-through shares
3
The Company has financed a portion of its exploration and development activities through the issue of flow-
through  shares.  Under  the  terms  of  the  flow-through  share  agreements,  the  tax  attributes  of  the  related 
expenditures  are  renounced  to  the  subscribers.    Share  capital  is  reduced  and  future  income  tax  liability  is 
increased by the tax effected amount of the renounced tax deductions at the time of renouncement and there is 
reasonable certainty that the expenditures will be incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of oil, gas and liquids is recognized based on volume delivered at contractual delivery 
points  and  rates.    The  costs  associated  with  the  delivery,  including  operating,  transportation  and  production-
based royalty expenses, are recognized in the same year in which the related revenue is earned and recorded. 
Transportation costs are recorded separately as part of the operating costs.
Per share amounts
Per  share  amounts  are  calculated  using  the  total  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding 
during  the  period.    Diluted  per  share  calculations  reflect  the  exercise  or  conversion  of  potentially  dilutive 
securities  at  the  later  of  the  date  of  grant  of  such  securities  or  the  beginning  of  the  period.    The  Company 
computes diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock 
options. Under this method, the diluted weighted average number of shares is calculated assuming the proceeds 
that arise from the exercise of outstanding, in the money options are used to purchase common shares of the 
Company at their average market price for the period.
Financial instruments
The  Company  carries  a  number  of  financial  instruments  as detailed  on the balance sheet. It is management's 
opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest,  currency  or  credit  risks  arising  from  these 
financial instruments. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values, unless 
otherwise noted.
Hedging
The Company may enter into financial instruments to hedge against adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange 
rates, electricity rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Payments or receipts on financial instruments that 
are designated and effective as hedges are recognized in income concurrently with the hedged transaction.  If 
the hedge of an anticipated future transaction is terminated or if a hedge ceases to be effective, the gain or loss 
at that date is deferred and recognized concurrently with the anticipated transaction.  Subsequent changes in the 
value of the financial instrument are reflected in income.  Any financial instrument that does not constitute a 
hedge  is  recorded  at  fair  value  with  any  resulting  gain  or  loss  reflected  in  income.  As  at  June  30,  2005  and 
December 31, 2004 the Company had not entered into any hedging transactions.

The  undiscounted  amount  of  cash flows, required over the estimated reserve life of the underlying assets, to 
settle  the  obligation,  adjusted  for  inflation,  is  estimated  at  approximately  $27,000.  The  obligation  was 
calculated  using  a  credit-adjusted  risk free  discount  rate  of  8  percent  and  an  inflation  rate  of  2  percent.  It  is 
expected that this obligation will be funded from general Company resources at the time the costs are incurred 
with the majority of costs expected to occur by 2020.

by this offering were renounced under the look-back rule in 2004 when the expenditures were incurred. A future 
tax liability was recorded when the expenditures were renounced. The shares were issued to directors and officers 
of the Company.
On  March  31,  2005,  the  Company  issued  366,667  common  shares  at  $0.90  per  share  to  a  related  party  as 
consideration for settlement of a promissory note (Note 9(a)). As the transaction was a non-cash transaction it has 
been excluded from the statement of cash flows.
On June 29, 2005, the Company committed to issue 444,444 common shares to a company controlled by directors 
and officers pursuant to the acquisition agreement with RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. (Note 12). The funds from this 
transaction were received subsequent to period end.

Future income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. The components of the 
Company's future income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
Non-capital loss carry forwards 
Property and equipment

Subject  to  confirmation  by  the  income  tax  authorities,  the  Company  has  non-capital  losses  of  approximately 
$21,000 (2004 - $Nil), which are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. If unutilized, these losses 
will expire in 2014.
7.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
As  disclosed  in  Note  2,  the  Company  holds  various  forms  of  financial  instruments.  The  nature  of  these 
instruments  and  the  Company’s  operations  expose  the  Company  to  commodity  price  and  credit  risks.  The 
Company manages its exposure to these risks by operating in a manner that minimizes its exposure to the extent 
practical.
(a)  Commodity price risk
The Company will be subject to commodity price risk for the delivery of natural gas and crude oil.
(b)  Credit risk
A significant portion of the Company’s cash is currently held with the same financial institution and, as 
such,  the  Company  is  exposed  to  concentration  of  credit  risk.  Substantially  all  the  Company’s  accounts 
receivable  are  with  customers  and  joint  venture  partners  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  and  are  subject  to 
normal industry credit risks.
(c)  Fair value risk
The  fair  value  of  the  amounts  due  to  related  parties  has  not  been  disclosed  as  it  is  not  practicable  to 
determine fair value with sufficient reliability as the Company is privately owned.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
7
Except as disclosed elsewhere the Company had the following related party transactions:
(a)  During  2005,  $330,000  in  promissory notes held by a related party were settled through the issuance of 
366,667 common shares of the Company at a value of $0.90 per share and the price was based on  recent 
share issuances.
(b)  At June 30, 2005, the Company had $nil (December 31, 2004 - $403,849 and December 31, 2003 - $nil) 
due to a director of the Company or to companies controlled by directors of the Company in connection 
with a non-interest bearing loan made to the Company.
All  related  party  transactions  disclosed  throughout  the  notes  to  these  financial  statements  are  in  the  normal 
course  of  operations  and  have  been  measured  at  the  agreed  to  exchange  amounts,  which  is  the  amount  of 
consideration established and agreed to by the related parties and which is similar to those negotiated with third 
parties.
10.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The  operations  of  the  Company  are  complex,  and  related  tax  interpretations,  regulations  and  legislation 
affecting the Company are continually changing.  As a result, periodically, there may be some unusual matters 
under review. Although the ultimate impact of these matters on net earnings cannot be determined at this time, 
it could be material for any one quarter or year.
11.
INDEMNIFICATIONS
From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or has claims sought against it in the normal course of 
business operations.  Management of the Company is not currently aware of any claims or actions that would 
materially affect the Company’s reported financial position or results from operations.
Under the terms of certain agreements and the Company's by-laws the Company indemnifies individuals who 
have acted at the Company's request to be a director and/or officer of the Company, to the extent permitted by 
law,  against  any  and  all  damages,  liabilities,  costs,  charges  or  expenses  suffered  by  or  incurred  by  the 
individuals as a result of their service. The Company has no outstanding claims having a potentially material 
adverse effect on the Company as a whole.
12.
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On May 15, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement whereby all of the issued and outstanding share of 
the Company would be purchased by RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. (“RedStar”), a private company, in exchange for 
11,971,429 (pre-consolidation) shares of RedStar. The transaction closed on June 30, 2005.

l. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND ORGANIZATION
Pelorus Navigation Systems Inc. (“Pelorus” or “the Company") was incorporated under the laws of the Business
: Corporations Act (Alberta). Until February of 2003, Pelorus was a global provider of products and services
related to aircraﬁ landings. Following a suspension of business activities and a transfer from the TSX Venture
Exchange to the NEX board of the TSX Venture, the Company has undergone several changes. The Company
was reactivated and re-listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, changed its name to Pelonis Energy Corp, and
changed operations into an oil and gas company by way of initiatives that were approved by shareholders in
September 2004.
On July 13, 2005 the Company approved an amalgamation with a private company named RedStar Oil 8L Gas
Inc. (see note 15), which occurred on July 31, 2005, and then changed its name to RedStar Oil and Gas Inc.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
statements and the accompanying notes, As a result, actual results could differ from estimated amounts. These
ﬁnancial statemean have> in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of
materiality and within the framework of the accounting principles described below.
Measurement uncertainw
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles
. Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses
during the reporting year, Actual results can differ from those estimates
Recorded amounts for depletion, depreciation and accretion of oil and natural gas properties and equipment and
asset retirement obligations are based on estimates. The ceiling rest and impairment calculations are based on
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, future costs required to develop those reserves and the fair value of
improved properties. By their nature, these estimates of reserves and the related future cash ﬂows are subject to
measurement uncertainty, and the effect on the financial statements of future years could be signiﬁcant
' The values of convertible debenture obligations and asset retirement obligations depend on estimates of current
market interest rates and future restoration and reclamation expenditures. By their nature, these estimates are
subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the ﬁnancial statements of changes of estimates in future
periods could be signiﬁcant.
The amounts recorded as investment tax credits and the utilization of future tax assets subject to an expiry date
are based on estimates of future cash ﬂows and proﬁtability. By their nature, these estimates are subject to
measurement uncertainty and the effect on the ﬁnancial statements of changes of estimates in future periods
could be signiﬁcant,
The Black~Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input
of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s
employee’s stock options have characteristics signiﬁcantly different from those of traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
employee stock options. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect
on the financial statements of changes of estimates in future periods could be signiﬁcant

' 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

, The capital expenditures classiﬁcation made with respect to the renouncement of ﬂow—through shares is based
on estimates from geological information obtained and the classiﬁcation of the expenditures may be challenged
by the taxation authorities and in this regard the assessments may be different ﬁ‘om that of management. By
their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the ﬁnancial statements of
changes of estimates in future periods could be signiﬁcant.

Propzro} and Equipment

The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations whereby all costs
relating to the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves, including asset
retirement costs, are initially capitalized Such costs include land acquisition costs, geological and geophysical
expenses, carrying charges on non-producing properties, costs of drilling both productive and non-productive
Wells, related production equipment costs, asset retirement and abandonment coss and overhead charges
directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities.

Capitalized costs, excluding costs related to unproven properties, will be depleted and depreciated using the unit-
of-production method based on estimated proven oil and natural gas reserves before deduction of royalties as
determined by independent petroleum engineers. Petroleum and natural gas reserves and production are convened
to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil.

Costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are to initially be excluded from depletion calculations.

- These unevaluated properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred When
proved reserves are assigied or the property is considered to be impaired, the cost of the property or the amount of
the impairment is added to costs subject to depletion calculations.

Proceeds ﬁ‘om the sale of petroleum and natural gas properties will be applied against capitalized costs, with no
gain or loss recognized, unless such a sale would result in a greater than 20% change in the depletion and
depreciation rate.

The Company applies a two-stage ceiling test to capitalized costs to ensure that such costs do not exceed the
undiscounted future cash ﬂows from production of proved reserves Undiscounted future cash ﬂows are

' calculated based on management‘s best estimate of forward indexed prices applied to estimated future
production of proved reserves plus anticipated proceeds from the sale of undeveloped properties, less estimated
future operating costs, royalties net of Alberta Royalty Tax Credits, capital future development costs and
abandonment costs. When the carrying amount of a cost centre is not recoverable the second stage of the
process will determine the impairment whereby the cost centre would be written down to its fair value. The
second stage requires the calculation of discounted future cash ﬂows from proved plus probable reserves. The
fair value is estimated using the accepted present value techniques, which incorporate risks and other
uncertainties when determining expected cash flows.

Joint ventures
Certain of the Company‘s exploration and development activities are conducted jointly with others and
accordingly, the ﬁnancial statements reﬂect only the Company’s proportionate interest in such activities.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
7 Asset Retirement Obligations
During the year, the Company adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“ClCA”) Handbook
Section 3110, “Asset Retirement Obligations”. The new recommendations require that the recognition of the
fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long—lived assets be recorded in the year the
asset is put into use, with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset. The obligations
' recognized are statutory, contractual or legal obligations. The liability is accreted over time for changes in the
fair value of the liability through charges to accretion which are included in depletion, depreciation and
accretion expense. The costs capitalized to the related asses are amortized to earnings in a manner consistent
with the depletion and depreciation of the underlying asset.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased
Income taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, future income
tax assets and liabilities are measured based upon temporary differences between the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and their tax basis. Income tax expense (recovery) is computed based on the change during the
- year in the future tax assets and liabilities. Effects of changes in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when
substantively enacted.
F law-through shares
‘1‘ he Company has financed a portion of its exploration and development activities through the issue of ﬂow-
through shares. Under the terms of the ﬂow—throng] share agreements, the tax attributes of the related
expenditures are renounced to the subscribers at the effective date of renunciation provided it is likely that the
Company will incur qualiﬁed exploration and development expenditures Share capital is reduced and future
income tax liability is increased by the tax effected amount of the renounced tax deductions at the time of
' renunciation.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of oil and gas is recognized based on volume delivered at contractual delivery points and
rates. The costs associated with the delivery, including operating, transportation and production-based royalty
expenses, are recognized in the same year in which the related revenue is earned and recorded. Transportation
costs are recorded separately as part of the operating costs.
Hedging
During the year the Company may enter into fmancial instruments to hedge against adverse ﬂuctuations in
foreign exchange rates, electricity rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Payments or receipts on ﬁnancial
instruments that are designated and effective as hedges are recognized in income concurrently with the hedged
transaction If the hedge of an anticipated future transaction is terminated or if a hedge ceases to be effective,

Z. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Deferred charger
Costs incurred for the acquisition ofRedStar (Note 15), consist ofprofessional and agency fees that have been
deferred and will be charged to the transaction upon completion of the acquisition.
Financial instrument;
The Company carries a number of ﬁnancial instruments as detailed on the balance sheet. It is management's
opinion that the Company is not exposed to signiﬁcant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these
financial instruments The fair values of these ﬁnancial instruments approximate their carrying values, unless
otherwise noted.
Stock based compensation
The Company uses the fair value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees, consultants and
directors Stock-based compensation is recorded as an expense in the year, with a corresponding increase
recorded as contributed surplus. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of the
related stock option at the time of the grant and is recognized over the vesting ten-n of the option. When stock
options are exercised, related amounts previously accumulated as contributed surplus are credited to share
capital.
. Per share amounts
Per share amounts are calculated using the total weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. Diluted per share calculations reﬂect the exercise or conversion of potentially dilutive securities at the
later of the date of grant of such securities or the beginning of the year. The Company computes diluted
comings per share using the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock options.
Investment tax credits
The Company records investment tax credits on the cost reduction basis whereby investment tax credits related
7 to current expenditures are included in the determination of net income in the year the tax credits meet the
criteria of more likely than not realization. Investment tax credits related to the acquisition of property and
equipment are deducted ﬁom the related asset values. When the estimate is known to be materially different
from the actual recovery, an adjustment is made to net income in the period the determination is made. The
effect on the financial statements could be signiﬁcant.

3. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION (continued)
The undiscounted amount of cash ﬂows, required over the estimated reserve life of the underlying assets, to
: settle the obligation, adjusted for inﬂation, is estimated at $40,000. The obligation was calculated using a credit-
adjusted risk free discount rate of 9 percent and an inﬂation rate of 2 percent. It is expected that this obligation
will be funded from general Company resources at the time the costs are incurred with the majority of costs
expected to occur by 2007.

the period from inception on September 22, 2004 to December 31, 2004 adjusted to add the

5. Made enquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and
accounting matters of the Company about:
(a)
the basis for determination of the pro forma adjustments; and
(b) whether the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable regulatory requirements of the Securities Acts of the
various provinces in Canada.
The officials:
(a)
(b)
described to us the basis for determination of the pro forma adjustments; and
stated that the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial statements comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable regulatory requirements of the Securities Acts of the
various provinces in Canada.
6. Read the notes to the Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements, and found them to be
consistent with the basis described to us for determination of the pro forma adjustments.
7. Recalculated the application of the pro forma adjustments to the aggregate of the amounts in
the respective columns captioned “RedStar”, “Private RedStar”, “Avenir”, “Brownvale &
Kotcho Properties” as at September 30, 2005 and for the four-month period then ended and
for the year ended May 31, 2005 and found the amounts in the column captioned "RedStar
Pro Forma" to be arithmetically correct.
The Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements are based on management’s assumptions and
adjustments which are inherently subjective. The foregoing procedures are substantially less than
either an audit or a review, the objective of which is the expression of assurance with respect to
management's assumptions, the pro forma adjustments, and the application of the adjustments to
the historical financial information. Accordingly, we express no such assurance. The foregoing
procedures would not necessarily reveal matters of significance to the Pro Forma Consolidated
Financial Statements, and we therefore make no representation about the sufficiency of the
procedures for the purposes of a reader of such statements.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet of RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. (“RedStar” or 
“the  Company")  formerly  Pelorus  Energy  Corp.  as  at  September  30,  2005  and  the  unaudited  pro  forma 
consolidated statements of operations for the four month period then ended and year ended May 31, 2005 (the 
"Pro Forma Statements") have been prepared for inclusion in a prospectus for the issuance of 9,636,800 flow-
through  special  warrants  at  $3.30  per  warrant  and  4,925,900  common  share  special  warrants  at  $2.70  per

period then ended and the audited financial statements as at and for the year ended May 31, 2005.
The  Pro  Forma  Statements  have  been  prepared  from  information  derived  from  and  should  be  read  in 
conjunction with, the following:
(a)  The unaudited interim financial statements of RedStar as at and for the four months ended September 30,
2005 and the audited financial statements of RedStar as at and for the year ended May 31, 2005;
(b)  The unaudited interim financial statements of RedStar Oil & Gas Inc. (“Private RedStar”) as at and for the 
six months ended June 30, 2005 and the audited financial statements of Private RedStar as at December 31, 
2004 and for the period from inception on September 22, 2004 to December 31, 2004;

(“the Properties”) for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and the audited schedule of revenue, royalties

The Pro Forma Statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred in 
the  four  months  ended  September  30,  2005  and  the  year  ended  May  31,  2005  had  the  acquisition  of  Private 
RedStar  by  RedStar  been  effected  on  June  1,  2005  and  2004,  respectively.    In  preparing  these  pro  forma 
statements,  no  adjustments  have  been  made  to  reflect  the  operating  synergies  and  general  and  administrative 
costs  savings  that  may  result  from  combining  the  operations  of  RedStar,  Private  RedStar  and  Avenir.  In  the 
opinion of management, the Pro Forma Statements include all necessary adjustments for a fair presentation of 
the ongoing entity.

(i)  Avenir Resources (2003) Ltd.  did not commence active operations until the second half of 
2004 therefore no adjustment is required to annualize the operations to a June 30th year end.
(e)  On  May  3,  2005  the  Private  RedStar  acquired  certain  oil  and  gas  properties  from  a  non-related  industry 
partner  in  consideration  for  cash.    To  give  pro  forma  recognition  of  the  acquisition  additional  revenue, 
royalties  and  operating  costs  have  been  recorded  from  June  1,  2004  and  include  the  ten-month  month 
period to April 30, 2005, as the results of operations are included in Private RedStar commencing May 3, 
2005.
(f)  Pursuant  to  an  agreement  which  closed  November  1,  2004,  RedStar  completed  an  acquisition  of  certain 
producing  natural  gas  assets  in  the  Verger  and  Gilby  areas  for  cash  consideration  of  $1,121,900  before 
adjustments. To give pro forma recognition of the acquisition of these assets as at June 1, 2004, additional 
petroleum revenue of $ 62,424, royalties of $571, and operating expenses of $74,563 has been recorded in 
2005.
(g)  Depreciation, depletion and accretion expense has been adjusted by $2,273,600 to reflect the application of 
the appropriate unit–of–production rate for the full cost pool allocated to RedStar based on the estimated 
proved  petroleum  and  natural  gas  reserves  as  determined  by  independent  reserve  engineers  after 
adjustments for the transactions described in Note 2(c), Note 2(d), Note 2(e) and Note 2(f). The expense has 
also  been  adjusted  to  reflect  the  accretion  of  $12,000  on  the  asset  retirement  obligation  of  RedStar.  An 
adjustment  of  $779,900  has  been  recorded  to  reflect  the  effect  of  a  future  income  tax  recovery  of  the 
additional depreciation, depletion and accretion expense.
(h)  Future  taxes  have  been  adjusted  by  $788,500  to  reflect  the  operations  of  the  Brownvale  and  Kotcho 
properties  acquired  by  Private  RedStar  (Note  2(e)  and  the  operations of  the  Verger and Gilby  properties 
acquired by RedStar (Note 2(f)).
