<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence 
within the borders of each State, and to leave any country, including his or her own, and to 
return to his or her country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the obligations of States under international human rights law, 
humanitarian law and refugee law, in particular with regard to the principle of non-
refoulement,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling<b> </b>also<b> </b></i>the responsibility of States to take the requisite steps in accordance 
with their international obligations to provide persons in distress at sea, including persons 
fleeing the recent events in North Africa, with assistance,  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Affirming </i>that crimes and human rights violations against migrants continue to pose 
a serious challenge and require a concerted international assessment and response and 
genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for their 
eradication, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses its alarm</i> at the continuing vulnerable situation of migrants and 
asylum-seekers who have suffered untold hardship and, in some cases, even death as they 
attempt to flee recent events in North Africa; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also expresses its alarm</i> at the fact that, after having been compelled to make 
dangerous journeys, including in crowded and unsafe boats, the above-mentioned migrants 
are subjected to life-threatening exclusion, detention, rejection and xenophobia; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further expresses its alarm</i> at the fact that, since the beginning of the recent 
events in North Africa, there have been several reports of boats sinking and, in this regard, 
notes with sadness the death at sea of several hundreds of people, mostly African citizens, 
after their boats sank and that, according to accounts of survivors and family members, 
more than one thousand two hundred people are still unaccounted for;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> the efforts made by countries of destination on the northern 
shores of the Mediterranean sea to host migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events 
in North Africa, as well as the greater efforts made by neighbouring north African 
countries, which impose on them a disproportionate burden, and commends, for their 
solidarity, the Governments and people of those countries, humanitarian actors, including 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International 
Organization for Migration, the International Committee of the Red Cross, international and 
local non-governmental organizations and those Governments and individuals who have 
supported their activities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms<b> </b>the need</i> to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement,  
including in the context  of people fleeing events in North Africa;   
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i> that countries of destination should deal with the arrival of 
thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa, including 
its humanitarian dimension, in accordance with international obligations under international 
human rights law;  
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Calls for</i> a comprehensive inquiry by countries of destination into the very 
troubling allegations that sinking vessels carrying migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing the 
recent events in North Africa were abandoned to their fate despite the ability of European 
ships in the vicinity to rescue them, and welcomes the call made by the Council of Europe 
in this regard on 9 May 2011;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay 
particular attention to the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in 
North Africa described in the present resolution, to report to the Human Rights Council at 
its eighteenth session and to provide updates thereon; </p>


<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and all 
other relevant special procedures mandate holders to pay particular attention to the situation 
of persons fleeing by sea, including from recent events in North Africa, and who are denied 
assistance or rescue when approaching the countries of destination, and to report regularly 
thereon to the Human Rights Council.
