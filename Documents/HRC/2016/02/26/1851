<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, and is 
</p>
<p>entitled to a social and international order, in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, the 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977, other international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law instruments, and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 and decision 5/101 of 18 June 2007, and resolution 
</p>
<p>16/21 of 25 March 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular</i> that the Human Rights Council has the mandate to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>serve as a forum for dialogue on thematic issues on all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that millions of people around the world are affected by systematic 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and abuses in armed conflicts, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
</p>
<p>complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p>  
 
</p>
<p>* Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling </i>the principles and provisions related to international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, and to the promotion of responsible action by States, 
</p>
<p>contained in the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the General Assembly on 2 April 2013,1 as 
</p>
<p>well as in other relevant instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all efforts should be made to ensure the cessation of all violations 
</p>
<p>and abuses of, and the full respect for, international human rights law and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law in armed conflicts, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses its deep concern </i>at the fact that arms transfers to those involved in 
</p>
<p>armed conflicts may seriously undermine the human rights of civilians, especially women, 
</p>
<p>children, the elderly, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Notes with alarm</i> that such arms transfers can have a seriously negative 
</p>
<p>impact on the human rights of women and girls, who may be disproportionately affected by 
</p>
<p>the widespread availability of arms, as it may increase the risk of sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, and may also contribute to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> all States to refrain from transferring arms to those involved in armed 
</p>
<p>conflicts when they assess that such arms could be used to commit or facilitate serious 
</p>
<p>violations or abuses of international human rights law or international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Invites</i> all relevant special procedures, commissions of inquiry and human 
</p>
<p>rights treaty bodies to bear the present resolution in mind, within the framework of their 
</p>
<p>respective mandates, when considering the situation of human rights in armed conflicts.
