<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions conducted 
an official visit to Turkey from 26 to 30 November 2012. The objective of the visit was to 
examine the current status of respect for the right to life in law and in practice in Turkey. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur presents his main findings and puts forward 
recommendations to ensure better protection of the right to life in Turkey. Following a 
series of recent reforms, the level of unlawful killings in Turkey has decreased dramatically 
as compared with the 1990s. However, the current level of violations of the right to life still 
raises concern. The report outlines the main areas of persisting challenges and finds that the 
current patterns of killings in Turkey involve, inter alia, the lethal consequences of 
excessive use of force by the security forces, as well as killings of different vulnerable 
persons, in particular women. The most important and urgent challenge is the lack of 
accountability in cases of killings, both those perpetrated recently and those from the 
1990s.

<p> <b>I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Turkey, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns, conducted an official visit 
to the country from 26 to 30 November 2012. The objective of the visit was to examine the 
current level of protection of the right to life in law and in practice in Turkey.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for its invitation to visit the 
country and for having facilitated the smooth conduct of the visit with full respect for his 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Ankara and Diyarbakir. He had the opportunity to 
meet with the Human Rights Presidency of the Prime Ministry, the Minister of Justice, 
high-level officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of 
Interior, Ministry of Family and Social Policies and the Presidents of the Human Rights 
Inquiry Commission and the Uludere Sub-commission of the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly (TGNA). He also held meetings at the Court of Cassation and met with a 
representative of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, as well as visited the Sincan 
prison. In Diyarbakir, he met with the Deputy Governor of Diyarbakir and high-level 
officials of the Provincial Gendarmerie Command and the Provincial Security Directorate. 
In addition, he held meetings with the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Country 
Team, the European Union (EU) delegation in Turkey, the Council of Europe programme 
office, as well as a wide range of domestic and international non-governmental 
organizations, academics, judges, lawyers and families of victims. Informal meetings with 
civil society in Istanbul were also held prior to the start of the official visit. 
</p>
<p>4. A previous Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
undertook an official visit to Turkey in 2001. In her report1, she put forward a number of 
recommendations aimed at ensuring a higher level of protection of the right to life in 
Turkey. The current Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to examine, inter alia, the 
follow-up to those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur notes that Turkey has recently undertaken a series of reforms 
and measures to improve the situation of human rights. While significant challenges persist, 
progress and the ongoing efforts of reform should be acknowledged. Turkey is currently 
deeply engaged with the European regional human rights system, as well as with the EU, 
through accession negotiations. Cooperation with United Nations mechanisms has also 
evolved considerably, with adherence to a significant number of human rights treaties and 
the extension in March 2001 of a standing invitation to all thematic special procedures 
mandate holders of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR). Also noteworthy are the domestic initiatives to incorporate human rights norms 
at the national level.  
</p>
<p>6. The level of extrajudicial executions in Turkey has dramatically decreased compared 
to the situation in the early 1990s. Current instances of violations of the right to life and 
related practices such as torture and enforced disappearances must be measured on a very 
different scale.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the abolition of the death penalty in all 
circumstances in 2004, as well as Turkey&#8217;s ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, on 27 September 2011. 
</p>
<p>8. However, the current number of violations of the right to life still raises significant 
concern, both in terms of recent killings and failure to ensure accountability, including for 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1  E/CN.4/2002/74/Add.1 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>violations committed in the past. As will be elaborated in this report, there is need to place 
the security of individuals, as opposed to State security, first. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes that any analysis of Turkey&#8217;s human rights record 
should take into account the country&#8217;s challenges in fighting terrorism. The fight against 
terrorism was frequently referred to by the various Turkish authorities met as the main 
challenge to advancing on reforms, including a slower rate of implementation. While fully 
aware of the consequences of this scourge, the Special Rapporteur stresses the importance 
of countering it in strict compliance with applicable international human rights standards.2 
</p>
<p>10. This report was completed on 4 March 2013. As per the practice of the mandate on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in order to facilitate follow-up with the 
State with respect to the recommendations, another report will be prepared in two years.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from excessive use of force by security officers 
</b></p>
<p>11. Deaths result from excessive use of force by security officers in the context of, inter 
alia, demonstrations and arrest. The international standards on the use of force by security 
officers stipulate that lethal force may only be used as a last resort in order to protect life, in 
line with the principles of necessity and proportionality. The use of lethal force that does 
not respect these principles constitutes arbitrary deprivation of life and therefore violates 
the right to life. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur found that the Turkish legal framework surrounding possible 
deprivation of life in the context of use of force is in many instances insufficiently precise 
and may lead to an overly broad interpretation of the conditions under which lethal force is 
permissible and life may be exceptionally taken.  
</p>
<p>13. The very narrow understanding under international human rights law of the terms 
&#8220;proportionality&#8221; and &#8220;necessity&#8221; &#8211; namely, that life may be taken only in response to an 
immediate threat to life &#8211; should be emphasized in this context. As will be pointed out in 
this section, these terms, while present in several legal texts, are given a different and more 
permissive meaning in a number of legal provisions in Turkey. 
</p>
<p>14. Article 17 of the  Turkish Constitution states that everyone has the right to life, but 
stipulates that &#8220;cases such as the act of killing in self-defence, occurrences of death as a 
result of the use of a weapon permitted by law as a necessary measure during apprehension, 
the execution of warrants of arrest, the prevention of the escape of lawfully arrested or 
convicted persons, the quelling of riot or insurrection, or carrying out the orders of 
authorized bodies during martial law or state of emergency, are outside of the scope of the 
provision of paragraph 1&#8221;. Given that the relevant article, or other articles in the 
Constitution, do not contain explicit provisions forbidding the arbitrary deprivation of life, 
referring to the non-derogability of the right to life, or outlining the international human 
rights law understanding of the principles of necessity and proportionality, there is a risk 
that the interpretation of article 17 is very broad, resulting in an inadequate understanding 
of the conditions under which life may be taken.  
</p>
<p>15. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the Constitutional 
provisions related to the right to life should be reviewed, ideally as part of the current 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 2 International concern has been expressed, in particular, about the broad and vague definition of 
</p>
<p>terrorism in Turkey. See, inter alia, A/HRC/20/14/Add.2, paras. 102-103.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Constitutional review process, to reflect the international understanding of the right to life,3 
as described in the previous paragraphs of this section. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the use of force by law enforcement agents, the relevant domestic 
legal provisions are contained in Law No. 2559 on the Duties and Powers of the Police, as 
amended in 2007 by Law No. 5681;  Law No. 2803 on the Organization, Duties and Powers 
of the Gendarmerie, and related regulation.  
</p>
<p>17. These provisions grant the security forces vague and therefore potentially wide 
powers to use force in response to resistance or escape, which go beyond the powers 
permitted under international law. Specifically, paragraph 7 (c) of the amended article 16  
of the Law on the Duties and Powers of the Police authorizes the use of lethal force for 
purposes such as capturing a fleeing suspect who poses no risk to life. Although the term 
proportionality is referred to, the relevant provision stipulates that the force used must be 
&#8220;in proportion to apprehending the subject,&#8221; rather than to the need to protect life as 
provided under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>18. Moreover, the Law on the Duties and Powers of the Police states that a law 
enforcement officer is required first to give a stop warning, by calling upon the suspect to 
freeze and by shooting in the air. The officer is then authorized to use firearms against the 
suspect for the purposes of apprehension. The procedure and circumstances for giving this 
warning is ambiguous, and the assessment of the situation is left to the discretion of the 
individual officer at that instant. Taken together, the omission of the requirement to protect 
life and the ambiguity of the stop warning procedure result in a dangerously large granting 
of power to use lethal force, and open the way for unlawful killing. The Special Rapporteur 
received reports from credible non-governmental sources that more than 50 individuals 
were killed in 2011 by excessive use of firearms by law enforcement officers, when those 
individuals allegedly failed to obey stop warnings.4 
</p>
<p>19. The use of so-called &#8220;less lethal&#8221; weapons, such as pepper spray and tear gas, can 
also constitute lethal force if they are used in an excessive manner that results in death, of 
which the Special Rapporteur heard several times. The lawfulness of such use is regulated 
by the same principles of proportionality and necessity &#8211; as understood under international 
human rights law &#8211; as any other weapon employed by law enforcement officials. To the 
extent that the weapons have been used excessively not to save life, but to maintain public 
order, these cases may also constitute unlawful killing. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Unlawful deaths in counter-terrorism operations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The fight against terrorism in Turkey presents a number of significant challenges for 
compliance with international human rights standards, including in terms of protection of 
the right to life. In some important respects, the legal system does not meet international 
standards.  
</p>
<p>21. The legal framework for counter-terrorism operations contains serious ambiguities, 
which are similar to those identified in the legal provisions governing the use of force by 
the police and gendarmerie. In particular, additional article 2 of Law No. 3713 to Fight 
Terrorism, as amended in 2006, fails to stipulate that the use of lethal force should be a last 
resort in order to protect life. Instead, the law authorizes officials to use firearms directly 
and unhesitatingly in cases where alleged terrorists are encountered and they do not obey an 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 3 See, inter alia, principles 9 and 10 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
</p>
<p>Enforcement Officials, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990. 
</p>
<p> 4 See also Human Rights Association, &#8220;Account of the Human Rights Violations in Turkey in 2011.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>order to surrender, or where they attempt to use firearms themselves. The disjunctive is of 
further concern because it may be understood as suggesting that lethal force may be 
authorized even when unarmed &#8220;terrorists&#8221; refuse to surrender. Proportionality is 
mentioned with regard to the objective of rendering the danger ineffective, but without 
naming the immediate protection of life. In addition, the Special Rapporteur heard of a 
number of cases where civilians were mistakenly identified as terrorists and killed in 
counter-terrorism operations. He therefore stresses the need for counter-terrorism 
operations to develop a thorough method of identification of the alleged terrorists, so as to 
avoid mistakes and civilian harm. 
</p>
<p>22. In this context, of great concern are the events that occurred near Ortasu (Roboski) 
village in the Uludere District of Sirnak Province on 28 December 2011, when Turkish 
military jets bombed and killed 34 civilians, 17 of whom were reportedly children. The 
individuals were apparently carrying out smuggling operations over the border with Iraq, 
possibly for subsistence purposes. They reportedly did not exhibit aggression, and no 
attempts to engage with them non-lethally were undertaken.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes that a judicial investigation into the incident was 
launched in Diyarbakir, and a parliamentary inquiry process was initiated under the 
competences of the Uludere Sub-commission of the TGNA, which is required to issue a 
report on its findings. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the judicial 
investigation has not yet made significant progress at the time of drafting this report; he  
stresses the need to ensure a prompt, effective and impartial investigation into this incident, 
with the aim of bringing those responsible to justice.   
</p>
<p>24. With regard to the parliamentary inquiry established on this case, the Special 
Rapporteur met during his visit with the President of the Uludere Sub-commission of the 
Human Rights Inquiry Commission of the TGNA; he welcomes the establishment of the 
parliamentary inquiry body on this case. In parallel, the Special Rapporteur noted a number 
of serious limitations to the mandate and methods of work of this Sub-commission, which 
cast doubt on its eventual capacity to fully establish the circumstances of the incident and 
identify all the perpetrators. In view of the lack of progress with the judicial inquiry, the 
shortcomings of the parliamentary process are all the more apparent. Specifically, the lack 
of transparency in the inquiry work is of concern. The Special Rapporteur noted that very 
limited information is disclosed to the public, who are not aware of the content of the 
evidence available to the Sub-commission. He was also informed that the content of the 
evidence used would likewise not be disclosed in the Sub-commission&#8217;s report. This creates 
a risk that its final conclusions will not be understood in the context of their rationales, and 
that there will be no method available to the public to be able to scrutinize the thoroughness 
and reliability of the findings.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was informed and assured at various levels, including by the 
President of the Sub-commission, that its report would be published by 15 December 2012.  
At the time of drafting this visit report, he notes with grave concern that not only did that 
date pass without the production of the said parliamentary report, but the one-year 
anniversary of the tragic event also passed without further sign of accountability from the 
Government processes. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to 
take urgent action on this matter, which will constitute a test of Turkey&#8217;s genuine 
commitment to human rights and efforts to ensure accountability at all levels. 
</p>
<p>26. Further, the Sub-commission was not empowered to carry out extensive judicial-type 
investigations or to sanction perpetrators or offer redress. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur stresses once again that, irrespective of the results of the parliamentary inquiry, 
the high and urgent priority of the Turkish authorities should lie in ensuring prompt, 
effective and impartial judicial proceedings into the Uludere incident. Where appropriate, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p>proceedings should include criminal prosecution and sanction that take into account chain-
of-command responsibility at the highest level, as well as individual direct action.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless acknowledges information from Government 
officials that the Turkish Armed Forces make efforts to apprehend alleged terrorist suspects 
without lethal force whenever possible. Attention was brought to a case earlier in December 
2011 at Cudi Mountain in Sirnak province, where the armed forces were apparently 
successful in obtaining the surrender, without fatalities, of alleged members of the 
Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party (PKK), operating in a seven-storey-high cave in the mountain. 
The Special Rapporteur encourages the authorities to apply such methods of non-fatal 
engagement and opportunity for surrender as much as possible in counter-terrorism 
operations.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Village guard system 
</b></p>
<p>28.  During the visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that the village guard system in 
Turkey is operating and accounts for a force of tens of thousands. Officially known as 
&#8220;temporary village guards,&#8221; and established in the 1980s, village guards are civilian 
villagers who are armed and paid by the State to participate in military or counter-terrorism 
operations alongside the regular security forces.   
</p>
<p>29. Village guards have reportedly been involved in human rights violations. The 
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found them responsible for violations of the 
right to life,5 and expressed concern about their functioning &#8220;outside the normal structure of 
discipline and training applicable to gendarmes and police officers,&#8221; and thus about the fact 
that &#8220;it was not apparent what safeguards there were against wilful or unintentional abuses 
of position carried out by the village guards.&#8221; 6  In 2012, the Council of Europe 
Commissioner for Human Rights endorsed the conclusions of the ECtHR, and called on 
Turkey to examine the possibility of abolishing the system of village guards.7   
</p>
<p>30. Following her visit to Turkey in 2001, the Special Rapporteur recommended in her 
report the abolition of the village guard system. While the size of the force has been 
reduced, the Government of Turkey has not yet brought an end to the system. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>31. Turkey has registered a significant decrease of deaths in custody due, inter alia, to 
efforts to improve prison conditions and surveillance. However, the Special Rapporteur  
received several credible reports that deaths in custody still occur, the majority appearing to 
occur after torture or ill-treatment. Although Turkey has instituted a zero-tolerance policy 
on torture, which is commendable, it must be translated into uniform practice. The Special 
Rapporteur recalls his visit to the Sincan prison and hopes that the impressive conditions 
witnessed in the part of the prison visited and the oversight procedures described can be 
achieved in all prisons throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>32. According to reports from non-governmental organizations, over 40 individuals died 
in prison and detention in 2011.8 One human rights organization met with during the visit 
reported that in 90 per cent of the cases in which it requested surveillance camera footage 
</p>

</p>
<p>from the security facility where torture or death was alleged to have taken place, the 
response was that the cameras were broken or otherwise non-functional for the period in 
question. There were also instances where the prosecutor or judge did not seek to have such 
footage made a part of the case.   
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s intention to establish a national 
preventive mechanism under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. He 
calls for this to be done without delay.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Suspicious suicides of military conscripts and law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>34. A number of soldiers and some law enforcement officials were pronounced dead by 
suicide last year. In some 45 of these cases, information suggests that suicide may have 
been falsified or forced.  
</p>
<p>35. Formal investigations were either never brought, or else quickly stalled, in nearly all 
cases and did not result in the identification of perpetrators or subsequent prosecution.  
Because investigations were conducted in a closed manner within the police or military&#8217;s 
internal justice system, it is impossible for the families and civil society to know whether 
these are in fact cases of unlawful killing, and to ensure accountability. In some cases, they 
do not even know whether a full and impartial investigation was conducted. Inadequate 
access to surveillance camera footage and other evidence compounds the problem.  
</p>
<p>36. Failures of transparency result in suspicious suicides being neither confirmed nor 
denied through appropriate legal channels. This trend indicates the need for proper and 
transparent oversight of the security forces, including the military. In addition to preventive 
monitoring, this also requires a functional mechanism for complaints, investigation and 
accountability for those violations that occur.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to respect of the right to life by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Deaths resulting from attacks by armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>37. Unlawful deaths result in Turkey from attacks by various armed groups, including in 
the form of alleged terrorist attacks. According to data provided by the Turkish National 
Police during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, in the period from January 2008 to November 
</p>
<p>2012, terrorist-related incidents that occurred in areas under police jurisdiction led to the 
death of 109 civilians, 45 soldiers, 51 policemen and 74 persons considered as terrorists by 
the Government. Similar data provided by the General Command of the Gendarmerie 
indicate for the same period in areas under gendarmerie jurisdiction, the death of 104 
civilians, 547 security officers and 1,110 alleged terrorists. The Special Rapporteur heard in 
particular of the recent bombing in the city of Gaziantep which occurred on 20 August 2012 
and reportedly left 10 people dead, including four children. 
</p>
<p>38. Terrorism poses serious threats to the right to life of law enforcement officials and, in 
particular, of innocent civilians. The State has a duty to protect its people against such 
attacks, by taking the necessary measures to prevent their occurrence, bring to justice the 
established perpetrators, and ensure appropriate compensation to the victims of such attacks 
and their families. As already stated, this challenge needs to be confronted in strict 
compliance with applicable international human rights standards. </p>

<p><b> B. Deaths resulting from violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>39. Deaths and threats to the lives of women in Turkey were raised as a serious concern 
during the visit. The Special Rapporteur received information of deaths of women resulting 
from domestic violence and, in particular, from so-called honour killings. A non-
governmental organization reported that in 2011, over 100 women were killed due to 
domestic violence. This is in line with data provided during the visit by the Ministry of 
Interior, which indicate that 107 individuals were killed in domestic intentional homicides 
within the first nine months of 2012. Of these, 35 were registered as honour killings.  
</p>
<p>40. Several interlocutors in Turkey stated that a distinction should be made between 
honour killings and other types of killing of women. According to them, in the case of 
honour killings, in which the perpetrator evokes honour as the motive for killing, the family 
assumes the role of the judge and organizes and executes the killing. According to 
information received, recent trends consist of having a younger member of the family 
perform the execution, because if punished, the minor would receive a lighter sentence due 
to age, or of forcing the victim to commit suicide so that there is no identifiable perpetrator.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur had the impression that the Turkish authorities do recognize 
the persistence of the challenge of lethal violence against women and the Government has 
taken a number of measures to combat it. However, there is need to further step up efforts 
on prevention and accountability.  
</p>
<p>42. From a prevention point of view, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the ratification by 
Turkey of the new Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence 
against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention), and its publication in the 
Official Gazette on 8 March 2012. He commends the adoption of Law No. 6284 on 
Protection of the Family and Prevention of Violence Against Women which entered into 
force on 20 March 2012, as well as the efforts to establish a National Action Plan on the 
fight against domestic violence. He notes the significant number of training and awareness-
raising programmes on violence against women undertaken throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>43. However, further solid efforts need to be undertaken with regard to the effective and 
swift implementation of the new legal framework. Particular importance should be attached 
to efforts related to the effective functioning of the protection orders system and the 
creation of a sufficient number of shelters for women. The Special Rapporteur received 
information regarding difficulties faced by women who report domestic violence to law 
enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers sometimes do not pay serious attention to 
cases of domestic violence, considering such cases as family matters, and attempting to 
convince the woman to reconcile with her abuser, rather than seek a protection order or 
pursue other legal options. In addition, victims reportedly face additional obstacles if they 
do seek protection orders, due to reluctance on the part of judicial professionals, lengthy 
processes and administrative barriers to issuing the order. Finally, once issued, protection 
orders are often not properly enforced and monitored, which leaves the victim at a high risk 
of further abuse. 
</p>
<p>44.  In reply to these findings, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that in 
the areas under the responsibility of the gendarmerie, protection orders were issued for 
5,897 women in 2012. In addition, the Regulation on the Implementation of Law No. 6284, 
which entered into force on 18 January 2013, states that reconciliation or intermediary 
processes cannot be suggested between the victim of the violence and the perpetrator at the 
time of issuing or executing protective or preventive injunctions. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes these strengthened measures, while underlining the need for their effective 
enforcement. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur commends the steps taken by Turkey to increase the number 
and capacity of shelters for women, as reported by Turkey to the Human Rights Committee 
in 2012.9 He stresses the need to continue efforts to increase the number of shelters, as well 
as address the issues of adequate resourcing and support services for women leaving the 
shelters. 
</p>
<p>46. Proper accountability mechanisms, in particular in terms of serious and dissuasive 
punishment for violence against women, constitute another dimension that the authorities 
should address, in particular in cases of honour killing. The 2005 Penal Code provides for a 
significant measure in this regard by abolishing the de facto reductions of sentences for 
perpetrators involved in honour killings with the aim of ensuring that they receive the 
highest sentences. However, in present practice, honour killings may still receive lighter 
sentences. In this respect, article 82 of the Penal Code, which regulates crimes punishable 
by aggravated life imprisonment, refers, in paragraph (k), to &#8220;custom killing&#8221; (under the 
term &#8220;t&#246;re&#8221;) rather than &#8220;honour killing&#8221; (under the term &#8220;namus&#8221;). This has led to uneven 
legal interpretation of this article, where some courts have found that honour killing does 
not fall under &#8220;custom killing&#8221; and therefore is not covered by the provisions of article 82, 
paragraph (k). The Special Rapporteur notes that this concern has been expressed by 
various United Nations committees, most recently by the Human Rights Committee.10 He 
calls upon the Turkish authorities to take firm steps to ensure that honour killings are 
consistently interpreted as crimes falling under article 82, paragraph (k), of the Penal Code. 
He further stresses the importance of taking parallel measures such that all suspected 
honour killings receive prompt, impartial and effective investigation, as well as 
appropriately severe sanctions against perpetrators.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals 
</b></p>
<p>47. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals are also particularly 
vulnerable to attacks, including lethal attacks, in Turkey. This occurs in the context of a 
generally hostile climate towards LGBT individuals, who often face discrimination and 
intimidation as well as negative stereotyping, including from high-level public figures and 
law enforcement agents. According to information provided by non-governmental 
organizations, there were eight murders in 2011 and 12 murders in 2010 that are believed to 
have been committed on the grounds of the victims&#8217; sexual orientation or gender identity. 
</p>
<p>48. In Turkey, killings of LGBT individuals usually occur either in the context of 
expression of hate or as part of the phenomenon of honour killings. With regard to hate-
related incidents, the Special Rapporteur heard information on the lack of comprehensive 
specific legislation regarding hate speech and hate crimes, as well as a general absence of 
language on gender identity and sexual orientation in Turkish legislation, including in the 
most recent legislative texts. This creates a gap in the legal framework with regard to the 
protection of LGBT individuals. 
</p>
<p>49. Another difficulty lies in the attitude of family members of LGBT individuals, who, 
sometimes due to so-called honour motives, insist that the investigation files in cases of 
murder are closed as soon as possible. Family members can also perpetrate murders of 
LGBT individuals in the name of honour. A prominent case concerns Ahmet Yildiz, a 26 
year old man believed to have been killed in 2008 by his father who viewed his son&#8217;s 
homosexuality as disgraceful to the family. Ahmet Yildiz reportedly addressed the 
Prosecution Office three times to seek protection against death threats, but his requests 
were never followed up with a protection order. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>11 
</b></p>
<p>50. There appears to be a trend in Turkey for law enforcement officers and the judiciary 
to take a lenient attitude towards crimes against LGBT individuals. LGBT individuals are 
rarely treated seriously when they seek protection, and investigations and prosecution of 
crimes against them display fundamental shortcomings, leading to impunity of perpetrators. 
This was also confirmed by reports from other organizations.11 Problems related to reprisals 
and lighter sentencing of perpetrators, which have considerable application to the killings of 
LGBT individuals and failures of accountability for such crimes in Turkey, will be 
addressed in chapter IV of this report. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Right to life of journalists  
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur received information on the risks faced by journalists in the 
performance of their activities. Journalists are often targets of death threats as a 
consequence of their work. The investigation process into the death threats and killings of 
journalists suffer from the same challenges of delayed and ineffective investigation.  
</p>
<p>52. The case of the murder of the Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, killed in January 
2007, is a prominent example. Reports indicate that the murder could have been prevented 
had the security forces acted diligently. In this regard, the ECtHR held that the Turkish 
State had failed to protect the life of Hrant Dink.12 With regard to accountability, the court 
case ended on 17 January 2012, and resulted in the conviction of one person for incitement 
to murder; and the acquittal of the other defendants. The Special Rapporteur takes note of 
the information that, following an inquiry by the Presidential State Inspection Board, the 
family of Hrant Dink requested a new investigation into the possible involvement of 
various law enforcement officers. He hopes that a prompt, impartial and thorough judicial 
process will be ensured on this case. He also stresses the importance of ensuring 
accountability of all involved in death threats and killings of journalists.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>53. Impunity is the main challenge concerning the right to life in Turkey. Numerous 
interlocutors echoed the sentiments expressed by one interviewee that, &#8220;We have a culture 
of not punishing.&#8221; This challenge needs to be addressed with regard to both the crimes 
committed in the 1990s and more recent killings. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings in the 1990s and mass graves</b>13<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. The legacy of the 1990s includes thousands of unresolved execution-type killings, 
deaths in custody and enforced disappearances by suspected State perpetrators, as well as 
execution-type killings believed to have been committed by the PKK. 
</p>
<p>55. Only a handful of trials have been conducted regarding this period. There seems to be 
political reluctance to engage with the issue, and time &#8211; in the form of the increasing age of 
potential suspects and witnesses, deteriorating evidence, and the statute of limitations &#8211; 
should not be allowed to elapse before accountability for this dark period in the country&#8217;s 
</p>

 12 See <i>Dink v. Turkey</i>, ECtHR Chamber Judgement of 14 September 2010. 
 13 While the Government commented that the term &#8220;mass graves&#8221; is misleading, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recalls that this term is used by several international and non-governmental organizations. For 
example, see European Commission, &#8220;Turkey: 2012 Progress Report&#8221; (SWD(2012) 336 final), 10 
October 2012, pp. 20 and 72. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>history is ensured. Shedding light on the killings of the 1990s and taking all necessary 
measures to bring to justice all perpetrators should constitute an imperative objective of the 
current authorities. In addition to investigating reported crimes by alleged terrorists, the 
State has a responsibility to ensure accountability where those who were entrusted with 
upholding the law have broken it. 
</p>
<p>56. The current process of uncovering mass graves raises particular concerns. The 
majority of the graves are believed to be from the period after 1980 and to contain the 
remains of individuals forcefully disappeared from detention and of militants of illegal 
organizations. While some exhumations have taken place recently, concern has been 
expressed that the method of excavation was inappropriate, such that human remains and 
other potential evidence was contaminated, lost or destroyed, and that families had little 
access to the results.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of political will to establish truth and 
justice with regard to these graves, irrespective of who the perpetrators were. This involves 
acknowledging the existence of the graves, undertaking their exhumation in a 
comprehensive and systematic way, and ensuring proper, independent and transparent 
investigation there into, in conformity with the United Nations Model Protocol for a legal 
investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions (&#8220;Minnesota Protocol&#8221;). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Effectiveness of investigations and length of proceedings    
</b></p>
<p>58. Impunity for more recent killings manifests itself in slow or inadequate investigations 
and prosecutions into cases where life has been lost. This is widely believed to be the result 
of a lack of political will to hold in particular State officials accountable. It is exacerbated 
by a deferential approach to the executive by prosecutors in such cases, shortcomings in the 
independent and effective functioning of the judiciary, inadequate forensic services and a 
lack of an independent complaints mechanism regarding the conduct of law enforcement 
officers. The report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
on her visit to Turkey in 201114 describes in detail the current challenges faced by the 
judiciary. The present report will therefore not extensively examine those issues.  
</p>
<p>59. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, there is the need to strengthen the capacity of crime 
scene investigations and proper collection of evidence. In cases surrounding misuse of 
authority, such as excessive use of force by the police, lack of impartial investigations and 
contamination of evidence were mentioned as a particular concern. In many cases, the same 
forces who may have perpetrated the killing are also responsible for the investigation, or 
else it is carried out by their colleagues who may be prejudiced. The Special Rapporteur 
heard about cases in which the crime scene was allegedly primed before the investigation, 
or in which there was undue delay between the occurrence of a shooting and the official 
reporting of the incident. He reiterates in this regard that it is a well-established principle 
that even the perception of bias should not be allowed to arise. 
</p>
<p>60. The challenges related to proper forensic and autopsy procedures should also be 
addressed as there are concerns about the impartiality of reports provided by the 
Government-affiliated Forensic Medicine Institute and about their late delivery. 15  Until 
recently, all autopsies had to be performed by this Institute, without the possibility of an 
alternative examination to challenge its findings. The ability to present an alternative 
evidence review, including autopsy reports, should be fully ensured and facilitated in 
</p>

 14 A/HRC/20/19/Add.3. 
 15 Similar findings were established by Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in his report 
</p>
<p>following his visit to Turkey from 10 to 14 October 2011 (CommDH(2012)2), 10 January 2012, 
para. 54. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13 
</b></p>
<p>practice. Transparency and efficiency should be ensured for the Forensic Medicine 
Institute&#8217;s functions. 
</p>
<p>61. Delay in judicial proceedings continues to constitute one of Turkey&#8217;s longstanding 
challenges and has clear implications for accountability. The Special Rapporteur commends 
the Government for various steps taken recently with the aim of reducing the length of 
proceedings, inter alia, through enacting the Third Judicial Reform Package and increasing 
the number of judges at the Court of Cassation. He calls for continued efforts in this area 
with the aim to solve this problem entirely. 
</p>
<p>62. While proceedings are lengthy and ineffective, the application of the statute of 
limitations for unlawful killing offences further aggravates the climate of impunity. The 
statute of limitations for investigation of murders in the previous Penal Code (Law No. 765) 
provides for a lapse of 20 years in principle for crimes committed before 2005. Under the 
present Turkish Penal Code, the whole investigation of crimes where the sentence is 
aggravated life imprisonment can run for 30 years. Under articles 76 and 77, respectively, 
the statute of limitations does not apply to genocide and crimes against humanity. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that a similar provision will soon be made for torture-
related offences through the Fourth Judicial Reform Package.   
</p>
<p>63. While this development is commendable, it should go further: the statute of 
limitations should be lifted at least for all crimes related to violations of the right to life. 
This is particularly important for those cases of unlawful killings from the early 1990s that 
will begin to time out under the law applicable at that time which stipulated a 20-year 
limitation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. De facto immunity of public officials 
</b></p>
<p>64. A number of civil society representatives and lawyers reported that they were unable 
to initiate legal proceedings in cases of unlawful killings by public officials because of lack 
of requisite administrative permission from the relevant Governor, which is allegedly 
required pursuant to Law No. 4483. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur was assured by the Government that under this law, such 
permission is no longer required for prosecutors when they bring cases against law 
enforcement officers or other public officials. However, many members of the public, 
including the families of the victims and their advocates, seem to think permission is still 
required and may neglect to pursue such legal advocacy because they believe permission 
will not be granted. Moreover, prosecutors continue to indicate the absence of such 
permission as a reason why prosecutions do not occur. This lack of clarity is worrying as it 
perpetuates a perception on the lack of accountability for public officials.  
</p>
<p>66. The low conviction rate of public officials in Turkey is another disincentive to lodge 
complaints. For instance, the trials surrounding the December 2000 prison operation 
&#8220;Return to Life&#8221; &#8211; in which 32 people were killed &#8211; are still ongoing 12 years later. Only 
recently have these proceedings advanced as key witnesses are being called for the 
Bayrampasa prison operation.  
</p>
<p>67. The foregoing barriers are reinforced by the fact that in many cases where a public 
official becomes the subject of investigation, that person is allowed to remain on active 
duty. Furthermore, in some cases officials who have been involved in or are suspected of 
having been involved in serious human rights violations are promoted, rather than 
prosecuted or convicted. This serves as a striking further disincentive to people to seek 
justice through official channels. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>68. The creation of an independent complaints mechanism is a crucial element to combat 
impunity of security officers and other authorities. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges 
the Government&#8217;s stated efforts to create such a mechanism, notably in the draft law on a 
Law Enforcement Monitoring Mechanism, submitted to the TGNA in March 2012. 
However, he is concerned that the commission to be established under this law will not 
have organizational, but only functional, independence. Chief Inspectors of the Ministry of 
Interior, for instance, will be in charge of examining the complaints. The contemplated 
commission&#8217;s strong ties to the Government raise concerns regarding its impartiality.  
</p>
<p>69. A fully independent oversight mechanism for the Turkish Armed Forces and military 
duties of the Gendarmerie should also be instituted in order to ensure accountability for 
violations of the right to life at all levels.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Reprisals 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur heard that many witnesses, families of victims and human 
rights organizations are subjected to reprisals and thus dissuaded from pressing charges or 
continuing with cases, which reinforces the perceived climate of impunity.  
</p>
<p>71. The main pattern of reprisals reported is the practice of filing countercharges against 
the relatives of the victim or organization, claiming interference with the investigation or 
judicial process. Countercharge cases often proceed much more swiftly than the 
investigation into the victim&#8217;s original case.  This concern has also been raised by, among 
others, the Council of Europe16, the EU17 and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>72. The case of Baran Tursun, who was fatally shot by the police in 2007 while driving, 
was mentioned in this regard, with reports on the numerous cases launched against his 
family, including, inter alia, for insulting the court and attempting to influence it. On the 
other hand, the proceedings against the police officers who killed him raised questions 
about the thoroughness of the judicial process and the sentences pronounced.   
</p>
<p>73. Other cases of reprisals involve intimidation and threats of witnesses, who might 
wish to testify, families and human rights advocates who would push for investigation, 
prosecutions or trial. The Special Rapporteur received reports of unwillingness on the part 
of witnesses to participate in legal proceedings due, inter alia, to pressure put on them not 
to testify or renounce the statements given, other forms of interference with testimonies or 
fear of personal harm. This is particularly problematic in the context of past violations that 
went unpunished and in relation to events in the south-east of the country, where 
individuals may feel uncomfortable coming forward with information or complaints.  
</p>
<p>74. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the need to strengthen 
witness and victim protection in Turkey so as to achieve an effective level of protection in 
practice. The existing programmes were reported to the Special Rapporteur as ineffective, 
as witnesses do not feel comfortable relying on them. While witness protection has been 
applied in Turkey in cases of organized crime and terrorism, their application in cases of 
other crimes, including violations of the right to life, appears to be minimal. Leakage of 
information, and thus the challenge of ensuring anonymity and confidentiality, was 
mentioned as a particular concern.  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Prosecutorial and judicial discretion 
</b></p>
<p>75. Prosecutorial and judicial discretion about how to shape the legal proceedings also 
plays into the absence of accountability for unlawful killings. This takes the form of 
decisions about which charges to bring, the penalties sought and the sentences delivered, 
and the acceptance of inappropriate mitigating factors or excuses. 
</p>
<p>76. Prosecutions for past violations, where they take place, are often conducted for 
crimes against the State, not crimes against individuals, in line with the undue emphasis on 
State, as opposed to individual, security mentioned in the introduction of this report. For 
example, the current prosecution concerning the surviving leaders of the 12 September 
1980 military coup, Kenan Evren and Tahsin Sahinkaya, is not for deaths in custody, 
murder and torture, but for overthrowing the Parliament and constitutional order in a 
military coup. PKK leader Abdullah &#214;calaan was also not prosecuted for murder, but for 
rising against the State. In such cases, there is no specific accountability for violations of 
the right to life. 
</p>
<p>77. There are cases where law enforcement officials, as well as non-State actors, had 
committed violations of the right to life, but were charged with offences other than killing &#8211;  
for instance, physical assault or another less violent crime &#8211;, resulting in very light 
sentences. Similarly, where it is possible to seek a lighter penalty or sentence for a certain 
offence, this is sometimes done by the prosecutor from the outset, signalling that the 
criminal responsibility is not taken seriously.  
</p>
<p>78. Even in cases where the perpetrator is charged with killing, sentences are sometimes 
significantly reduced by the judge further to a finding of &#8220;unjust provocation&#8221; under article 
29 of the Turkish Penal Code, whereby the defendant is considered less culpable because he 
acted under so-called provocation. The application of this principle can be inappropriate, 
for example, in some cases of honour killings and killings of LGBT individuals, where 
judges may, on the basis of their own moral convictions, impose a lighter sentence for 
murder. 
</p>
<p>79. In other cases, judges apparently reduce the sentence because of the &#8220;good conduct&#8221; 
of the defendant during legal proceedings. According to interlocutors, there is a tendency to 
reduce sentences in particular in cases of violence against women, killings of LGBT 
individuals or offences perpetrated by law enforcement officials.      
</p>
<p>80.  Following her visit to Turkey in 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers identified an overly close connection between judges and 
prosecutors, as well as between the judiciary and the executive, which casts doubt on the 
independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Turkey. 18  This issue also has clear 
implications for accountability in the context of the right to life. The Special Rapporteur 
found it encouraging that several officials interviewed were aware of the persistence of 
these challenges; he stresses the importance of taking effective measures to address them.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Role of human rights mechanisms in upholding the right to 
life 
</b></p>
<p>81. Turkey has undertaken a series of initiatives to establish mechanisms at the domestic 
level to uphold human rights. While these measures are welcome and may potentially lead 
to stronger protection of the right to life, the Special Rapporteur stresses that Turkey should 
prioritize efforts to render these mechanisms fully independent and effectively functional.   
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Creation of the Turkish Human Rights Institution 
</b></p>
<p>82. The process of creating the Turkish Human Rights Institution (THRI) has been 
followed closely by various international human rights mechanisms. The TGNA ultimately 
adopted Law No. 6332 on the THRI on 21 June 2012.  
</p>
<p>83. The creation of a national human rights institution is potentially an important step in 
strengthening the protection of human rights, including the right to life, in Turkey, in 
particular in terms of efforts to ensure accountability and redress in cases of violations. 
However, the Special Rapporteur heard a number of significant criticisms that may hamper 
the independent and effective functioning of this institution. First, the relevant law 
stipulates that the THRI is affiliated with the Prime Ministry, which may compromise its 
independence. Second, article 5 of the law further states that, out of the 11 members, two 
shall be selected by the President of the Republic, and seven by the Council of Ministers. 
The large majority of the members &#8211; nine out of 11 &#8211; are hence directly appointed by 
Government-affiliated entities.  In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, a more open, transparent 
and competitive appointment process would help to strengthen the independence of the 
institution. A third concern relates to the limited inclusion of the comments provided by the 
civil society in the final version of this law. These elements cast significant doubts on the 
possibility of ensuring the independence of the future THRI. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to underline the crucial importance of these elements in the process of ensuring 
compliance with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris 
Principles).19 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of ensuring the institutional 
independence of the THRI and the impartiality of its individual members, as well as its 
effective functioning and full discharge of its investigative powers. He also invites the 
Government of Turkey to consider reviewing the newly adopted law, in order to address the 
concerns expressed. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Creation of the Ombudsman Institution 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Ombudsman Institution was established in Turkey, following the adoption of the 
Law on the Ombudsman Institution on 14 June 2012. According to the law, the 
Ombudsman Institution is accountable to the Parliament and no one shall issue instructions 
to it. It shall examine complaints and make recommendations on the functioning of the 
administration with regard to the rule of law and human rights. At the time of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Mehmet Nihat Omeroglu, former judge of the Court of Cassation, had 
been appointed as the first Chief Ombudsman of Turkey. 
</p>
<p>86. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the establishment of the Ombudsman&#8217;s office is a 
potentially important addition to the range of institutions available to the public to file 
human rights complaints against public officials. Winning the trust of the public through 
the impartial and effective functioning of this institution, and manifesting a genuine 
commitment to human rights should be a priority of the newly appointed Ombudsman. 
However, some interlocutors have expressed their scepticism in this regard, noting that Mr. 
Omeroglu was among the judges in the Court of Cassation who had ruled that the murdered 
journalist, Hrant Dink, had &#8220;insulted Turkishness.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is furthermore concerned that the current mandate of the 
Ombudsman does not cover acts of the Turkish Armed Forces that are solely of a military 
nature. There is a risk that this shortcoming may lead to partial exclusion of the military 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p>from human rights scrutiny and accountability in the future, including with regard to the 
right to life. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur draws attention to several other instruments that may have a 
potentially positive impact on the protection of the right to life in Turkey.  
</p>
<p>89. One positive development is the September 2010 Constitutional amendment by  
which the public is granted the right of individual application to the Constitutional Court of 
Turkey after exhaustion of other remedies, where an individual may claim that any of her or 
his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights has been violated by the public 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>90. Another step that drew the attention of the Special Rapporteur is the recent creation 
of a Department of Human Rights at the Ministry of Justice, charged with ensuring 
Turkey&#8217;s effective implementation of and compliance with the judgements of the ECtHR. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of this department and hopes that its 
future activities will include respect of international human rights standards under the 
United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>91. Finally, the Special Rapporteur notes that Turkey is not yet a party to the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
nor has it acceded to the Rome Statue. Given the important impact that being a party to 
these instruments would have on the right to life and accountability for violations, the 
Special Rapporteur invites Turkey to adhere to these treaties. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Turkey has recently undertaken a number of significant measures to strengthen 
the protection of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Regarding the right to life, the level of extrajudicial executions in Turkey has 
dramatically decreased since the 1990s due, inter alia, to the reforms undertaken since 
</b></p>
<p><b>2000. However, serious concerns remain regarding deaths resulting from excessive use 
</b></p>
<p><b>of force by security officers, as well as killings of various vulnerable persons.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The main and most urgent challenge that Turkey should address is the fight 
against impunity for both ongoing and past killings. The pressing need lies not only in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the pursuit of justice and redress for victims and their families, but also in sending the 
</b></p>
<p><b>message to the public that violations of the right to life will not be tolerated. Major 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts should aim at ensuring accountability for killings perpetrated by State actors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as the effective and impartial functioning of the justice system in all instances.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Violations of the right to life by State actors 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Turkey should amend article 17 of its Constitution to bring the formulation of 
the right to life in line with international standards, by providing that no one shall be 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrarily deprived of his or her life or similar wording to that effect.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The laws regulating the use of force by law enforcement officers (Law No. 2559 
on the Duties and Powers of the Police; Law No. 2803 on the Organization, Duties and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Powers of the Gendarmerie, and related regulation) should be brought in line with </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>international standards. Both proportionality and necessity are crucial components of 
</b></p>
<p><b>these standards. The term</b>s &#8220;necessity&#8221; and<b> </b>&#8220;proportionality&#8221; <b>in these texts should 
</b></p>
<p><b>reflect their interpretation under international law: lethal use of force may be made 
</b></p>
<p><b>only as a last resort to protect life. Regulations on the stop warning procedure and on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the proportionate use of less lethal weapons should be promulgated and conform to 
</b></p>
<p><b>these standards.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Article 2 of Law No. 3713 to Fight Terrorism should likewise be amended to 
reflect the international interpretation </b>of the term &#8220;proportionality<b>,</b>&#8221; and <b>should 
</b></p>
<p><b>stipulate that lethal force shall only be used as a last resort where there is an imminent 
</b></p>
<p><b>threat to life.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Security officers should receive further training on the principles of necessity 
and proportionality, including on the appropriate use of methods other than lethal 
</b></p>
<p><b>weapons. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>There can be no justification for human rights violations in the name of counter-
terrorism measures. Operations to counter terrorism may resort to use of force only 
</b></p>
<p><b>when it is necessary and proportionate, as defined under international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law. Civilian harm should be minimized and civilians should never be targeted. Injury 
</b></p>
<p><b>or killing of civilians should be subjected to prompt and thorough investigation and, 
</b></p>
<p><b>where appropriate, accountability. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>An effective, prompt, impartial and transparent criminal investigation into the 
Uludere/Roboski incident should be undertaken as a matter of great priority. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals responsible should be held liable and sanctioned accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Responsibility should include those implicated in the chain of command, irrespective 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their position. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Uludere Sub-commission at the TGNA should release its overdue final 
report without delay, as well as ensure full transparency in its work and publish the 
</b></p>
<p><b>content of all evidence used for its findings. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Government should abolish the village guard system.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>All cases of suicide in the military or security services and deaths in custody 
should be reported promptly, as well as independently and publicly investigated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish the actual cause of death. Families and lawyers should have full access to this 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and to any other sources of evidence as well as the possibility for cross-
</b></p>
<p><b>check examinations. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The National Preventive Mechanism </b>should be set up in line with Turkey&#8217;s 
<b>obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>It should be ensured that surveillance cameras are fully operational in all 
security and detention facilities, including at military custody sites, and their footage 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be entirely and immediately available when it may provide evidence of abuse.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>There should be an independent channel through which military conscripts can 
complain of abuse or ill-treatment and these cases should be investigated. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Right to life and non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>There can be no justification under any circumstances for acts of terrorism. All 
groups engaged in terrorism should cease such activity with immediate effect.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Article 82, paragraph k, of the Penal Code should be understood to include 
</b>honour killings under &#8220;custom<b>.</b>&#8221;<b> Uniform legal interpretation of the provisions of this </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>article should be provided to ensure the highest penalty is always applied in cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>honour killings. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Turkey should enact comprehensive and specific legislation on hate crimes in 
accordance with international standards, in particular, articles 19 and 20 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>To reduce the vulnerable situation of LGBT individuals, Turkish legislation 
should be reviewed to include language sensitive to gender identity and sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>All complaints of violence and death threats should be promptly registered by 
the security officers, as well as fully and effectively investigated. Turkey should 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop a monitoring system on the registration and investigation of such complaints. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Where there is sufficient evidence of violations, the professionals of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be seized of the matter and should initiate criminal investigations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutions, irrespective of the willingness or ability of the victim to lodge or 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintain a complaint.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Turkey should prioritize improving the protection orders system. Protection 
orders should be issued promptly and enforced effectively. There should be a 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism to regularly monitor their functioning.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Security officers and the professionals of the judiciary should be investigated 
and held accountable systematically in cases of failure of due diligence and inaction 
</b></p>
<p><b>with regard to the registration of complaints as well as the issuance and enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>of protection orders.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Awareness-raising campaigns as well as training of security officials and 
professionals of the judiciary should continue with regard to the rights of women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender equality, and should be launched on the rights of LGBT individuals. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>An independent body which enjoys wide public support and representation 
should be established to investigate political killings that are unaccounted for and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>make recommendations regarding possible prosecution and other measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote transitional justice and a culture of accountability. The process of 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing such a body and determining its mandate should be open, transparent 
</b></p>
<p><b>and inclusive. Allegations regarding mass graves and violations that occurred in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>1990s should be considered as falling within the remit of the institution.  
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>An independent and urgent forensic investigation into identified mass graves in 
south-east Turkey and other relevant parts of the country should be conducted in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the Minnesota Protocol. Families should be thoroughly involved in 
</b></p>
<p>this process and have access to victims&#8217; remains. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The statute of limitations should be removed at least for all violations of the 
right to life. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Crime scene investigation procedure should be improved and monitored so that 
violations by State actors are investigated independently without the bias of colleagues 
</b></p>
<p><b>or delay in official reporting. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Forensic Medicine Institute should be provided with institutional 
independence, as well as with an increased capacity to conduct forensic and autopsy 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures in a swift, effective, impartial and transparent manner. Parties to a legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceeding should be able to present alternate evidence reviews. The possibility of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>presenting forensic reports performed by institutions that are not Government-
</b></p>
<p><b>affiliated should be fully ensured and facilitated. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>In cases of unlawful killing, the prosecutor should always bring charges for 
killing and never for a lesser crime instead.  
</b></p>
<p>121. &#8220;Unjust provocation&#8221; should not be misused as a mitigating factor in cases<b> 
which involve alleged morality motives as a cause of killing, in particular in cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>honour killings and killing of LGBT individuals</b>. &#8220;Good conduct&#8221; during legal 
</p>
<p><b>proceedings should also not be used to reduce the sentences in such cases.  
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>Positive developments introduced by the Third Judicial Reform Package should 
be implemented without delay to address the problem of lengthy judicial proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>If it is indeed correct to say that law enforcement officials may be tried without 
administrative authorization, the Government should make this fact more widely 
</b></p>
<p><b>known and prosecutors should immediately cease the practice of continuing to require 
</b></p>
<p><b>such authorization. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>When a public official is the subject of investigation of a violation of the right to 
life, he or she should not be allowed to remain on active duty and should not receive 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>Care should be taken to ensure that the Law Enforcement Oversight 
Commission envisaged by the current draft law has organizational and not merely 
</b></p>
<p><b>functional independence, including independence from the Government.  A similar 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring mechanism should be established to examine complaints regarding all acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Turkish Armed Forces, as well as the military duties of the Gendarmerie. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>Steps should be taken to reverse and stop the trend of reprisals against those 
who lodge complaints. Investigation and accountability should be ensured for all cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>of threats and coercion against witnesses, families, lawyers and non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. The practice of counter-charges should be ceased when it is used 
</b></p>
<p><b>selectively against those who bring complaints.  
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>A stronger and effectively implemented protection programme should be 
prioritized to provide witnesses, victims and their families, and other parties that feel 
</b></p>
<p><b>threatened with a safe haven. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Role of human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>The independence of the THRI should be fully ensured in law and in practice. 
The legal framework for the THRI should be reviewed to assess the level of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>conformity with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles), and be aligned thereto. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of a

<p><b>reference to the THRI in the Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>Turkey should consider amendments to the Law on the Ombudsman Institution 
to enable it to examine violations committed in all instances by the Turkish Armed

</b></p>
<p>130. <b>Turkey should consider ratifying the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute.

Turkey should envisage engaging with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of

<p><b>truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence.

<p>132. <b>Turkey should also prioritize follow-up on the recommendations of the United
