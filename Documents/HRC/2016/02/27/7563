</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression undertook an official visit to the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia from 18 to 21 June 2013. Despite the existence of a national legal framework 
with regard to the right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is mostly in line with 
international standards, and having achieved some progress, such as the decriminalization 
of defamation, a number of recent events indicate a worrying deterioration of the space for 
freedom of expression, in particular a narrowing of the space for pluralism and 
independence in the national media.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur was especially concerned by the information he received on 
recent cases of alleged intimidation by the authorities, through multiple legal procedures, of 
media and journalists critical of them. The worrying indicators include the closure of 
important media enterprises ordered by the authorities and the arbitrary detention of an 
investigative journalist. The Special Rapporteur was also seriously concerned by 
allegations regarding interference by government authorities with the independence of 
regulatory bodies and the judicial system. He was further concerned by the level of 
polarization between media groups and journalists sympathetic to the Government and

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b>1. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, undertook an official mission to the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from 18 to 21 June 2013, at the invitation of the 
Government. The visit was carried out pursuant to his mandate to assess compliance with 
international standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met a number of government officials, 
including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nikola Poposki, the Minister of Justice, Blerim 
Bexheti, the Minister of the Interior, Gordana Jankulovska and the Minister of the 
Information Society and Public Administration, Ivo Ivanovski. He also met the President of 
the Parliament, Trajko Veljanovski, the President of the Supreme Court, Lidija 
Nedelkovska, the President of the Constitutional Court, Branko Naumoski and the Public 
Prosecutor, Marko Zvrlevski, the President of the Broadcasting Council, Zoran Trajcevski, 
and the Ombudsman, Ixhet Memeti. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met representatives of civil society, including human 
rights organizations, journalists&#8217; associations and academia. He also met a number of 
journalists who were facing defamation charges.  
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government for its invitation 
to visit the country and for the support he received before and during his visit. Nevertheless, 
he expresses his disappointment that, despite repeated requests, he was unable to meet with 
the journalist Tomislav Kezarovski, who was in detention during the period of his visit.  
5. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank the United Nations country team in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in particular the human rights adviser, for 
facilitating all his activities during this visit. Finally, he would like to express his 
appreciation for the invaluable contribution by civil society representatives, in particular 
activists and journalists who shared their personal experiences. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International legal standards 
</b>6. In carrying out his assessment of the situation regarding the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Special 
Rapporteur is guided by the relevant international legal standards. In this case, the most 
pertinent treaties are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was 
ratified by the country on 18 January 1994 and, at the regional level, the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European 
Convention on Human Rights), ratified on 10 April 1997.  
7. The Special Rapporteur is guided by article 19 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights on 
freedom of expression. He is also guided by other relevant declarations, resolutions and 
guidelines of various United Nations bodies, including general comment No. 34 of the 
Human Rights Committee (2011) on article 19: freedoms of opinion and expression; 
resolutions 16/4 and 21/12 of the Human Rights Council; and the Siracusa Principles on the 
Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework 
</b>8. In line with international standards, the Constitution of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia guarantees the right to freedom of opinion and expression as a 
fundamental human right. Article 16 provides that: &#8220;the freedom of personal conviction, 
conscience, thought and public expression of thought is guaranteed. The freedom of speech, 
public address, public information and the establishment of institutions for public 
information is guaranteed. Free access to information and the freedom of reception and 
transmission of information are guaranteed. The right of reply via the mass media is 
guaranteed. The right to a correction in the mass media is guaranteed. The right to protect a 
source of information in the mass media is guaranteed. Censorship is prohibited.&#8221;1  
</p>
<p>9. In article 118, the Constitution further establishes that international treaties ratified 
by the country are part of the internal legal order of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia and may not be amended by law or another act. Article 98 provides that courts 
can rule on the basis of the Constitution and laws and international agreements ratified by 
the country. 
</p>
<p>10. Other particularly relevant national legal instruments include: the Criminal Code, 
which, inter alia, prohibits coercion aimed at changing someone&#8217;s position and belief; the 
Law on Electronic Communications, regulating the electronic communications sector; the 
Law on Broadcasting Activity, which governs the transmission of radio and television 
programmes; and the Law on Free Access to Public Information, which establishes the 
conditions and procedures for accessing public information held by State authorities.  
</p>
<p>11. In November 2012, parliament adopted the Law on Civil Liability for Defamation 
and Libel and removed sanctions for defamation from the Criminal Code. At the time of the 
visit, the Ministry of the Information Society and Public Administration was developing the 
recently presented draft law on the media, which was amended after consultations and 
adopted in December 2013 in the form of two laws: the Law on the Media and the Law on 
Audio and Audiovisual Media Services. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General overview 
</b></p>
<p>12. The full realization of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is commonly 
understood as a core requirement for the promotion of democratic governance. The free and 
safe flow of critical ideas and a well-functioning independent press are vital elements in the 
promotion of transparency and accountability. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes 
with appreciation that the national legal framework of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, starting with the Constitution, fully recognizes the centrality of the protection 
of this fundamental human right. Equally, the national authorities he met throughout the 
visit reaffirmed their view of the importance of ensuring that the utmost attention is paid to 
freedom of opinion and expression in the consolidation of democracy in the country.  
</p>
<p>13. At the international level, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has 
reaffirmed its willingness to enhance the protection of the right to freedom of expression on 
a number of different occasions. It accepted two recommendations to take measures to 
ensure the independence of the press during the first examination of the country in the

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>framework of the universal periodical review in 2009 (A/HRC/12/15, recommendations 35 
and 39). The high-level dialogue with the European Union on accession, launched in March 
2012, included freedom of expression and independence of the media as one of its five 
priority areas, establishing goals in terms of law and policy improvements. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur notes that some important progress has been achieved,<b> </b>welcoming, 
for example,<b> </b>the decriminalization of defamation in November 2012. However, he 
emphasizes that there is a concrete need for further improvement, particularly in the 
translation of national norms into reality. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur was especially concerned by the information he received 
about recent cases of alleged intimidation by the authorities, through multiple legal 
procedures, of media and journalists critical of them. The worrying indicators include the 
repeated implementation of disproportional restrictions against media enterprises and 
professionals in a relatively short space of time, including ordering the closing down of 
some of the most important private television channels and newspapers and the arbitrary 
detention of an investigative journalist. The adoption of excessive penalties, particularly 
against segments of the media critical of the authorities, has a negative impact which goes 
far beyond the direct damage to the media groups or journalists who are silenced. Extreme 
measures like this undermine the pluralism of the media and generate a widespread chilling 
effect which may seriously undermine the impact of all legislative progress in the area of 
freedom of expression. In this sense, the Special Rapporteur was also seriously concerned 
by allegations he heard regarding the interference by government authorities in the 
independence of regulatory bodies and of the judicial system, which are in turn 
implementing some worrying decisions. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur was also concerned by the level of polarization between 
media groups and journalists sympathetic to the Government and those taking a more 
critical position. In some situations, journalists&#8217; associations and civil society were very 
sceptical about the possibilities of establishing a constructive dialogue with the authorities 
in charge of designing and implementing regulations governing public and private media.  
</p>
<p>16. Since peacefully seceding from the Yugoslav Federation in 1991, the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has experienced ethnic tensions on several occasions, 
culminating in 2001 in a conflict between Albanian rebels and Macedonian police and 
armed forces. Those tensions resurface occasionally in the political discourse and in the 
work of the media.  
</p>
<p>17. While noting with appreciation that the Government has engaged in initiatives 
supporting the promotion of cultural diversity in the media, the Special Rapporteur was 
disturbed by reports of the emergence of expressions of hate and incitement to 
discrimination on the grounds of gender, nationality, religion and sexual orientation in the 
media and on the Internet. In particular, he noted a lack of attention paid to discrimination 
on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p>18. The subsections below detail further the main issues discussed during the visit, 
including concerns and the positive steps taken.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Freedom and independence of the media 
</b>19. As already indicated, the overall national legal framework protecting the right to 
freedom of expression and regulating the activity of the media in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia is mostly in line with relevant international human rights standards. 
Moreover, efforts continue to be made to bring national norms further into compliance with 
international standards and in particular with European standards. Despite this, the Special 
Rapporteur underlines his serious concern regarding the uneven enforcement of existing 
norms and its direct impact on the pluralism and independence of the Macedonian media. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>Over the last four years, at least seven important media outlets, including the oldest private 
television channel operating in the country and one of the most read political weekly 
magazines, were obliged to terminate their activities. In this context, the reported 
proliferation of judicial measures taken against certain media enterprises at the request of 
the Government and the regulatory authorities; the allegations of interference by the 
Government in the functioning of the regulatory body; the allegations of unfair allocation of 
State publicity resources favouring media groups aligned with the Government; and 
allegations of pressure being exercised against unionized journalists are all worrying 
indicators of the diminishing space for a plural and independent media in the country.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Judicial action against media enterprises and journalists  
</b>20. Civil society and international observers have reported increasing concerns 
regarding the imposition of disproportional penalties against media groups and 
professionals regarded as critical of the ruling authorities. The financial difficulties 
generated by judicial measures taken against media groups and journalists have resulted in 
the termination, or significant reduction, of activities of important groups, consequently 
limiting the pluralism of opinions in the mainstream media operating in the country.  
</p>
<p>21. The main indicator illustrating the concerns regarding the judicial harassment of 
independent media is the cessation of activities of a major broadcaster (A1 TV and its sister 
company, A2 TV) and of three daily newspapers (<i>Vreme</i>, <i>Koha e Re</i> and <i>Spic</i>) in July 2011. 
A1 was the oldest private television channel in activity in the country and <i>Vreme</i> one of the 
most read newspapers. The companies were closed as a consequence of a tax fraud and 
money laundering lawsuit brought against Velija Ramkovski, the owner of Plus Produkcija 
media group<i>,</i> the company which owned A1 and <i>Vreme</i>. In December 2010, Mr. 
Ramkovski, his daughter and 17 other persons employed by or collaborating with Plus 
Produkcija were arrested in a massive police operation criticized by civil society as 
disproportional and abusive. Despite the fact that the company had allegedly paid its initial 
debts, allowing A1 TV to continue operating, an additional demand for over 9 million euros 
was imposed on the group, to be paid in less than one month. The Public Revenue Office 
froze the assets of the group to guarantee enforcement of the financial penalties, which 
were extremely high considering the financial capacity of the media market in the country. 
Attempts to organize staggered payments were rejected. As a consequence, newspapers 
belonging to the group stopped circulating in July 2011 and A1 TV had its frequency 
revoked following a declaration of bankruptcy.  
</p>
<p>22. Without venturing any opinion on the merits of the accusation of tax evasion and 
money laundering, the Special Rapporteur was particularly disturbed by the refusal of the 
judicial and fiscal authorities to identify or adopt any sort of alternative solution, which 
could have prevented the simultaneous closure of so many media entities. He fully shares 
the concerns voiced by the Representative on freedom of the media of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with regard to the lack of proportionality in 
the penalties imposed against A1 TV and the newspapers. He also shares her conclusions 
regarding the impact of these closures on the elimination of pluralism in the media.2  
</p>
<p>23. In June 2012, another enterprise belonging to the same media group was targeted 
once again by a disproportional penalty when the Broadcasting Council revoked the licence 
of A2 TV, based on articles 63 and 64 of the Law on Broadcasting Activity, for allegedly 
failing to meet the licence criteria for its programming format by dedicating more than 65 
per cent of its airtime to entertainment programming, thereby providing insufficient 
educational and news programming. A2 TV had been affected financially by the penalties 
applied to the Plus Produkcija group the previous year, but demonstrated its intention to

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>comply with the format requirement. Again, as stated by the OSCE Representative on 
freedom of the media, the decision of the Broadcasting Council was clearly disproportional 
and reinforced concerns regarding its independence.3 
</p>
<p>24. The harsh measures adopted against the Plus Produkcija group contributed to 
intensifying the perception of an increasing politicization of the media, with most of the 
mainstream groups tending to favour the views of the Government. It was brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur that the owner of A1 TV was considered to be 
supportive of the ruling leadership until 2009. In 2010, the group allegedly adopted a more 
critical tone, which coincided with the beginning of the drastic judicial initiatives taken 
against it. The polarization appears to have continued, affecting the quality of the work of 
the media. During local elections in March 2013, for example, external observers reported a 
lack of balanced coverage by several broadcasters, including the public service 
broadcaster.4 
</p>
<p>25. Despite this difficult environment, the Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation 
the adoption by the Parliament of the new civil law regulating defamation and the 
consequent elimination of sanctions for defamation from the Criminal Code. In his opinion, 
the use of criminal law for claims of defamation is disproportional and can easily generate a 
chilling effect, which can undermine the independence of the media. That legal reform was 
one of the targets agreed through the high-level dialogue with the European Union on 
accession.  
</p>
<p>26. Some of the actions implemented to raise the awareness of judges of international 
standards concerning the right to freedom of opinion and expression are equally positive, 
including the translation and dissemination of the pertinent jurisprudence of the European 
Court of Human Rights. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the sensitization of the 
judicial authorities to international human rights standards should receive continued 
attention. 
</p>
<p>27. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern the information received 
from various sources that, even after the decriminalization of defamation, accusations of 
defamation were still made relatively frequently, particularly against the investigative 
segments of the media covering corruption and abuse by State authorities. By April 2013, 
for example, 60 lawsuits relating to defamation had reportedly already been opened.5  
</p>
<p>28. It is clear that independent journalists or media outlets cannot survive an onslaught 
of civil claims or demands. The fines prescribed by the new Law on Civil Liability for 
Defamation and Libel appear to be excessively high, considering the average salaries of 
journalists in the country and the economic capacity of some independent media groups. 
Concerns also exist with regard to the delay in the conclusion of multiple defamation 
procedures, possibly triggered by a single case, and the potentially high costs these might 
generate.  
</p>
<p>29. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed of many claims of defamation 
against <i>Fokus Magazine</i>, a weekly known for its investigative work. The financial 
instability generated by the continued legal targeting effectively undermined the operational 
capacity of this important magazine. In particular, he received information on accusations 
of defamation after an article was published in the magazine quoting a statement made by a

</p>
<p>former ambassador of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Czech Republic 
concerning corruption among public officials.  
</p>
<p>30. On 27 December 2013, <i>Fokus Magazine</i>, its editor and a journalist were all 
condemned for publishing that statement. They were ordered to pay damages in an amount 
which threatened to close the magazine. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at 
the additional negative impact of this decision on the work of <i>Fokus Magazine</i> and 
considers it completely inappropriate for the courts to even consider claims of defamation 
regarding the factual reporting of declarations by State officials or other third parties. The 
importance of the further efforts required to revise such practices in the courts and raise 
awareness within the judiciary is clear in this case. 
31. Still with regard to <i>Focus Magazine</i>, the Special Rapporteur was concerned by the 
lack of attention paid by the authorities to the death of its editor-in-chief and founder, 
Nikola Mladenov, in a car accident in March 2013. As multiple interlocutors, including 
persons working closely with Mr. Mladenov, indicated their suspicions that he had been 
murdered, the Special Rapporteur asked the competent authorities why they had not 
initiated a criminal inquiry into the causes of the accident and the death of Mr. Mladenov. 
The response of the authorities was that they had no evidence to justify treating the case 
differently from any other road accident in the country. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes 
that it is very important to ensure that full attention is paid to all episodes of alleged 
violence against journalists.  
32. The detention and conviction of the investigative journalist Tomislav Kezarovski is 
another recent example of the intimidation of investigative media professionals through 
judicial action in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In October 2013, a court of 
first instance convicted Mr. Kezarovski and sentenced him to four and a half years&#8217; 
imprisonment for revealing the identity of a protected witness in a murder case in an article 
published in 2008. The journalist was arrested in May 2013 and kept in detention for six 
months, including during the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, without clear 
judicial explanation, despite the protests of civil society and calls for his release by 
international human rights experts. He was transferred to house arrest in November 2013, 
while he appealed against his conviction.  
</p>
<p>33. The sentence of four and a half years&#8217; imprisonment for disclosing the identity of a 
witness in a news article, published two years before the determination of the protected 
status of that witness, seems to be unfair and clearly disproportionate. Moreover, civil 
society organizations have claimed that Mr. Kezarovski&#8217;s revelation served the public 
interest, as it was relevant to denouncing abuse by the police. The Special Rapporteur 
requested a meeting with the journalist during his visit and deeply regrets that the judicial 
authorities refused to allow him access. He publicly joined with the OSCE Representative 
on freedom of the media in her call for Mr. Kezarovski&#8217;s release and continues to believe 
that his sentencing is unfair and negatively affects the enjoyment of the freedom of the 
media in the country. Such extreme punishment of an investigative journalist generates a 
troubling effect that certainly affects all journalists in the country. 
</p><p>34. The negative impact of the successively contested judicial and regulatory decisions 
on the pluralism of the media indicates the need for a careful review of the work and 
functioning of the judiciary and of the regulatory bodies. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur was further concerned by the allegations he received regarding the interference 
of governmental authorities with the independence of judges and lawyers. The recent 
appointment of five members of the Constitutional Court, for example, is alleged to have 
directly affected the independence of this body, which has started to delay and compromise 
on decisions, including in recent cases related to the right to freedom of expression. 
Furthermore, the Constitutional Court does not have the administrative and financial 
autonomy to perform its work with the required independence. All human rights are at great 
risk without the protection of a fully independent judicial system. The Special Rapporteur </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>therefore emphasizes that urgent responses are needed to identify carefully and eliminate all 
possible avenues of interference in the work of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p><i> (<b></b></i><b>b) Independence of the regulatory body and of the public broadcaster</b> 35. In the terms of article 21 of the Law on Broadcasting Activity the Broadcasting 
Council is an independent regulatory body with oversight responsibilities for broadcasting 
activity. The tasks of the Council include deciding on the allocation, revocation and 
renewal of broadcasting licences, supervising compliance with the Law and adopting legal 
measures against those failing to comply (art. 37). The neutrality and independence of this 
regulatory body is central to ensuring success in its task of ensuring pluralism of 
expression, the existence of diverse and independent media and protecting the interests of 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>36. In this regard, serious concern was expressed over the revision by the Government 
of the regulation regarding the composition of the Broadcasting Council, approved by 
parliament in July 2011. The number of members of the Council was expanded from 9 to 
15, with the additional 6 members to be nominated by State institutions controlled by the 
governing coalition. The independence of the Council, given its new composition, was 
widely questioned, for example, when it recommended revoking the licence of A2 TV for 
failing to air a minimal amount of news and educational programming (see para. 24 above). 
This was considered a disproportional punishment of a media group which had already 
been affected by previous legal procedures. 
</p>
<p>37. As detailed in recommendation Rec(2000)23 of the Council of Europe Committee of 
Ministers to member States on the independence and functions of regulatory authorities for 
the broadcasting sector, rules regarding membership of such bodies should be defined so as 
to protect them against any interference, in particular by political forces or economic 
interests. In this regard, the sudden shift in the selection of members of the Broadcasting 
Council should at least have been more carefully evaluated.  
</p>
<p>38. A totally new regulatory framework is being established following the adoption of 
the new Law on the Media on 25 December 2013. As described below, the original drafts 
of this law caused great concern among civil society and the international community, 
given its imprecise language and excessive scope for regulation. The revised law still 
stipulates the establishment of a new &#8220;media agency&#8221;. The independence of this new body 
is going to be central to ensuring its legitimacy.  
</p>
<p>39. Questions were also raised with regard to the administrative and financial 
independence of the public broadcasting service, Macedonian Radio Television. In July 
2011, the executive committee of Macedonian Radio Television decided to dismiss all 
seven directors of the board simultaneously, although only two were nearing the end of 
their term of office. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recalls that States should also 
guarantee the full independence and editorial freedom of public broadcasting services. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Transparency in the allocation of State publicity  
</b>40. The allocation of State resources to advertisements was indicated as another matter 
of concern. The Government is an important purchaser of publicity and representatives of 
civil society underlined the lack of transparency in the allocation of State resources among 
media groups and the potential bias in resource allocation favouring sympathetic 
enterprises.6

</p>
<p>41. The combination of the financial risk experienced by media which are critical of the 
authorities and often targeted by lawsuits, and the disadvantage they are at in terms of 
access to State advertising seems to be gradually restricting the plurality of opinion in the 
media landscape in favour of media aligned with the Government. As the Human Rights 
Committee indicated in its general comment No. 34, care must be taken to ensure that 
systems of government subsidy to media outlets and the placing of government 
advertisements are not employed to the effect of impeding freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(d) Tensions with journalists&#8217; unions 
</b>42. Associations representing journalists in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
are very polarized. In their meetings with the Special Rapporteur, representatives of the 
Association of Journalists of Macedonia, established in 1946, and of the Independent Trade 
Union of Journalists, established in 2011, on one side, and of the Macedonian Association 
of Journalists, established in 2002, on the other, presented very different views with regard 
to the challenges experienced by journalists and the media. 
43. Representatives of the Association of Journalists and of the Independent Trade 
Union reported multiple concerns with regard to the diminishing pluralism in the media, the 
selective enforcement of legislation against journalists critical of the authorities and the 
undue pressure exercised by media owners against members of that organization, possibly 
influenced by governmental pressure. Representatives of the Macedonian Association of 
Journalists criticized the work of the other unions and civil society entities, noting their 
politicization. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur noted with particular concern a report concerning the 
dismissal from Alsat TV of Tamara Causidis, president of the Independent Trade Union of 
Journalists, from her functions in August 2011. Her dismissal appears to have violated the 
law prohibiting companies from firing union leaders. Reportedly, she was asked by her 
supervisors to reduce her union-related activities. A month after concluding his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur was also informed of allegations regarding pressure being recently put 
on media professionals working in the cities of Bitola, Ko&#269;ani and &#352;tip by owners of media 
groups to sign applications to join the Macedonian Association of Journalists. 
</p><p>45. Tensions between the Government, opposition political parties and civil society 
representatives, including representatives of journalists&#8217; unions, reached a peak after 24 
December 2012, when opposition politicians and journalists were expelled from the floor of 
the national parliament during the voting on the budget for 2013. Journalists reported being 
forcibly removed from the parliament chamber on the order of the President of the 
legislature, prior to the violent expulsion of all opposition representatives who were 
opposing the adoption of the budget. Those confrontations paralysed political debate in 
parliament for almost three months and also disrupted the process of dialogue on the media 
launched in the context of the high-level dialogue with the European Union on accession. In 
August 2013, a political ad hoc inquiry commission found that the expulsion of journalists 
and opposition politicians had been in violation of the Constitution and the law. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(e) Adoption of new regulatory instruments  
</b>46. In April 2013, the proposal put forward by the Government for a law on media and 
audiovisual services caught the attention of the national and international human rights 
community. The original draft was widely criticized for its complexity, unrealistic ambition 
of defining the profession of journalism and prescribing detailed standards for all mass 
media providing information to the public. It was also criticized for blurring distinctions 
between self-regulation and external oversight and for creating possible tools for arbitrary 
restrictions on freedom of expression. The Government listened to the criticisms and 
prepared three different versions of the original draft, in dialogue with international experts, 
including the Special Rapporteur and the Office of the Representative on the freedom of the 
media of OSCE. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts of the Minister of the Information 
Society and Public Administration to conduct consultations on the draft law with various 
national stakeholders and international experts in order to ensure its adequacy with regard 
to international standards. It was recognized that some progress had been achieved as a 
result of the dialogue between national authorities and international experts. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur was not able to complete an analysis of the new legal 
instruments before the finalization of the present report and he intends to continue 
following this issue, given its central relevance for the promotion and protection of the 
independence of the media in the country. Nevertheless, he underlines the importance of 
ensuring that the new legal framework is implemented in an inclusive manner, in particular 
considering the very marked polarization between the Government and some sectors of the 
media and civil society. He also notes that attention must be paid to ensuring the voluntary 
nature of all initiatives on self-regulation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to access information 
</b></p>
<p>49. Free access to information is guaranteed in the Constitution by article 16 on freedom 
of opinion and expression. Since 2006, the country has also had a Law on Free Access to 
Public Information which, inter alia, details the procedures for implementation of the right 
to free access to information in the country and established the Commission for Protection 
of the Right to Free Access, mandated to oversee the implementation of the law. The law 
allows any natural or legal person to obtain information from national and municipal 
bodies. Requests for information can be made in oral, written or electronic form. The 
authorities should respond within a 30-day period. 
</p>
<p>50. Over seven years after the adoption of the Law on Free Access to Public 
Information, some progress was noted in the responses of the authorities to requests for 
information and in the proactive display of public information. However, limitations are 
still to be noted in the implementation of the Law.  
</p>
<p>51. The Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access does not provide 
comprehensive statistical data on issues such as the total number of requests for information 
received. Civil society criticized the lack of recommendations in the report of the 
Commission in 2012 on important topics, such as the large number of cases for which 
&#8220;administrative silence&#8221; prevented access to information.7  
</p>
<p>52. The European Commission considered that enforcement of the Law on Free Access 
to Public Information was inefficient and called for the Commission for Protection of the 
Right to Free Access to be better resourced.8 It further reported that one third of holders of 
information failed to submit their annual reports to the Commission for Protection of the 
Right to Free Access, penalties were not imposed in practice and political parties were 
excluded from the obligation to provide information to the public.  
</p>
<p>53. The Macedonian Young Lawyers Association assessed the responsiveness of the 
authorities to requests for information in 2012: it submitted 145 requests for free access to 
information to a number of State institutions and noted that two thirds of the information 
holders responded within the time limit of 30 days and delivered the requested information. 
However, it also noted that some institutions never responded to its requests and some 
simply redirected the demand to other institutions without providing any explanation.9

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>54. In 2013, an extensive study on views and perceptions of the right to free access to 
information was conducted.10 Survey results indicated that a significant proportion of 
citizens still did not believe that they enjoyed the right to request information from public 
and State institutions.<b> </b>Despite the law, one quarter of the surveyed group would still resort 
to connections and friends in order to obtain the information needed. The study also 
indicated that the majority of bodies holding information had implemented certain activities 
to align their practices with the Law, but 25 per cent of the surveyed sample had not taken 
any specific initiative in that regard<b>.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that protection of the right to access information 
should receive dedicated attention on a permanent basis, given its central importance for the 
promotion of democratic governance. As indicated in his previous report to the General 
Assembly (A/68/362), the adoption of national laws on access to information is a very 
positive step, but should be understood as a first step: full implementation requires political 
will, with full endorsement by various relevant authorities of the principles enshrined in the 
new normative framework; an active civil society advocating for and monitoring 
implementation of those norms; and overall respect for the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>56. In this sense, despite recognizing advances, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
capacity of government officials to respond to requests for information can be enhanced 
through regular training and technical support. Investment is also necessary to raise 
awareness of the procedures for exercising the right to information. Finally, the annual 
reports presented by the Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access should 
contain more detailed information, including disaggregated data, on the requests for 
information made to multiple State entities, to enable a better assessment of their 
compliance with the law.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Use of the Internet as an alternative media 
</b>57. In 2012, the International Telecommunication Union estimated that the Internet was 
accessible to 51.5 per cent of the population.11 Policies promoting broadband access and 
universal services were considered successful, as the number of households owning a 
computer had doubled between 2006 and 2011 and virtually all of them had also acquired 
broadband connections.12 The digital switchover is under way in the country. In 2012, the 
Law on Electronic Communications was amended, fixing 1 June, 2013 as the date for 
analogue switch-off.  
</p>
<p>58. Estimates further indicate that approximately one third of the population is active on 
social networks, particularly the younger age groups and the Macedonian-speaking 
population.13 Recently, social media has functioned as an important instrument for political 
activism: for example, during the elections in 2011, the death of a young activist at the 
hands of the police precipitated street protests and online campaigns against police brutality 
organized through social networks.  
</p>
<p>59. However, television remains the dominant media channel in the country, often 
providing a politicized coverage tending to be supportive of the Government. On the other 
hand, the rise of the Internet as a source for broadcasting news appears to have expanded 
the range and scope of voices in the media. Journalists whose work was affected by the 
recent closure of traditional media have considered migrating to the virtual space.

</b></p>
<p>60. As much as the Internet offers an important space for independent voices not 
represented in the mainstream media, the capacity of alternative news portals is still small, 
owing to their limited financial and professional resources. The political and ethnic 
polarization has also occasionally undermined the use of the Internet, with instances of hate 
speech appearing online. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Privacy in communications 
</b></p>
<p>61. The rights to privacy, data protection and secrecy of communications are enshrined 
in the Constitution. Privacy of communications is expressly guaranteed in article 17: &#8220;The 
freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and other forms of communication is 
guaranteed. Only a court decision may authorize non-application of the principle of the 
inviolability of the confidentiality of correspondence and other forms of communication, in 
cases where it is indispensable to a criminal investigation or required in the interests of the 
defence of the Republic.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>62. The Law on Electronic Communications further established the obligation for 
operators of telecommunications networks and the providers of public telecommunications 
services to ensure confidentiality in communications to the best of their technical abilities.  
</p>
<p>63. Despite these clear protections of the right to privacy, additional norms and legal 
reforms have recently expanded the scope of surveillance of communications without 
establishing adequate protections and oversight.  
</p>
<p>64. In 2010, the Ministry of Transport and Communications proposed an amendment to 
the Law on Electronic Communications, establishing the obligation for telecommunications 
operators to provide direct and uninhibited access to traffic and other kinds of data to the 
Ministry of the Interior without prior notice or a court order. The amendment was adopted 
with strong support in parliament. Fortunately, some months after the adoption of this 
amendment. the Constitutional Court repealed the amendment following the submission of 
a petition by human rights organizations.  
</p>
<p>65. However, in 2012, another legal reform expanded the possibilities of surveillance of 
communications without adequate oversight: parliament unanimously amended the Law on 
Interception of Communications, expanding the capacity of State institutions to use 
surveillance technology. Under the amendments, any police officer, for example, may 
propose wiretapping over a period of four months (previously the limit was 30 days). The 
provision establishing that legal wiretapping may only be conducted within a specific 
period, calculated in accordance with the goals of the investigation, was removed from the 
new law.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur focused his previous annual report to the Human Rights 
Council (A/HRC/23/40 and Corr. 1) on the impact of the surveillance of communications 
by States on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and 
expression. In the present report, while noting the interdependence between the rights to 
privacy and to freedom of expression, he urges all States to revise their laws and practices 
with regard to surveillance, paying attention to the issue of judicial oversight. In this regard, 
he notes with concern the weakening of national norms regulating surveillance in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and reaffirms his call for a comprehensive review 
of all relevant national norms, in order to ensure protection of the right to privacy, in line 
with international human rights norms.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Respect for diversity  
</b></p>
<p>67. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia displays a rich cultural and linguistic 
diversity. The two most significant groups of the population are Macedonians, mostly 
Orthodox Christians, and Albanians, who are predominantly Muslim. The languages 
spoken in the country include Macedonian, Albanian, Romany, Turkish and Serbian. The 
Ohrid Framework Agreement, established by the leaders of the main parties following </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>violent clashes between the Macedonian Armed Forces and the ethnic Albanian National 
Liberation Army in 2001, provided various guarantees for the human rights of ethnic 
Albanians, including the use of Albanian as an official language in the country. The right to 
protection from discrimination is established in article 9 of the Constitution. In 2010, the 
Law on the Prevention of and Protection against Discrimination was also enacted. 
</p>
<p>68. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted with appreciation the measures taken 
to ensure the functioning of media services controlled by or serving cultural and linguistic 
minority groups in the country. For example, he was informed that small public grants are 
given to some minority media outlets, especially those broadcasting in Romany. 
Information was also received on the maintenance by the public service broadcasting 
network of a special channel for broadcasting programmes in the various languages spoken 
around the country, although expressions of concern were made regarding the 
disproportional predominance of Albanian language broadcasting.  
</p>
<p>69. The authorities should pay permanent attention to the protection of diversity in the 
media. As emphasized by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 34, 
States should take particular care to encourage an independent and diverse media as a 
means of protecting the right of media users, including members of ethnic and linguistic 
minorities, to receive a wide range of information and ideas.  
</p>
<p>70. Despite the progress made so far, the Special Rapporteur also noted with concern 
occurrences of hate speech and problems in the legislation addressing incitement of hatred. 
</p>
<p>71. The vague formulation of article 319 of the Criminal Code, which imposes sanctions 
for causing national, racial or religious hatred, discord or intolerance, is a source of 
potential abuse of the right to freedom of expression. After visiting the country in 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief urged the Government to review article 
319, given its imprecise wording and the consequent chilling effect it might have on the 
exercise of the freedoms of expression and of religion or belief (A/HRC/13/40/Add.2, para. 
48). In 2004, article 319 was allegedly misused against a religious leader sentenced for 
undermining the position of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, conducting a service of 
worship in a private flat and distributing a calendar that offended religious sentiments.  
</p>
<p>72. Despite the elimination of sanctions for defamation from the Criminal Code in 2012, 
the provisions of article 319 had not been amended. During the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur, the Ministry of Justice stated that it was debating the amendment of article 319 
in order to comply with recommendations made by human rights experts, including the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Amendment of this article was 
included in the Government proposal in November 2013 for amendments to the Criminal 
Code, which were adopted by parliament in February 2014. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur recalls that international human rights law recognizes that 
the right to freedom of expression can be restricted where it presents a serious danger for 
others and for their enjoyment of human rights. However, it is crucial that  any restrictions 
respect the following principles: (a) they must be provided for by law, which must be clear, 
unambiguous, precisely worded and accessible to everyone; (b) they must be proven by the 
State as necessary and legitimate to protect the rights or reputation of others, national 
security or public order and public health or morals; and (c) they must be proven by the 
State to be the least restrictive and proportionate means to achieve the purported aim 
(A/67/357, para. 41).  
</p><p>74. Hate speech in the media and on the Internet has surfaced as a concern, sometimes 
connected with the polarization between political groups aligned with ethnic and religious 
groups. Article 394 (d) of the Criminal Code established specific sanctions for 
discriminatory remarks on the Internet: &#8220;Any person who, through a computer system, is 
distributing racist and xenophobic written material, image or other representation of an idea 
or theory that advocates, promotes or incites hatred, discrimination or violence, against any </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>individual or group of individuals, based on race, colour, national or ethnic origin, as well 
as religious belief, shall be sentenced to imprisonment of one to five years.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>75. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is worried by information he has received 
about the lack of attention paid by the authorities to the emergence of direct and indirect 
attacks against sexual minorities in the country and by the use of homophobic language by 
some political figures and the media.  
</p>
<p>76. Despite efforts by civil society during the drafting process, the Law on the 
Prevention of and Protection against Discrimination does not contain explicit references to 
sexual orientation or gender identity among the prohibited grounds for discrimination. 
Article 394 (b) of the Criminal Code also lacks specific references. 
</p><p>77. The lack of specific protection for acts against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
activists is particularly worrying, considering recent attacks against representatives of that 
community. Activists protesting against discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender community were attacked during a march for the International Day of 
Tolerance in November 2012. In 2013, attacks in Bitola against LGBT United and the 
Coalition for the Sexual and Health Rights of Marginalized Communities were also 
reported. Over the same period, repeated attacks damaged the facilities of the support centre 
for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in the old bazaar of Skopje, to the 
extent that consideration was being given to moving the support centre to another location 
because of the insecurity. Those attacks were reported to the authorities by the victims, but 
the perpetrators were not identified. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the 
dissemination of discriminatory messages in the media, including by some leading 
broadcasters.  
</p>
<p>78. The increasing prevalence of expressions of hate, incitement to violence, 
discrimination and hostility in the mass media and on the Internet indicates the need for 
permanent attention to the fight against intolerance. In view of the recurrent hostility 
against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, the authorities should not 
only address better the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation 
through national norms, but should also consider paying particular attention to the 
enforcement of the law to prevent hate speech and violence and investing in non-legal 
measures, such as education and counter-speech, to encourage the abandonment of 
discriminatory stereotypes. Formal and open rejection of hate speech by high-level public 
officials, in particular hate messages targeting sexual minorities, would also play an 
important role in the struggle against intolerance and discrimination in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>79. <b>The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has repeatedly affirmed its 
commitment to ensuring the full realization of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. The relevant national legal framework is mostly in line with international 
standards. The authorities have also frequently engaged in open debates with 
international experts on the measures potentially needed to adjust national laws and 
policies so that they are closer to international norms concerning the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Nevertheless, the enforcement of national and international norms seems to be 
frequently problematic and a worrying trend of increasing confrontation between the 
authorities and the independent media has been noted in recent years. The Special 
Rapporteur is particularly worried by the multiple allegations he received regarding 
disproportional restrictions being imposed, mainly over the last three years, on 
independent or critical segments of the media.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Progress, such as the decriminalization of defamation, may be undermined if 
judicial cases carrying threats of heavy fines continue to be opened against the 
investigative press. Belief in the judicial and non-judicial oversight guarantees 
established in law can be undermined by sudden changes in the composition of courts 
or in the membership of regulatory bodies. The increasing polarization of the political 
debate aggravates this scenario and can negatively affect the constructive dialogue 
needed for the consolidation of democratic governance in the country.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Progress was noted in the promotion of access to information, in the expansion 
of Internet use and in the development of work in minority languages by the media. 
However, much more can and must be done in these areas as well. The right to access 
information is not commonly recognized by either officials or the overall population. 
The proliferation of discriminatory remarks and even attacks against the lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender community, for example, demands an urgent and vocal 
response from the authorities condemning this form of discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur proposes the following recommendations 
to the State.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ensure the adequate enforcement of norms protecting the freedom and 
independence of the media  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Permanent attention must be paid to the enforcement of norms regulating the 
work of the media and guaranteeing its freedom. All allegations regarding the 
arbitrary enforcement of disproportional penalties against media outlets and 
journalists need to be reviewed and potentially reversed, and reparation offered to the 
victims of arbitrary punishment.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b> The judicial authorities should be further trained to ensure that the Law on 
Civil Liability for Defamation and Libel is adequately implemented, in line with 
international standards and jurisprudence concerning the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression. The financial penalties prescribed in the law should be revised in the 
light of the economic reality of the country. State officials and the political leadership 
in general should refrain from the systematic submission of judicial complaints 
against investigative journalists and the media.  
</b>86. <b>The State should ensure the independence of national courts as a matter of 
priority. The appointment process for judges and for the membership of regulatory 
bodies should be carefully analysed and revised in the light of similar relevant 
international practices. The financial and technical autonomy of judicial bodies needs 
to be fully secured.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The State should ensure that any regulatory body established since the recent 
adoption of new regulations should have its membership and work protected against 
any interference, in particular by political forces or economic interests. Further 
efforts are required by the governmental authorities to ensure that a more fluid 
dialogue is maintained with civil society on the implementation of any regulatory 
initiative.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The independence of journalists&#8217; associations and the right of journalists to 
affiliate themselves with any association of their choice should be fully protected. 
Allegations of reprisals against journalists active in an association, or of any 
interference in the process of affiliation should be thoroughly investigated.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The financial and administrative independence of the public broadcaster must 
also be enhanced. Recent changes in the directorship of Macedonian Radio Television 
carried out by the executive committee should be revised in the light of the norms 
regulating the work of the public broadcaster. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Expenditure on advertising by State institutions, political parties and public 
enterprises should be fully transparent to the public. Systematic assessments must be 
carried out to ensure that government subsidies or expenditure on advertising do not 
favour specific media outlets or generate dependency.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Invest in the promotion of the right to access information 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>In order to enhance the implementation of the national norms protecting the 
right to access information, the capacity of the Commission for Protection of the Right 
to Free Access should be enhanced. The reports periodically prepared by the 
Commission should contain more detailed information, including disaggregated data 
on the requests made to multiple State entities, and provide specific recommendations 
to address non-compliance with the law. Further efforts are also necessary to ensure 
that State institutions have the capacity to respond in a timely fashion to requests for 
information. Further investment should also be made in raising public awareness of 
the law and the procedures for requesting information.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Revise legislation concerning the surveillance of communications  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Law on Interception of Communications should be revised in order to 
ensure that it conforms to national and international norms protecting the rights to 
privacy and to freedom of expression. Particular attention must be given to ensuring 
that the surveillance of private communications only occurs under the most 
exceptional circumstances and exclusively under the supervision of an independent 
judicial authority.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Ensure respect for diversity and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The linguistic and cultural plurality of the media should continue to be 
promoted, given its important role in the promotion of equal access to information 
and social integration.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The State should maintain proactive leadership in the fight against all forms of 
discrimination, ensuring not only the enforcement of national norms, but also the 
promotion of non-legal measures to prevent incitement of hatred. Enhanced attention 
is required to the recurrent hostilities against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender community. All episodes of violence and intimidation against 
representatives of the community must be carefully investigated so that perpetrators
