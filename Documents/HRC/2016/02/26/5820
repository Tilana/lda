strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, and in that regard calls 
upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, to continue to implement the

assure adequate human rights guarantees to ensure fair and clear procedures, in particular with 
regard to placing and removing individuals and entities from terrorism-related sanctions lists; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Stresses</i> the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and 
international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are participating in 
the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, that provide technical assistance related to </p>
