<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. A number of positive overtures have been made by the new Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, apparently aimed at advancing President Hassan Rouhani&#8217;s 
campaign pledges to strengthen human rights protections for civil, political, social, cultural 
and economic rights, and at remedying some cases of human rights violations. This 
includes the proposal of a new charter for citizens&#8217; rights. Since September 2013, the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has released 80 individuals, some of whom 
appear to have been prosecuted for peacefully exercising their fundamental rights to 
expression, belief, association or assembly.1 Some detainees were furloughed for a few 
days; others appear to have been permanently released, while hundreds of others remain in 
some form of confinement, including several individuals whose detention was identified as 
arbitrary by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (see annex I).2  
</p><p>2. The Special Rapporteur, while welcoming the above-mentioned positive steps, 
stresses that they currently do not address fully the fundamental human rights concerns 
raised by the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and its special procedures, the 
treaty bodies, human rights defenders and international organizations. This includes the 
need to address laws and practices that infringe upon the rights to life, to the freedoms of 
expression, association, assembly, belief and religion, to education and to non-
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the basis of these concerns is primarily the 
non-compliance of national laws with the State&#8217;s international obligations and a lack of 
adherence to the rule of law, as well as a failure to investigate complaints and to bring 
human rights violators to justice. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur believes that the 
recent engagement with the international community presents opportunities for future 
cooperation, particularly with regard to capacity-building to advance the State&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>4. Reports of the arbitrary detention of individuals for peacefully exercising their 
fundamental rights to expression, association, assembly, belief and religion remain 
prevalent. Interpreting article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the Human Rights Committee recognized, in a draft general comment on liberty and 
security of person, that &#8220;liberty of the person is a right of profound importance, both for its 
own sake and because deprivation of liberty has historically been a principal means by 
which other human rights are suppressed. 
</p>
<p>5. Information in the above-mentioned reports also reveal that aspects of Iranian laws, 
policies, attitudes and practices extensively identified by the United Nations human rights 
machinery regretfully continue without redress and persist in undermining the 
independence of the State&#8217;s judicial organs, and in nullifying safeguards for fair trials. This 
is all the more alarming when considering the frequent use of the death penalty, in 
particular for crimes not considered the &#8220;most serious offences&#8221; under international law.  
</p>
<p>6. The present report, far from being exhaustive, analyses the prospects for reform of 
the administration of justice, in particular with regard to progress made in implementing the

</p>
<p>2
 On 29 August 2012, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in its opinion No. 30/2012, found 
</p>
<p>that the detention of Mir Hossein Mossavi and Mehdi Karoubi was arbitrary (see 
A/HRC/WGAD/2012/30).  </p>


<p>recommendations made by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2003,3 during the 
universal periodic review in 20104 and by the Human Rights Committee in 2011.5  
</p>
<p>7. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran forwarded a detailed reply to all 
sections of the present report,6 in which it revealed its ongoing dissatisfaction with credible 
sources of information, contending that the report violated article 6 of the Code of Conduct 
for Special Procedures Mandate Holders, which directs them to pursue due diligence in 
gathering and corroborating information emanating from credible sources. The Government 
asserted that the present report selectively considered comments made by other United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, and questioned whether visiting a few European 
countries to collect information on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran was &#8220;the correct methodology for the compilation of a report&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>8. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur continues to maintain that he only presents 
corroborated information, gathered from credible sources, that he has sought clarification 
on a number of issues and cases through communications with the Government &#8211; a majority 
of which remain unanswered &#8211; and that he has accurately presented concerns raised by 
other human rights mechanisms. He also concurs that the alternatives pursued in the 
absence of an approved visit to the country are less than ideal. 
</p>
<p>9. In its comments, the Government also asserted that individuals that are guilty of 
serious crimes &#8211; including alleged acts of violence, the disruption of public order and the 
promotion of ideas with the intent of inciting &#8220;secessionist&#8221; activities &#8211; were 
inappropriately identified as human rights defenders in the report. It also maintained that 
journalists and lawyers are not immune from prosecution when they violate &#8220;the boundaries 
of a duty entrusted to him/her by law and engages in acts that run contrary to his/her 
standing&#8221;. Lastly, the Government continued to maintain that drug trafficking is a serious 
crime that warrants capital punishment.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology and activities 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur conducted interviews with a total of 72 Iranians in the 
Netherlands, Germany and France between 12 and 22 December 2013 (see annex II). 
Another 61 Iranians located in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey submitted 
statements between September and December 2013. These individuals identified 
themselves as human rights defenders, lawyers and persons belonging to ethnic and 
religious minority groups. Others identified themselves as former &#8220;political prisoners&#8221; or 
relatives of former or current &#8220;political prisoners&#8221;, including some who had been executed.  
</p>
<p>11. During the interviews, individuals recounted events spanning several decades, and 
answered a series of specific questions pertaining to their arrest, detention and prosecution, 
where relevant. Between1 August 2013 and 3 January 2014, the Special Rapporteur 
received written reports from human rights organizations on the situation of Baha&#8217;i, 
Gonabadi Dervish, Sunnis, Christian, religious minority communities and the Ahwazi Arab, 
Kurdish, Baluch and Azerbaijani ethnic minority groups. The information communicated 
during all 133 interviews and in the written submissions was examined and is contained in 
the annexes to the present report.

<p>12. The Special Rapporteur addressed 25 communications, including 8 allegation letters 
and 17 urgent actions, to the Government to enquire about specific cases and express 
concern about certain trends, including the arrest and prosecution of journalists, political 
and student activists, trade unionists, artists, human right defenders, lawyers and women 
rights activists; the situation of religious minorities; lack of access to medical care in 
prisons, the application of the death penalty, including the execution of persons in secret; 
and the promulgation of discriminatory legislation. The Government responded to four of 
these enquiries. On 19 July 2013, the Special Rapporteur also issued several detailed 
surveys in the form of questionnaires to various government offices for the purpose of 
gathering further information about the impact of economic sanctions on the country&#8217;s 
humanitarian situation, and transmitted two requests for a visit on 16 May and 2 July 2013, 
in order to strengthen cooperation with the Government and to investigate further the 
allegations submitted to him. The Government has yet to respond to these communications.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur met with the Permanent Representatives of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to the United Nations in Geneva and New York to discuss views on the 
conclusions drawn by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports, his methodology and 
the prospects for future engagement. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to future 
opportunities for engagement and cooperation, including through further meetings and by 
visiting the country.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legislative developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Draft charter of citizens&#8217; rights  
</b></p>
<p>14. On 26 November 2013, the Government announced the publication of its draft 
charter of citizens&#8217; rights, which was made available for public comment.7 According to the 
draft, the charter proposes no new rights, but recalls the most important rights currently 
guaranteed by Iranian law. It states that the charter serves as the Government&#8217;s intended 
&#8220;plan and policy&#8221;,8 and proposes a framework for cooperation between the various 
branches of Government to strengthen guarantees for civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>15. Human rights defenders and a number of human rights organizations contend that 
the current draft fails to address underlying concerns, emphasizing that it frames rights 
within the context of the current national legal framework, which has been a source of 
concern for the United Nations human rights machinery for decades.9 Articles 3.11 and 
3.16, for example, acknowledge the right to promote and disseminate ideas and opinions, 
regardless of medium, and highlight the rights to freedom of association and assembly 
&#8220;within the framework of the law&#8221;, as long as they do not violate public rights or the 
principles of Islam.

<p>16. The charter currently fails to address laws and policies that discriminate against 
religious minorities, including the Baha&#8217;i, and insufficiently addresses discrimination 
against women, including their ability to pass their citizenship on to their children. It also 
fails to address the use of cruel, inhumane or degrading punishment, including flogging, 
hanging, stoning and amputation; it does not ban the execution of juveniles; and it fails to 
address concerns about the use of capital punishment, in particular for offences that do not 
meet the standards for most serious crimes under international law. 
</p>
<p>17. Several organizations and human rights defenders also recall that a number of laws, 
including the Constitution and the 2004 Law on Respecting Legitimate Freedoms and 
Protecting Citizens&#8217; Rights, already guarantee the rights described in the charter, but that 
certain aspects of other laws and practices undermine their protection. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Criminal procedure law  
</b></p>
<p>18. On 6 November 2013, the Guardian Council approved a new criminal procedure 
law, which has yet to come into force. The new law incorporates the 2004 Law on 
Respecting Legitimate Freedoms and Protecting Citizens&#8217; Rights. From a rights 
perspective, the new law presents some notable improvements to the current law, which 
facilitated a variety of abuses. Nonetheless, the new law also maintains some key 
shortcomings.  
</p>
<p>19. The new law continues to provide for the detention of individuals throughout an 
initial investigation phase, during which security officials gather evidence against suspects. 
It requires the authorities to adhere to procedures designed to safeguard fair trial standards 
defined in the law of 2004.10 In order to prevent flight or to maintain &#8220;pubic order&#8221;, the law 
allows investigatory judges to extend pretrial detention, once charges have been laid within 
24 hours, for serious offences, including for vaguely worded national security offences, for 
one month at a time and for up to two years or until trial.11 Detainees may appeal against 
the extension of detention within 10 days of its issuance.  
</p>
<p>20. The new law allows the access of defendants to a lawyer within the initial 
investigation phase, upon their request.12 Under the current criminal procedure, lawyers are 
prohibited access during the initial investigation. Furthermore, the investigatory judge must 
inform the accused of the right to a lawyer, and offer a court-appointed lawyer if the 
accused cannot afford one.13 When accused persons are charged with a national security or 
other serious offence, however, they can still be denied the right to counsel for one week. 
Security forces, with the agreement of an investigatory judge, may also deny a detainee&#8217;s 
communication with family and friends if there is &#8220;a need to do so&#8221;, which is not clearly 
defined.14  
</p>
<p>21. The law also expands the number of judges that preside over serious crimes in 
public criminal and revolutionary courts to five, with a quorum of three. In addition, the 
law expanded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear appeals, including claims that 
serious procedural violations have invalidated verdicts. The law states, however, that

<p>procedural violations do not themselves invalidate rulings unless rights breached are of 
sufficient importance.15 
</p>
<p>22. Defendants may, if acquitted, seek remedy for defamation, damages and mental 
anguish to themselves or family members if they have been unjustifiably detained or 
detained through a mistake or fault of the judge during the initial investigation period. Such 
claims are to be heard by a provisional commission, which consists of three judges 
appointed by the head of the judiciary.16 
</p>
<p><b> C. Political crime bill 
</b></p>
<p>23. In September 2103, the &#8220;political crime&#8221; bill was introduced to Parliament and is 
currently being reviewed by the Cultural Commission.17 The bill appears to impose further 
limits on freedom of expression, association and assembly. According to article 1 of the 
bill, a political crime is any act meant to criticize the State or to obtain or maintain power, 
without intending to damage the fundamental principles and framework of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.18 According to article 2, political crimes are those that defame, insult and 
publish false information against government officials; it lists crimes defined by the 
Activities of Political and Professional Parties, Groups, Associations and Islamic 
Associations or Recognized Religious Minorities Law of 1981.19 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Right to liberty and security of persons 
</b></p>
<p>24. In February 2003, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, during a mission to 
the country, visited several prisons and detention centres, and met with representatives of 
the Government, parliament, the judiciary and non-governmental organizations, as well as 
with prisoners and their families.20 It made several observations, noting that situations of 
arbitrary detention were &#8220;essentially related to infringements of freedom of opinion and 
expression&#8221;, and &#8220;malfunctions in the administration of justice&#8221;, in particular concerning 
due process of law, abuse of solitary confinement, the role of revolutionary tribunals and 
clerical courts and the failure to take into account the principle of proportionality in passing 
sentence. It also noted that, while freedom of expression, assembly, association and belief 
(for recognized religions) are guaranteed by the Constitution, almost all prisoners they 
requested to visit had been prosecuted or tried for having peacefully exercised these 
constitutional rights, which made their detention arbitrary under category II of the Group&#8217;s 
working methods.21 
</p>
<p>25. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest. It requires that detainees be informed of 
their charges in writing &#8220;without delay&#8221;, stipulating in its article 32 that &#8220;a provisional 
dossier should be forwarded to the competent judicial authorities within a maximum of 24 
hours so that preliminary procedures to the trial may be completed as swiftly as possible&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>26. The 2004 Law on Respecting Legitimate Freedoms and Protecting Citizens&#8217; Rights 
contains 15 articles that specifically govern the conduct of individuals representing all

<p>courts, prosecutor and judicial offices when carrying out their legal duties. Like the 
Constitution, the law, in its article 5, forbids &#8220;arbitrary detention of individuals&#8221;, requires 
that families of detainees be &#8220;apprised of any and all developments&#8221; and forbids the use of 
&#8220;unknown places&#8221; for detention. In articles 6 and 7, it also forbids interrogators from 
using blindfolds, shackling or humiliating persons during arrests, or sitting behind detainees 
during interrogation. It directs officials to use questions that are &#8220;clear, purposeful and 
related directly or indirectly to the accusations&#8221; and to use &#8220;proper methods of investigation 
and modern techniques&#8221; during interrogations. It also forbids the use of torture to obtain 
confessions, and insists that forced confessions have no legal merit.  
</p>
<p>27. As at 14 January 2014, at least 895 &#8220;prisoners of conscience&#8221; and &#8220;political 
prisoners&#8221; were reportedly imprisoned. This number includes 379 political activists, 292 
religious practitioners, 92 human rights defenders (including 50 ethnic rights activists), 71 
civic activists, 37 journalists and netizens, and 24 student activists (see annex II). 
</p><p>28. The Special Rapporteur is struck by the magnitude, frequency and recurring nature 
of certain incidents reported by interviewees. The details given by interviewees depict 
situations of arbitrary detention, particularly the apparent arrest and detention of individuals 
for the peaceful exercise of fundamental rights, including the right to expression, 
association or belief, as described by other special procedures.22 Their testimonies also 
uniformly convey a pattern of abuse that violates both international and national safeguards 
for humane and fair treatment of detained and accused persons.  
</p>
<p>29. A majority of the 61 individuals located in Turkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran 
reported having been detained between 2003 and 2008, 11 reported detentions in 2009, and 
12 from 2009 onward. Half of all interviewees reported detentions lasting between six 
months and three years. Some 69 per cent reported that authorities either did not have 
warrants or refused to produce one when requested.23 In some cases, arrests were made at 
an intelligence office or revolutionary court after individuals responded to a verbal 
summons, not a written summons as required by the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>30. About half of all interviewees reported that they had been arrested at a private 
residence. The authorities had conducted extensive searches and often confiscated personal 
items, such as family photo albums. Several reported verbal and physical abuse of 
themselves and of family members during the arrest. In two thirds of cases, interviewees 
stated that they had been arrested on behalf of the Minister of Intelligence. Others reported 
that they had been arrested by various branches of the security forces, including the police, 
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps or Basij militia.  
</p><p>31. Approximately 85 per cent reported being held in Ministry of Intelligence detention 
centres or a local prison. It was reported that those taken to local prisons were often held in 
special intelligence or Islamic Revolutionary Guards wards, such as wards 209, 2A or 240 
of Evin prison in Tehran. They were reportedly held in these locations for the course of 
what appears to be an &#8220;initial stage of investigation&#8221;. A majority of interviewees reported 
that they were detained mostly incommunicado during the &#8220;investigation stage&#8221; for periods 
ranging from two days to four months, during which they were repeatedly interrogated.  
</p>
<p>32. Seventy-five per cent of interviewees reported having been held without any charge 
laid within 24 hours as stipulated by the Constitution. In 59 per cent of cases, detainees 
were formally charged after more than a week (in some cases, months) or never at all.

 Percentages are based on 29 formerly detained interviewees, with the exception of the number 
</p>
<p>associated with the trials, which are based on the 18 individuals that faced trial only. </p>


<p><b> A. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>33. Of the 92 human rights defenders currently reportedly detained (see table 1 below), 
at least 26 were charged with &#8220;membership in organizations that aim to disrupt national 
security&#8221; or &#8220;relations or collaboration with organizations that aim to disrupt national 
security&#8221; (both charges relate to article 499 of the Penal Code). At least 25 were charged 
with &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221;, and at least 14 were charged with &#8220;assembly and 
collusion against national security&#8221;. Other charges less frequently laid against these 
individuals include espionage and <i>moharebeh</i> (commonly translated as &#8220;enmity against 
God&#8221;, but translated by the Government as a crime in which &#8220;a person brandishes or points 
a weapon at members of the public to kill, frighten and coerce them&#8221;).24 Since 2010, the 
coordinated mass arrest of human rights defenders has served to effectively dismantle the 
most important Iranian human right organizations, including the Committee of Human 
Rights Reporters, the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (founded by Nobel Laureate 
Shirin Ebadi) and Human Rights Activists in Iran.25

<p>34. Of 39 bloggers and journalists currently detained in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
(including the recent arrest of seven computer technology workers),26 at least 12 were 
charged with &#8220;assembly and collusion&#8221;, 10 with &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and at 
least six with &#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader&#8221;.27 The number of persons concerned in each 
case is probably higher owing to the unknown circumstances surrounding the cases against 
some journalists and bloggers currently detained.

<p><b> C. Religious minorities  
</b></p>
<p>35. As at 3 January 2014, at least 307 members of religious minorities were in detention, 
of whom 136 were Baha&#8217;is, 90 Sunni Muslims, 50 Christians, 19 Dervish Muslims (four 
Dervish human rights lawyers were also reportedly detained), four were Yarasan, two were 
Zoroastrians and six were from other groups. A few were members of more newly formed 
spiritual groups, such as Inter-universalism, founded by Mohammad Ali Taheri. 
Additionally members of the official state religion Shia Islam, such as Ayatollah Hossein 
Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, have at times been imprisoned for their expression of theological 
beliefs that challenge those endorsed by the Government. 
</p>
<p>36. Former detainees often report being subjected to torture or cruel, inhumane or 
degrading treatment and prolonged solitary confinement to coerce confessions to 
accusations or admissions about other people. Many detainees also reported being held 
largely incommunicado, without access to a lawyer. Some prosecutions reportedly failed to 
meet international standards, marked by limited access to case files and the right to present 
a defence. Under the law, religious minorities, including recognized Jews, Christians and 
Zoroastrians, also face discrimination in the judicial system, such as hasher punishments 
than Muslims for certain crimes, and are barred from serving as judges. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Baha&#8217;is 
</b></p>
<p>37. At least 734 Baha&#8217;is have reportedly been arrested since 2004, and 136 are currently 
detained. Another 289 have been arrested, released on bail and awaiting trial, while another 
150 have been sentenced but are awaiting appeals or summons to serve.28  
</p>
<p>38. It appears that Baha&#8217;is are almost exclusively prosecuted for participation in their 
community affairs, including by facilitating educational services and publicly engaging in 
religious practices, such as attending devotional gatherings. The violations appear to be 
rooted in the unrecognized status of the faith, as well as a pervasive view held within the 
Government that Baha&#8217;is represent a heretical sect with ties to foreign enemies.29 They are 
typically charged with political and security crimes, such as espionage or &#8220;propaganda 
against the ruling system&#8221;. According to an unpublished submission from the Baha&#8217;i 
International Community, multiple revolutionary courts recently held that membership of 
&#8220;the misguided Baha&#8217;i sect&#8221; constituted a criminal offence. The same publication noted 
that, in a 1993 case involving the murder of two Baha&#8217;is, the Constitutional exclusion of 
Baha&#8217;is made them &#8220;unprotected infidels&#8221; within the justice system. Other sources report 
that judges are often openly hostile towards Baha&#8217;i defendants.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Christians 
</b></p>
<p>39. In recent years, Christians, many of whom are converts from Muslim backgrounds, 
have faced a similar pattern of persecution. At least 49 Christians were reportedly being 
detained in the Islamic Republic of Iran as at January 2014. In 2013 alone, the authorities 
reportedly arrested at least 42 Christians, of whom 35 were convicted for participation in

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>28
 Ataollah Rezvani, a Baha&#8217;i resident of the city of Bandar Abbas, was allegedly murdered on 24 
</p>
<p>August 2013. It has been alleged that his murder might be linked to his religion. The Government 
claimed, however, that the case was currently under investigation and that, on the basis of existing 
evidence, the cause of death was more likely suicide than murder. Some reports indicate, however, 
that the forensic findings contradict Government statements.

<p>informal &#8220;house churches&#8221;, association with churches outside the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
perceived or real evangelical activity, and other standard Christian activities. Sentences 
range from one to 10 years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>40. The Christians most commonly prosecuted appear to be converts from Muslim 
backgrounds or those that proselytize or minister to Iranian Muslims. Iranian authorities at 
the highest levels have designated house churches and evangelical Christians as threats to 
national security.30 
</p>
<p>41. While most cases involving Christians are tried in revolutionary courts for national 
security crimes, some Christians face charges in public criminal courts for manifestation of 
religious beliefs; for example, a court sentenced four Christians to 80 lashes each for 
drinking wine during communion in October 2013.31 Sources also reported that, although 
prosecutions for the capital offence of apostasy are very rare, officials routinely threaten to 
prosecute Christian converts for apostasy, which, while not found in any Iranian criminal 
law, has been prosecuted based on an Islamic law interpretation commonly used by Iranian 
courts.32 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Dervish and Sunni Muslims 
</b></p>
<p>42. Muslims are not immune from arrest, prosecution and judicial harassment in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. In recent years, authorities have targeted Dervish (namely, Sufi) 
Muslims, including members of the Nematollahi Gonabadi order. According to information 
submitted to the Special Rapporteur, since 2008, 90 Gonabadi Dervishes have been 
summoned to the Ministry of Intelligence for questioning, 391 have been summoned to 
public and revolutionary courts, and at least 238 Gonabadi Dervishes have been arrested. 
Altogether, these actions have resulted in at least 970 prosecutions since 2008, with some 
cases still open. 
</p>
<p>43. Human rights groups have reported numerous cases of detention of Sunni Muslims, 
the majority being imams or religious leaders. They often hail from ethnic minority 
communities, and routinely face multiple levels of discrimination and limits on their 
religious practices. Some Sunnis appear to be prosecuted for crimes that involve alleged 
acts of political violence, including capital crimes such as <i>moharebeh </i>(see para. 33 above). 
Human rights groups and a former political prisoner told the Special Rapporteur that the 
majority of Sunnis are detained for peaceful religious activism or theologically-based 
opposition to the political system in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Some have alleged that 
their convictions were based on confessions made under torture.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>44. As at January 2014, at least 50 ethnic rights defenders, 28 civic and cultural activists 
and 200 ethnic political activists were reported detained or imprisoned, many convicted of 
association with armed opposition groups. Sources challenge the legality of these 
detentions and convictions, alleging torture and denial of fair trial standards for a majority 
of these individuals.

<p>45. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the five Arab Ahwazi 
members of the Al-Hiwar cultural institute, who were arrested by the security forces in 
early 2011 and sentenced to death in July 2012. Their sentences were upheld by the 
Supreme Court on 9 January 2013. They were reportedly prosecuted for protected activities 
and convicted of <i>moharebeh</i>, <i>efsad fil-arz</i> (&#8220;corruption on earth&#8221;) and &#8220;spreading 
propaganda against the system&#8221;, reportedly in the absence of fair trial standards.33 
</p>
<p>46. According to reports submitted to the Special Rapporteur, five Azeri political and 
cultural activists, arrested between 31 December 2012 and 6 February 2013, were convicted 
and sentenced by branch 3 of the Revolutionary Court of Tabriz to nine years in prison for 
&#8220;founding an illegal group&#8221; and &#8220;propaganda against the State&#8221;. The five Azeri activists 
reportedly promoted the right to self-determination and the cultural and linguistic identity 
of Azeris in the Islamic Republic of Iran.On 16 June 2013, the Court of Appeals upheld the 
sentence.34 On 13 July 2013, the five activists embarked on a hunger strike to protest their 
alleged unfair trial and detention conditions.35 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the alleged reprisal for the killing of 
Iranian border forces, with the execution of 16 prisoners in the Sistan and Baluchistan 
province, the execution of four Ahwazi Arabs and the execution of two Kurdish political 
prisoners. In his statement on the executions, the Zahedan Revolutionary and Public 
Prosecutor maintained that the &#8220;wicked forces and opposition grouplets&#8221; had been warned 
that &#8220;we will retaliate against any action that harms innocent people and security and police 
forces. This morning, in response to the martyrdom of border forces in the City of Saravan, 
we executed 16 bandits that were connected to State opposition groups.&#8221;36  
</p>
<p>48. The head of the judiciary in Sistan and Baluchistan province reported that eight of 
the 16 individuals executed were charged with <i>moharebeh </i>and <i>efsad fil-arz </i>owing to their 
membership and cooperation with the Soldiers of Satan group and &#8220;participation in terrorist 
events in the province in recent years&#8221;, while the other eight were reportedly executed on 
drug-related charges.37 According to a number of reports, at least one juvenile offender was 
among the 16 persons executed.38  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at reports of the extrajudicial killing of 
Kulbars by border forces39 and the injury or death of civilians as a result of land mines; 17 
such cases were reported from March to October 2013.40  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the prosecution of cultural and 
labour activists. According to reports, labour activists were prosecuted for being members

 Report of the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights and Association of Human Rights in Kurdistan 
</p>
<p>of Iran-Geneva (KMMK-G) submitted to the office of the Special Rapporteur on 6 December 2013.  </p>


<p>of the Coordination Committee to Help Form Workers&#8217; Organizations in the Kurdistan and 
West Azerbaijan provinces and for participating in its general assembly.41  
</p><p>51. Officials have reportedly mandated management of Internet cafes in Paveh city 
(Kurdistan province) to record information on the citizens entering their venues. On 13 
December 2013, seven Kurdish cultural activists from Kurdistan province were sentenced 
to seven months of imprisonment by the Revolutionary Court of Paveh for reportedly 
promoting propaganda for Kurdish opposition political parties through social websites.42 
</p>
<p><b> V. Treatment of persons deprived of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Government accepted seven recommendations related to the treatment of 
detained persons during its universal periodic review in 2010, including to improve human 
rights education and training for judicial and law enforcement officials, to eliminate torture 
and other forms of ill treatment, to ensure an effective and impartial judicial system in 
conformity with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is guaranteed, and 
to take measures to ensure that government and security officials implicated in human 
rights abuses relating to extrajudicial and arbitrary detention and the possible use of torture 
are investigated, prosecuted and punished.43  
</p>
<p>53. Although the prison system in the Islamic Republic of Iran has an official capacity 
of 113,000, in 2010 there were more than 204,000 inmates, an occupancy rate of 192 per 
cent, namely, nearly twice its maximum physical capacity (and a sharp increase over the 
101,801 prisoners registered in 1993). The International Center for Prison Studies estimated 
that the rate of prisoners per population at 276 per 100,000 persons (2010), the 39th highest 
rate in the world.44 In 2011, the head of the national prison organization stated that the 
rising number of prisoners had thrown the penitentiary systems into crisis, and that the 
system faced a two-month budget shortfall every year.45 Living conditions for inmates are 
routinely reported to range from poor to inhumane. Access to medical services is often 
limited, and hygiene and nutrition are poor.46  
</p>
<p>54. A total of 69 per cent of the 133 interviewees reported having been held in solitary 
confinement for periods ranging from a few days to nine months. Solitary cells typically 
measure 2 to 2.5 m2 and contain little more than a blanket and a sleeping mat. They 
reported that they had been refused access to fresh air, books or a pen and paper, and had 
no human contact other than with guards and interrogators. In some cases, interviewees 
stated that they had been allowed to make brief telephone calls to their families in the 
presence of prison officials to report they were &#8220;fine&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>55. Almost all former detainees claimed that authorities had blindfolded them during 
transfers from cells to interrogation rooms or bathrooms. Nearly all reported having been 
made to face a wall or a corner during interrogation and being interrogated from behind by 
one to three interrogators. Interrogations allegedly lasted several hours, during which time 
interrogators usually attempted to coerce detainees to confess in writing to certain activities,

<p>and/or to sign other documents. In nearly all cases, former detainees reported having been 
subjected to torture or ill-treatment during interrogation and detention. 
</p><p>56. In 90 per cent of cases, former detainees claimed that their interrogators had 
subjected them to psychological abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, mock 
executions, threats to life, sexual harassment, threats to family members, harsh verbal abuse 
and threats of rape and other torture. Some 76 per cent also alleged that their interrogators 
physically abused them in the form of severe beatings to the head and body, often with a 
baton-like object. Some reported having been subjected to suspension and pressure 
positions, sexual molestation, electric shocks or burning. Some also reported having been 
transferred to general prison wards and shared cells after the investigation period, after 
which interrogations largely concluded. Some interviewees stated they were released 
shortly thereafter on bail.  
</p>
<p>57. In total, only 18 interviewees (34 per cent) stated that they had faced actual 
prosecution. Such persons were mainly charged with national security offences, while a few 
faced additional morality charges in public criminal courts. All interviewees reported 
various deviations from fair trial standards. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Right to a fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>58. In 2003, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention recommended the abolition of 
revolutionary and religious courts; the establishment of safeguards for legal counsel against 
intimidation; and the involvement of legal counsel from the beginning of a case, regardless 
of the nature of the allegations against the accused.47 
</p>
<p>59. In 2011, the Human Rights Committee recommended that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran should take immediate steps to ensure and protect the full independence and 
impartiality of the judiciary, and guarantee that its functioning is free from pressure and 
interference from the executive power and clergy. The Committee also recommended that 
the State should also ensure that judges, in interpreting legislation as well as in relying on 
religious principles, do not reach verdicts that are in contravention to the rights and 
principles laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.48 
</p>
<p><b> A. Independence of judges 
</b>60. The independence of the judiciary is provided for in article 156 of the Constitution 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The judiciary comprises multiple district courts, the 
jurisdiction of which is governed by the nature of the allegations against the accused. The 
revolutionary courts, before which most individuals identified as &#8220;prisoners of conscience&#8221; 
are prosecuted, preside over cases involving offences against &#8220;internal or external security&#8221;, 
drug offences and activities aimed at &#8220;fortifying the Pahlavi regime, suppressing the 
struggles of the Iranian people by giving orders or acting as agents, plundering the public 
treasury, and profiteering and forestalling the market of public commodities.&#8221;49 
</p>
<p>61. According to article 157 of the Constitution, the Head of the Judiciary is required to 
be a &#8220;doctor of religious law&#8221; and to possess knowledge of judicial matters. He has the 
power to appoint and dismiss judges, to define their jobs, to issue judicial promotions and

<p>transfers (arts. 158 and 164), and to appoint the Prosecutor General and the President of the 
Supreme Court (art. 162), which are therefore subject to the whims of the head of the 
judiciary.50 Under the Law on the Qualifications for the Appointment of Judges of 1982, 
Shia Muslim women may be appointed as advisory judges but may not preside over a 
court.51 
</p>
<p>62. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader, who is responsible 
for, inter alia, supervision of general policies governing the system, the command of the 
armed forces, and &#8220;signing the decree formalizing the election of the President of the 
Republic by the people&#8221;.52 The Supreme Leader&#8217;s influence over the judiciary was already 
noted with concern in 2001 by both the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers and the Special Representative on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran following a statement reportedly made by the First Deputy to the head of 
the judiciary that &#8220;judges must obey the Supreme Leader and have no independence in 
judgement&#8221;.53 
</p><p>63. Judges are called upon to adjudicate cases on the basis of codified law and, when the 
law is silent, to issue judgements on the basis of authoritative Islamic sources and authentic 
fatwas.54 Candidates for judgeship or prosecutorial positions are required to &#8220;have faith, be 
just and possess a practical commitment to Islamic principles and loyalty to the system of 
the Islamic Republic&#8221;.55  
</p>
<p>64. The above-mentioned qualifications are vetted through the <i>gozinesh </i>process, which 
involves investigations conducted by the Supreme Selection Council and the Ministry of 
Intelligence into the acceptability of an applicant&#8217;s beliefs, previous political opinions and 
affiliations, and repentance of any former political opinions and affiliations set forth in the 
Selection Law based on Religious and Ethical Standards of 1995.56  
</p>
<p>65. Lawyers reported that they believed that judges, particularly those in revolutionary 
courts, made their decisions almost exclusively on the basis of reports submitted by 
arresting and investigating intelligence officials (and confessions, if available). This 
approach was indeed reflected in the revolutionary court verdicts reviewed by the Special 
Rapporteur, which made extensive reference to the reports of the Ministry of Intelligence. 
Lawyers also reported that, in their experience, judges rarely considered evidence provided 
by the defence, and frequently chose to ignore allegations that confessions had been 
obtained under torture.

<p><b> B. Independence of lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>66. As found by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2003,57 the Special 
Rapporteur notes that lawyers are intimidated, detained and prosecuted for carrying out 
their professional responsibilities in defence of their clients. 
</p>
<p>67. More than 42 lawyers have reportedly faced detention, prosecution or harassment by 
security forces since 2009. Several have been stripped of their professional licences by the 
courts. Several lawyers also reported that they and their colleagues were often harassed or 
intimidated by judicial and/or intelligence authorities for carrying out their work, including 
for their defence of political (&#8220;security&#8221;) detainees. They also reported that, in more serious 
cases, judges threatened lawyers with prosecution for their work and that they were charged 
and/or had been sentenced for &#8220;insulting&#8221; judges or &#8220;disrupting the court&#8221; in apparent 
retaliation for their professional defence of individuals accused of political or &#8220;security&#8221; 
crimes.58  
</p>
<p>68. Mohammad Olyaei Fard, a human rights lawyer, reported that, in one of his cases, a 
judge ordered a prosecutor to file charges against him for publicizing false information 
about the Ministry of Intelligence, and requested that the bar association revoke his license 
in response to his assertion that his client&#8217;s confession had been obtained under duress and 
was therefore inadmissible. Mr. Olyaei Fard also reported that he also had to represent a 
lawyer colleague, Abdol Fatta Soltani, who is currently imprisoned, when Mr. Soltani was 
prosecuted for submitting allegations of torture on his client&#8217;s behalf. 
</p>
<p>69. Lawyers also reported that judicial and/or intelligence authorities intimidated 
lawyers or otherwise prevented them from carrying out their work by, for example, 
withholding necessary and relevant case documents or preventing timely face-to-face client 
meetings. One lawyer reported that, on several occasions, judges had refused entry to the 
courtroom when the lawyer attempted to make procedural requests, and had been 
threatened, in many cases by the judges themselves. The same lawyer also reported that, 
when attempting to present his/her defence in a &#8220;security&#8221; case, a presiding judge told the 
lawyer to &#8220;save it for your own trial&#8221;. The lawyer further reported that, in another trial 
where a group of women alleged having been raped by members of a criminal gang, a judge 
commented at the end of the trial that the plaintiffs certainly &#8220;also had something to do with 
it&#8221;, despite the conviction of the men. When the lawyer requested a record of the judge&#8217;s 
statement for the purposes of filing an official complaint, the judge threatened to charge the 
lawyer instead. The lawyer also claimed having witnessed judges denigrate female lawyers 
by, for example, ignoring procedural objections or requests made by the lawyers and, in 
turn, demanding that they adjust the positioning of their head covering or by having 
courtroom security guards do it. 
</p>
<p>70. According to sources, incidents against lawyers such as those mentioned above have 
led to a decline in the number of those willing to take on sensitive cases. The lawyers that 
do accept such cases are either in prison, have fled the country or in constant fear of arrest 
or other negative repercussions. 
</p>
<p>71. Lawyers also reported that this culture of intimidation deters them from raising 
reports of torture in their clients&#8217; defence for fear that judiciary and security forces might 
retaliate, including through prosecution or the revocation of their professional license, and

 Information was based on an interview conducted by the Special Rapporteur with an Iranian lawyer 
</p>
<p>on 20 December 2013. The source&#8217;s background was vetted prior to the interview, and all information 
provided was cross-checked with outside sources for credibility, accuracy and internal consistency. </p>


<p>often deters individuals from hiring legal counsel in order to avoid the accusation that 
hiring a lawyer is an admission of guilt.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Trial proceedings  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to legal counsel 
</b></p>
<p>72. Article 35 of the Constitution recognizes the right to elect an attorney in all courts, 
and clearly requires the courts to provide opportunities for the realization of this right. 
Article 3 of the Citizenship Rights Law of 2004 requires courts and prosecution offices to 
respect the right of the accused to a defence, and to provide the accused with the services of 
a defence attorney. Similar protections have been prescribed by the Criminal Procedure, as 
noted above. 
</p>
<p>73. All persons interviewed for the present report stated that they had had no access to a 
lawyer during the initial investigation stage of their case, which is precisely the period 
when most violations of fair trial standards occur. Some 56 per cent of interviewees who 
were prosecuted reported that they did not have a lawyer during their trial. In three cases, 
judges reportedly refused to allow the defendants to retain a lawyer of their choice. 
</p><p>74. In one case, the judge reportedly informed the defendant that if he did not bring his 
lawyer with him to trial, he would be given a lighter sentence. In several cases, a lawyer 
was actually present at trial, although the defendant did not have contact with the lawyer 
until a few days or just hours before trial. Some 27 per cent of interviewees stated that their 
lawyer did not have access to their case files, or obtained access only a few days earlier (or 
even just on the day of trial).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 
</b></p>
<p>75. For 45 per cent of interviewees who faced trial, the court allegedly did not permit 
the defendant to present a defence, or only allowed partial defence. In 43 per cent of cases, 
trials lasted only minutes. In 70 per cent of the trials, interviewees reported that coerced 
information or confessions had been reportedly used by the judge or made up at least part 
of the intelligence report presented by the prosecution. Some 65 per cent of interviewees 
reported that the judge had displayed signs of bias, such as by reproaching or interrogating 
defendants, and limiting their ability to speak and present a defence.  
</p>
<p>76. All interviewees reported that a court had found them guilty of most or all charges. 
Several interviewees stated that their lawyers had not been provided with copies of the 
verdict handed down by the revolutionary court; instead, they had been forced to copy the 
text of the verdict by hand, which was used to formulate their appeal. In some cases, 
appeals resulted in lighter sentences, but never acquittals. In all cases, final verdicts 
reportedly included a combination of prison sentence, suspended prison term, flogging, 
bans on professional activity or education, or fines. 
</p>
<p>77. One lawyer who has been practicing in the Islamic Republic of Iran for more than 10 
years reported irregularities observed during the representation of the more than 40 
individuals in the country&#8217;s revolutionary courts. The lawyer reported that a number of 
clients with &#8220;security&#8221; cases had been forced to confess to charges regardless of available 
evidence, and the lawyer had often not been permitted to review case files before trials, to 
meet with clients before and/or after trials, to present a full defence to the presiding judge 
or to be present in the courtroom throughout the pre-verdict trial proceedings, in accordance 
with the law.  </p>


<p>78. The lawyer also further reported that individuals accused of drug offences were 
often severely mistreated while in detention, often deprived of access to hygienic facilities, 
handcuffed and shackled together in court, and that their trials &#8220;never last more than a few 
minutes&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>79. The lawyer recalled that Iranian law allows for women who report rape to be 
prosecuted of adultery in cases where they are unable to convince a judge of their charges, 
given that the allegations imply that the women had engaged in extra-marital relations. The 
lawyer also pointed out that rape cases were very difficult to prove and put women wishing 
to report the crime at risk of being prosecuted for a capital offence, which likely deterred 
women victims from coming forward. Moreover, women alleging rape must often subject 
themselves to intrusive &#8220;virginity&#8221; tests.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>80. It has been estimated that some 1,539 individuals have been executed, including at 
least between 955 and 962 for drug trafficking, since the establishment of the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur in 2011 (see table 2 below).59 Some 687 individuals are thought to 
have been executed in 2013 (369 of which were announced by official or semi-official 
government sources), an increase of 165 over the figures recorded for 2012, despite the fact 
that executions effectively ceased for several lengths of time that year: from 1 March to 15 
April, during which only four persons were executed;60 during the presidential elections 
between 23 May and 16 June, when only two were executed;61 and during Ramadan, from 8 
July to 13 August 2013, when three people were executed. 
</p>

Executions in the Islamic Republic of Iran: 2003 &#8211; 2013 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>81. In 2013, at least 57 individuals were hanged publicly (one of whom was pardoned 
after surviving the execution), including at least 28 women. A number of individuals were 
reportedly convicted in the absence of fair trial standards and executed for the crimes of 
<i>moharebeh</i>,<i> efsad fil-arz</i> or for &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;.  
82. In late October and early November 2013, three Kurds were executed for <i>moharebeh 
</i>and for &#8220;attempting to overthrow the Government&#8221;. In November, four individuals from the

<p>Arab Ahwazi minority community were executed for &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;, 
<i>moharebeh</i> and <i>efsad fil-arz</i>.62  
</p>
<p>83. Four additional Kurdish individuals &#8211; Jamshid and Jahanghir Dehgani, Hamed 
Ahmadi and Kamal Molayee &#8211; appear to be at imminent risk of execution for the &#8220;crimes&#8221; 
of <i>moharebeh</i> and <i>efsad fil-arz</i>.63 Sources have reported that they were convicted in the 
absence of fair trial standards. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to halt these 
executions, commute their sentences and investigate complaints of violations of fair trial 
guarantees.64  
</p>
<p>84. While the new Islamic Penal Code has excluded the possibility of execution for 
&#8220;security crimes&#8221; in which weapons were not used,65 it retains the death penalty for certain 
crimes not meeting international standards for &#8220;most serious&#8221;, including recidivist alcohol 
consumption, adultery, consensual homosexual sex and drug possession or trafficking.66 
</p>
<p> 85. The drug problem faced by the Islamic Republic of Iran is both significant and 
complex. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated in 2011 that 
some 1.2 million Iranians were opiate users, one of the highest rates globally. Drug 
trafficking and related crimes have posed major law enforcement and security challenges. 
Iranian officials have estimated that the fight against drug addiction and trafficking costs $1 
billion a year.67  
</p>
<p>86. The Islamic Republic of Iran prescribes the death penalty for a variety of drug-
related activities, including drug manufacturing and trafficking, but it can also be applied to 
the personal possession of 30g of heroin, morphine or specified synthetic and non-medical 
psychotropic drugs, such as methamphetamines, without an effective right of appeal.68 Drug 
offences continue to account for most cases of capital punishment in the country, resulting 
in the highest known per capita level of executions globally. It was estimated that at least 
302 of the 624 executions held in 2013 were for alleged drug possession or trafficking,69 
although the actual number is possibly higher, given that the reasons for the execution of 
another 90 individuals remain unknown. This application of the death penalty in the Islamic

<p>Republic of Iran affects many of the most vulnerable in society, and accordingly has a 
disproportionate impact on minorities.  
</p>
<p>87. UNODC has been engaged in the Islamic Republic of Iran since 1999, providing the 
Government with significant technical assistance and capacity-building. In 2010, UNODC 
and the State concluded a multilateral programme of technical cooperation for the period 
2011-2014.70 Under the programme, UNODC and the State have worked together on sub-
programmes that include a focus on law enforcement and on crime, justice and corruption. 
The Special Rapporteur encourages the Islamic Republic of Iran to take advantage of the 
support offered by UNODC to address the concerns identified above, in particular in the 
area of criminal justice reform.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Socioeconomic rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>88. According to Daftar Tahkim Vahdat, an Iranian student organization, from April 
2005 to March 2013, at least 935 university students were deprived of continuing education 
for either one or more semesters for political activities, including publishing articles, 
organizing political events and engaging in student rights organizations perceived to be 
problematic by Iranian security forces. These individuals were routinely expelled or 
suspended during the period 2011-2013.71  
</p>
<p>89. The Ministry of Science, Research and Technology proposed the return of these 
students.72 According to the proposal, the students expelled after 2010 would be able to 
return to the schools previously attended, while those expelled between 2006 and 2010 
would be required to retake national entrance exams, but they would not be subject to the 
<i>gozinesh</i> process upon acceptance.73 It has been reported that, in most cases, expelled 
students have been able to return only after pledging to the Sanjesh Oorganization that they 
would abide by university rules and not participate in any anti-government activities.74 On 
23 December 2013, the Gozinesh Central Committee announced that 126 of the 400 
students who had been deprived of education had been able to continue their education,75 
although some students maintain that their appeals against expulsion had been rejected.76  
90. A member of the Education and Research Committee of Parliament stated that the 
Ministry of Intelligence was currently vetting students that had returned to school, and that 
students with negative vetting results would be removed again. Another Committee member 
stated that the Committee would like the Ministry to vet the political background of the 
students that had returned to school; if no &#8220;acute&#8221; security issue was identified, they would 
be able to continue their education. The Committee member clarified that, if the vetting

<p>result was negative, it would be up to the Ministry of intelligence to propose a course of 
action to the Committee.77  
</p>
<p>91. At least 41 professors have been reportedly expelled from their universities. A 
special committee has been reportedly created to investigate complaints concerning the 
forced retirement of professors deemed to hold views departing from those of the 
Government.78 Reportedly, 18 of the professors have been invited to return to work, while 
the requests of 10 to 12 others are under review.79 According to Mohammad Sharif, a 
university professor and lawyer who was reportedly expelled from university for his human 
rights activities, to date retired professors have returned as visiting professors without 
nullifying their retirement, while those expelled have not received any compensation.80  
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic sanctions 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly urged sanctions-imposing countries and the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take steps to ensure that sanctions do not 
undermine human rights, including by strengthening humanitarian safeguards that appear to 
be falling short of their intended purpose. Sanction relief measures reportedly embedded in 
the recent agreement on a joint plan of action reached between the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and the five plus one group, if properly administered, would likely have a positive impact 
on the enjoyment of economic and social rights in the country, which would be a welcome 
development. According to the agreement, the parties are to take tentative steps towards 
establishing a banking channel to facilitate humanitarian trade. The Special Rapporteur 
would welcome such an outcome, as it could alleviate some of the right-to-health 
challenges and other hardships identified in previous reports.81 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>93.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls his view that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
possesses the basic tools necessary to observe its international human rights 
obligations. They include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and various aspects 
of a number of national laws. He affirms that human rights could be better secured if 
the principles and regulations stipulated by these laws were consistently implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Special Rapporteur also stresses that, despite recent welcome amendments 
to the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure, and the proposal for a new charter of 
citizens&#8217; rights, these documents do not appear to resolve fully the issues previously 
raised by United Nations human rights mechanisms and recommendations made 
during the universal periodic review of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2010. Certain 
national laws continue to undermine and/or contravene rights guaranteed by these 
legal instruments through extensive restrictions and discriminatory practices.

<p>95. <b>Reports received by the Special Rapporteur continue to detail cases of frequent 
infringement of the rule of law established by national laws and international 
standards, resulting in the arbitrary detention of hundreds of individuals peacefully 
exercising rights guaranteed by the above-mentioned treaties. The violation of the 
rights and guidelines enshrined in the Constitution, the Law on Respecting Legitimate 
Freedoms and Protecting Citizens&#8217; Rights and the Criminal Procedure has also 
apparently resulted in the psychological and physical torture of persons for the 
purposes of extorting information that is reportedly used as evidence in court, the 
basis for convictions and the application of lengthy or capital sentences. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Most of the said violations are reportedly committed during pretrial detention 
or court sessions. The Special Rapporteur therefore urges the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to consider the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To facilitate the unconditional release of individuals imprisoned for 
exercising peacefully their rights to expression, association, assembly, belief and 
religion;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To strengthen fair trial safeguards by ensuring access to legal counsel 
during all phases of pretrial detention and the investigative stage of cases, including 
during interrogation and arraignment, and allow for legal counsel to advise the 
accused during these proceedings; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To improve access of legal counsel to all files containing evidence against 
the accused;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To investigate all allegations of mistreatment and/or psychological and 
physical torture, and to prosecute the parties responsible;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) To prevent the intimidation of lawyers, including threats of detention 
and prosecution for discharging their ethical and professional responsibilities, 
including when submitting client grievances and addressing international and 
national media on their client&#8217;s behalf, which should be possible without fear of 
prosecution under national security and defamation laws;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) To prohibit capital punishment for juveniles and for crimes that do not 
meet the most serious crimes standards under international law, including for drug 
offences and perceived sexual offences.

<p><b>Annex II 
</b></p>
<p><b>Case summaries 
</b>Interviews from a selection of the meetings held by the Special Rapporteur during his 
December 2013 fact-finding mission in the Netherlands, Germany and France, or otherwise 
conducted during the reporting period for this report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Hamid Ghassemi-Shall 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. Hamid Ghassemi-Shall - former prisoner / brother of prisoner, who allegedly died in 
detention. 
</p>
<p>In May 2008, Mr. Alborz Ghassemi-Shall, a retired Iranian army officer, was arrested by 
military police in Tehran while attempting to pick up his passport, as required by Iranian 
law for certain retired military officials. Twelve days later, his brother Mr. Hamid 
Ghassemi-Shall was also arrested at a military intelligence office while attempting to pick 
up his own passport, which had allegedly been seized upon his brother&#8217;s arrest.  
</p>
<p>Both Alborz and Hamid were reportedly held in solitary confinement without access to a 
lawyer for 70 days at a military detention facility number 36 in downtown Tehran, at which 
point they were taken to an investigative judge. They were then allegedly returned to 
solitary confinement at the same facility, and only brought to trial at the Revolutionary 
Court&#8217;s Branch 29 on 30 December 2008, a date eventually postponed to 29 April 2009 due 
to a procedural requirement by the judge assigned to the case. The brothers were reportedly 
only able to access a lawyer shortly before the trial, and to meet with their counsel for 15 
minutes prior to the trial, which lasted a total of two hours. They were sentenced to death 
for alleged connections to the Mujahidin e- Khalq (MEK) Organization, although they were 
apparently not officially notified of this judgment until December of that year.  
On 13 May 2009, both brothers were transferred to solitary confinement at Evin Prison, 
where they remained until 29 November 2009, when they were transferred to Ward 350 
(Evin&#8217;s general population ward for political prisoners).  
On 19 December 2009, the brothers were reportedly transferred to the army&#8217;s Intelligence 
center and offered sentence-reductions in exchange for apology letters. Mr. Alborz 
Ghassemi-Shall apparently suffered a panic attack and was taken to a military hospital from 
the site where they were to write the letters. He was released on 25 December 2010, but his 
health continued to deteriorate to the point that he could not see or walk by the end of 
January 2010. By this time, Evin officials confirmed that he suffered from a tumor in his 
stomach, but were allegedly not permitted by intelligence officials to release him to be 
treated outside of the prison. Mr. Alborz Ghassemi-Shall died in Evin Prison on 19 January 
</p><p>2010.  
</p>
<p>In November 2011, a representative of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office contacted Mr. Hamid 
Ghassemi-Shall in prison to inform him that he did not believe there was sufficient state 
evidence to implicate anyone in his family of the activities for which he was still serving 
prison time. After further intercession by an Intelligence officer and continued pressure 
from the official in the Prosecutor&#8217;s office, Mr. Ghassemi-Shall was re-tried and given a 
new five-year sentence for espionage only, despite the fact that he had apparently been 
cleared of that particular charge already in 2008, during the investigative phase of his case. 
After further pressure from family members and officials, authorities agreed to count his 
first year in detention as prison time toward the new five-year sentence, such that he had </p>


<p>completed service of his sentence. He was released in September 2013 and returned to 
Canada, where he is a citizen and where he had lived prior to his arrest.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Hamid Ghassemi-Shall&#8217;s conviction and sentence were apparently upheld three times 
by the Iranian Supreme Court before he was eventually granted a re-trial.  
</p>
<p><b>  Yahsar Khamenei  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Blogger  
</b></p>
<p>Mr. Yashar Khameini worked for a satirical Facebook page which used religion to satirize 
the Iranian authorities&#8217; reported sensitivity to criticism of religion.  
</p>
<p>In May 2012, his family contacted him and told him that authorities threatened to take his 
father to prison if he did not cease his participation in the page. He did stop his involvement 
but his family told him that authorities took his father into custody anyway. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Khamenei&#8217;s father was eventually &#8220;exonerated&#8221; of his son&#8217;s &#8220;crime&#8221; of insulting Islam, 
but in October 2013, he found out that his father has been sentenced to jail for one year for 
possession of a bottle of alcohol, a satellite television, and pepper spray, for which he had a 
permit. (They had seized all of these items the first time they arrested him).  
In November 2013, his father was summoned and he showed up and introduced himself, 
but the prison authorities told him he was free to go.  
</p>
<p>His father therefore remains in a state of quasi-semi legal limbo. Though he is exonerated 
from the original charge, it is clear that authorities continue to maintain a case against him. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mohamed Ali Khalili  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human rights lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>Mr Ali Khalili was a lawyer in Iran with the Bar. He taught at University, and is also an 
expert on international law.  
</p>
<p>In one case he took on, there were several people who were arrested trying to defend 
Azerbaijani rights. They were arrested without due process and put in the hands of the 
Ministry of Information. Mr. Khalili took this case on and clashed with the judge on the 
case. His role was &#8220;only to ask that the rights of these individuals -- in accordance with 
Iranian law -- be respected.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>He had to bring a procedural suit against the Prosecutor-General and judicial officials in 
Eastern Azerbaijan when he felt he was unable to do this due to his relationship with the 
judge on the case.  
One morning in 2004, four people from the Ministry of Intelligence stormed his office and 
searched everything. They also seized laptops and other materials. They drove him to his 
house, where his wife (who had just given birth) was there with her mother. They told him 
to knock on the door, which he did, and he told his wife that he was there with an officer.  
</p>
<p>They said they wanted to search his apartment for &#8220;the drugs and alcohol that he uses.&#8221; He 
denied using anything. He demanded a warrant and mentioned that he was a lawyer and 
knew his rights, but they ignored him.  
</p>
<p>They searched the house, took his computer and satellite dish, and took him to the office of 
the Ministry of Information. No official even asked for his name for 16 days while he was 
in detention.  </p>


<p>On the sixteenth day, they asked him to hand over his identification documents, but he told 
them that authorities had seized it in the arrest. So they put him back in a car and took him 
to the Prosecutor&#8217;s office. When they took him to that office, he was handcuffed on both 
sides of his body to two chairs, in what he believes was meant to be an embarrassing show.  
</p>
<p>He was handcuffed to a chair for 4-5 hours.  
</p>
<p>He was then taken into a courtroom and a judge arrived with a full list of documents and 
demanded that he sign it. Mr. Khalili said that he would not sign, because there was no 
warrant to arrest him, and because he didn&#8217;t know the contents of the document. The judge 
said: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, I will just write here that you refused to sign.&#8221; 
The judge decided he would be freed on bail for 200 million rials, but did not charge him. 
Mr. Ali Khalili said he would pay the bond in cash. The judge said: &#8220;In that case, sit down.&#8221; 
It was clear to Mr. Khalili that he wanted to wait until the business day ended for banks, so 
that he would have to spend the night in prison.  
</p>
<p>He was taken to jail. While they asked for his fingerprints and identification, he asked the 
guards to tell him what he was charged with. They told him &#8220;illicit relations and forming a 
prostitution ring.&#8221; Mr. Khalili points out that in Iran, when a person brings charges against 
a judge, they often counter-charge him personally with immorality charges. 
Eventually, the Prosecutor&#8217;s office accepted the bail payment. His colleagues warned him 
that authorities were compiling a list of charges against him and that he should leave the 
country. He left through the Turkish border and went to the UNHCR office in Van, where 
he registered. He was given an interview date by the UNHCR for a month from that time. 
During his time at a hotel there, he saw some suspicious people in the hotel. He wrote 
letters to the police in Van, and they called him back and told him they would arrange an 
interview in their office with him. One day after that, he was arrested by members of the 
Turkish police. In the car, there were also members of the Iranian Ministry of Information. 
He was taken back to Iran.  
</p>
<p>He was taken to Section 350 of Evin prison (controlled by the Revolutionary Guards) and 
was placed in solitary confinement for three months. They allegedly fed him food with 
hallucinogens, and he began to see things. Some of his friends, including Mr. Dadkhakh 
and Mr. Seif, &#8220;had the same experience&#8221; (&#8220;it&#8217;s called white torture in Iran&#8221;).  
He was then transferred to the Revolutionary Guard Prison in Tabriz. When he was there he 
learned that he had already been charged with: &#8220;encouraging corruption and prostitution (1 
year in prison), illicit prostitution (99 lashes), working as a spy, working against national 
security, and exchanging information with foreigners,&#8221; which altogether constituted 
<i>Moharebeh (</i>enmity against God). 
He was released based on a claim that he was mentally unstable.  
</p>
<p>Thereafter he had to prove that he was undergoing treatment at a psychiatric hospital. His 
file was sent to a chamber in the Supreme Court. During that time he would go to see a 
psychologist and report to the Branch of Legal Medicine so that he would not be re-
arrested.  
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, authorities confiscated all of his belongings and blocked all of his bank 
accounts. He had been renting out apartments, and the renters arranged with the judiciary 
not to pay him. He took this case to court, but it was rejected.  
He began writing letters to a human rights organization from internet cafes, but authorities 
tracked him and reinstated the execution order against him. He fled the country. </p>


<p><b>  Ashraf Qurbani 
  Lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. Qurbani is the wife of Mr. Mohamed Ali Khalili.  
She notes that lawyers have a lot of difficulty working in Iran, and they &#8220;would all tell you 
this.&#8221; They cannot defend their clients freely. Lawyers are always treated badly in the 
Prosecutors&#8217; offices. When lawyers go into Prosecutors&#8217; offices, their phones are seized, 
and their items are seized &#8220;as if they were criminals.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Moreover, there is currently a bill in Iran meant to strip the Bar Association of &#8220;whatever 
independence it does have.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>There is one case, in Chamber 1 of the General Court in Tabriz, regarding a young woman 
named Azzam Malekpour. She has been in Tabriz Prison since 2012 without charge. She is 
the daughter of a man who owns a textile company. A few years back, her father gave a 
check as a loan payment, but the amount bounced. The intended recipient charged the 
daughter as a way to pressure the father, since she was at the time managing his factory.  
</p>
<p>Even though it is illegal in Iran to charge an individual for someone else&#8217;s crime, she was 
allegedly convicted <i>in</i> <i>absentia</i>, as she was not aware of the charges and thus did not show 
up (&#8220;the person who is supposed to deliver the summonses in &#8216;bogus cases&#8217; never showed 
up; they just put a stamp on the document saying the address was invalid.&#8221;).  
At the time, Ms. Malekpour was living her fiance in Tehran. The Tehran prosecutor 
authorized authorities to arrest her from that house, from where they transferred her to 
Tabriz.  
</p>
<p>When they took her to prison, her family went to the Bar Association and requested a 
lawyer. That lawyer was not able to do much. So they came to Ms. Qurbani.  
When Ms. Qurbani got into the Prosecutor&#8217;s office, the secretary there saw the file she was 
looking at and told her that one of the chief Prosecutors had been involved in that case, and 
that he would not drop it unless he personally received half the amount of the owed money.  
</p>
<p>Her fiance is now leaving her, since a woman who has been in prison &#8220;is looked down 
upon.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Another case she works on: Five people in Tehran got together and decided to offer loans, 
independently from the Government. Another bank, run by the Revolutionary Guards, 
could not compete with them, so the latter tried to force them to merge, but they refused. 
After this meeting they sent texts to everyone they knew in town to protect themselves, 
since they knew the Revolutionary Guards now &#8220;had it in for them.&#8221; Two hours later, they 
were taken into detention. Ms. Qurbani tried to meet with them, but was told they were still 
under investigation. She was able to meet with families of the victims four months later, 
who said they had since lost 20 kgs. each. They are still in detention and their case is with 
Court Chamber 4.  
</p>
<p>A final case: Criminal Court, Chamber 170; about nine months ago, during the evening of 
mourning for Imam Ali, a young man happened to be in the street instead of at mosque. He 
was arrested by Basijis with weapons. Ms. Qurbani was called in and arrived at the station, 
but was herself threatened by Basijis. They are now accusing the victim of attacking the 
Basijis.  </p>


<p><b>  Foad Sajoodi Farimani 
  Student activist 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. Farimani was publicly advertising his beliefs about religion, where he was a PhD 
student.  
</p>
<p>He was arrested for this in front of his university on September 2010 by plainclothes 
officers. He was &#8220;scared that they would arrest and disappear him,&#8221; so he ran inside the 
university building so that they would have to get &#8220;real police to arrest him.&#8221; But they 
pursued him, they pushed him against the wall, pulled him up from the floor, handcuffed 
him, and held a gun to his head. 
</p>
<p>They took him to Evin Prison, which relieved him because it&#8217;s an &#8220;official prison.&#8221; He had 
no lawyer, no charges were presented to him, and he was put in solitary confinement for 
more than 40 days (in a 2 by 1.5 meter room).  
One of his interrogators asked why he did not necessarily believe in (the Government-
approved version of) Islam. He tried to make the argument for it, and one of them put a 
rope around his neck and pulled to the side. &#8220;This was mental torture,&#8221; according to Mr. 
Farimani.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have a physical wound, you can see a scar, but when you have a mental wound 
you can&#8217;t see it.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>He was sentenced to five years for blasphemy, additional time for acting against national 
security, and three months for each political figure he insulted. (The Revolutionary Guards 
had actually asked the prosecutor to seek the death penalty for blasphemy). 
After 105 days, he was released on five million tuman bail, which a family member 
eventually had to pay for by selling his house.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no difference between keeping me in jail or forcing me to work 12 hours a day to 
pay off a debt; either way I can&#8217;t carry out my human rights work.&#8221;

<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Jamshid&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Filmmaker 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. &#8220;Jamshid&#8221; left Iran in after the 2009 election crisis. Before that, he had been working 
with a western filmmaker. During the election, he was filming others and was beaten by 
forces in the street and taken to the Interior Ministry. He was quickly released.  
</p>
<p>A few days after his arrest, Mr. Jamshid received a suspicious and threatening phone call, 
so he looked to flee the country.  
</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago (December 2013) a friend of his was arrested and was asked about his 
whereabouts. He is worried, therefore, that authorities are still interested in his case.  
</p>
<p><b>  Bardia Taherpour 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political activist 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. Bardia Taherpour left Iran three years ago.  
</p>
<p>He had been politically active in Iran for 10-12 years before leaving Iran. He began his 
activities one year before university, then went to Dubai after university, returned to Iran, 
and was arrested upon return. </p>


<p>Before leaving Iran, he was arrested three times for protests (related to, inter alia, workers&#8217; 
rights): once for five days, once for two, and once for 15. He was always in detention 
centers, though, and never in prison per se. He was sometimes treated well, for what he 
believes were &#8220;propaganda purposes.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>When he went to Dubai, he and other friends in the West and other countries established a 
blog. The blog was not mostly political; it was meant to expose religious hypocrisy. In 
Dubai, he protested in front of the Iranian Embassy on three occasions following the events 
of the 2009 election. Iranian authorities were filming all of the demonstrators from the roof 
of the building, and, he now presumes, identifying them and looking into their 
backgrounds.  
</p>
<p>He returned to Iran because his father was gravely ill. (His father eventually died while he 
was in jail).  
He was taken to the Ershad Prosecutor&#8217;s office (north Tehran). He was kept this time for 43 
days before his release. He had two interrogators while in detention.

<p><b>  Dr. Sohrab Razaghi  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Journalist 
</b>In the (Persian) year 1390 (2011-2012), 84 associations (publications) were shut down. 
Many publications are closed down without any sort of process, prior notification, or trial, 
according to Dr. Razzaghi. His own organization was shut down in 2007 in this way, and he 
was arrested then.  
</p>
<p>Moreover, a number of publications that were shut down under the prior administration 
have approached the authorities for renewal and been denied on dubious grounds. <i>Neshat</i>, 
for example, was already cleared of charges during President Ahmadinejad&#8217;s second term, 
and had gone through the whole process of re-registering, but was recently prevented from 
re-opening through an intervention by the judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b>  Isa Saharkhiz 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Journalist and former political prisoner 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. Saharkhiz is a journalist and human rights activist. He was chief of the Iranian news 
agency (IRNA) in New York from 1992-1997. When Mr. Khatami (a former colleague of 
his) was elected President, he returned to Iran and become Director-General for all internal 
newspapers in Iran (part of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance). His plan was to 
develop journalism by giving permission to an increasing number of publications and 
through contacts at the international level. He helped found the Association for the 
Protection of Press Freedom in Iran, &#8220;a sort of Iranian equivalent of CPJ,&#8221; but more of a 
trade union for journalists.  
When &#8220;non-reformists&#8221; were elected to the Parliament (and later to the Presidency), it 
became increasingly difficult to work, and he resigned around the time the judiciary began 
to build a case against him. He worked in the private sector and for the semi-governmental 
committee which approves media publications. 
</p>
<p>In 2009, this association was shut down, and many of its members were arrested, including 
him. A number are still in prison, and many have been forced to leave the country.  </p>


<p>Mr. Saharkhiz was also charged with insulting the Supreme Leader. His trial was held &#8220;in 
violation of the Constitution, Article 168 in particular, which provides for the right to a 
lawyer and trial-by-jury.&#8221; In reality, he was tried behind closed doors.  
When he was arrested, he was severely beaten and injured, but he survived the beating and 
was sent to Evin Prison section 209.  
</p>
<p>He was kept in solitary confinement initially, in a small cell (two-by-three meters) for three 
months. He had been fainting and lost consciousness a number of times due to kidney and 
other problems. At one point, another prisoner -- an Afghan drug dealer -- was put in the 
cell with him in order to alert guards if he would lose consciousness. He was not permitted 
necessary access to the toilet, and since he had prostate problems his uric acid level built 
up, leading to more kidney problems.  
</p>
<p>One night in January, he was forced to go to the prison roof and stand there in only a t-shirt 
and no shoes for two hours (it was -6 or -7 degrees Centigrade). His toes would stick to the 
ground when he walked, so he would run and his toes became covered in blisters. He 
became frostbitten, which is still an issue for him to this day. He also got a sinus infection 
and a cold from that experience. He became more and more ill, until finally he was 
transferred to a hospital. He was required to take 32 different pills for anemia, prostate 
problems, and blood pressure problems. The doctors feared he would have heart failure. 
Usually under such conditions, one is granted furlough or permitted to obtain proper 
medical treatment. In his case however, he was kept under guard (three guards at all times) 
in the hospital for 20 months. 
</p>
<p>He still suffers from blood pressure problems, and his kidneys have lost 70% of their 
function.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Faraz&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Christian adherent  
</b></p>
<p>He has been a Christian since 2010, when he converted. Christians in Iran are face 
difficulty practicing their religion -- not only converts but also individuals who were born 
Christian. Often &#8220;individuals who visit Christian websites have a virus implanted on their 
computer.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>The Supreme Leader made a speech in 1389 (2010-2011) concerning House Churches, and 
the Revolutionary Guards from that point cracked down more harshly on them. The entire 
task of &#8220;dealing&#8221; with converts has been placed under the authority of the Intelligence and 
security structures of the Revolutionary Guards. They operate independently and outside 
the scope of the law, since they are only accountable to the Leader.  
</p>
<p>In his own case, in early 2013 authorities came to arrest him because of his affiliation with 
a Church group, (which he says was a prayer group, although he notes that authorities 
believe they have political activities), but they mistakenly arrested a different family 
member after spending three hours in the house with members of his family. 
</p>
<p>In general, Christian religious practice is monitored and heavily regulated. For example, 
Muslim converts to Christianity cannot enter Armenian or Assyrian Churches, as all 
churchgoers must register with the Government. Authorities often place cameras in 
churches. Christians, especially converts, are careful to use certain euphemistic language in 
communications.  
</p>
<p>When ministers or other visible Christian figures are arrested, they are most often pressed 
to reveal foreign contacts or financial connections / benefactors. According to Faraz, </p>


<p>though, the Protestants in Iran have no political ambitions or aims to overthrow the current 
Government or the Islamic Republic.  
</p>
<p><b>  Jahanghir Esmailpour  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Author / former political activist 
</b></p>
<p>He left Iran in 1996. 
</p>
<p>He was first arrested in 1979 because of trade union activities, and then was arrested again 
in 1980 on charges of passing out brochures for the <i>fedayeen</i>. It was still early after the 
Revolution, and the Islamic Republic &#8220;had not yet consolidated.&#8221; He was asked to pledge 
not to continue his activities, but he refused, and spent six months in jail.  
In the winter of 1982, he was arrested a third time and spent six years in prison. He was 
released around the time of the mass executions of 1988. His trial lasted minutes. He 
mistakenly believed that things would get better after his trial; that he would go to prison 
and that the mistreatment would stop, but this was not the case. He notes that at the time 
there was a cycle in Iran; interrogators would torture confessions out of prisoners, then 
when prisoners would deny them in court, they would be sent back for interrogation. In a 
way, he says, they would not consider the case closed until a confession was obtained and 
confirmed.  
</p>
<p>Regarding the 1988 executions: Word had spread amongst prisoners that the MEK had 
crossed into Iran. A <i>fatwa</i> from the Supreme Leader around that time proclaimed that all 
affiliated would have to be punished for this, but they did not believe the order would be 
carried out. In fact, authorities began to make statements implying that prisoners would 
soon be released. However, the executions did begin. They began with repeat offender 
prisoners, who they seemed to believe &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be reformed.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Some individuals were transferred to Revolutionary Guard centers, from where they never 
returned. Others were executed in prisons, including at Adel Abad prison in Shiraz, where 
Mr. Esmailpour was at the time (cell number 10, first floor).  
Over the course of about six months, authorities purged the prisons of almost all MEK 
members. He recalls the few people who did return from such scenes reporting having been 
questioned about their loyalties and whether or not they were willing to die for the MEK. In 
prison, the administrator announced over the loudspeaker that &#8220;now, it will be the leftists&#8217; 
turn.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>He was transferred along with two others leftist to a Detention Center and was kept in 
solitary confinement. One of the others was taken away at night, so they assumed he had 
been executed. Then, Mr. Esmailpour was taken away. Two guards played &#8220;good cop, bad 
cop.&#8221; He thought he was going to be executed, that they were preparing the ground for his 
execution. At one point, he asked them why they were doing this to him, and they 
responded, &#8220;because you are forming political groups in the prison.&#8221; He was not executed 
this time, however, but returned to his cell. He believes he was saved in that particular 
instance because of pressure that had been applied regarding his case by Amnesty 
International (friends who had been concerned over his case had contacted the 
organization). 
He spent 2.5 months at this center, during which he was taken for 10 interrogations, and 
mostly lectured about the virtues of Islam vs. socialism. He was then returned to his cell at 
Adel Abad. At this point, he realized that he would likely not be killed. In all, 250 or 270 
people from just his prison were executed, mostly members of the MEK, during that period. 
In the end, only a few non-MEK leftists were actually executed. Before he was released in </p>


<p>the winter of 1988, he and other leftists were told that they could now &#8220;leave and get on 
with their lives.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>After his release, Mr. Esmailpour was required to check in regularly with the Intelligence 
Ministry. Authorities also continued to keep tabs on his contacts and travels (he was not 
permitted to leave the country).  
When he later applied for a passport, he was taken into detention, but released when the 
Intelligence officer detaining him was contacted by a relative who worked in Government.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Esmailpour tried to live a normal life in Iran, but his record followed him everywhere 
he went. He had trouble securing or maintaining employment; for example, and he was 
worried about the educational prospects for his children.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reza Nejabat 
  Former political prisoner 
</b></p>
<p>He left Iran in the summer of 1995, but his wife, son, and daughter had left three years 
earlier than that (authorities had opened up a new file on him in the meantime, so he had to 
go into hiding during that time).  
Mr. Nejabat had been in prison in the 80s, until 1988. His first sentence was a few-year 
sentence (, but was inexplicably extended for an extra two years. He was in Gohar Dashdt, 
Evin, and Adel Abad prisons throughout his time in detention.  
</p>
<p>He thought he would be executed in 1988, since he heard about other executions. But he 
was released.  
</p>
<p>His wife had also been in prison, and his son was born there. His son is a paraplegic due to 
heat damage to the brain from prison as a young child. 
</p>
<p>In 1992, a new file was opened against him. He fled the country. 
</p>
<p>At one point, a column in <i>Keyhan</i> was written against his current organization&#8217;s work 
abroad.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Mani&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Student 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. &#8220;Mani&#8221; left Iran right before the 2009 election, because he was a PhD student in 
political science and had written about politics before.  
</p>
<p>His father is also in academia and has been politically active and had trouble with 
authorities due to his own expression. Therefore, Mani cannot return to Iran and his father 
cannot leave the country to visit him. 
</p>
<p>His family still gets pressured by security forces because of his own work.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Mansour&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. &#8220;Mansour&#8221; left Iran eight months ago. He was summoned to Intelligence in Tehran a 
few days earlier, probably because he is a fairly outspoken LGBT rights activist. Mansour 
spoke with his lawyer, who advised him that he may be in trouble. His partner has since 
been summoned by authorities.  </p>


<p>He notes that two LGBT parties have been broken up (with arrests) over the past two 
months, whereas there has only been one in the years before.  
</p>
<p>There is a general level of societal tolerance for LGBT individuals in the big cities, 
according to Mansour. Gay people can and do get kicked out of work, etc., but not because 
of that per se, but rather because the employers often don&#8217;t want &#8220;trouble.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>  Ms. Mahnaz  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political prisoner/ LGBT activist 
</b></p>
<p>Ms Mahnaz was arrested in 1981 for political activities and spent one month in an isolated 
cell.  
</p>
<p>In 1984, she was arrested and spent three years at Evin Prison; she was banned from 
leaving the country for 20 years.  
</p>
<p>In 1995, she was arrested again, this time for trying to leave Iran without a passport, in 
violation of her previous travel ban. Authorities had apparently been monitoring her calls, 
and also got to know that she was a lesbian. She was sentenced to a suspended sentence of 
three years in prison for her political activities and to 100 lashes for lesbianism.  
</p>
<p>She then left the country.  
</p>
<p>She points out that Iran is a hetero-normative society, so it tolerates gender-reassignment 
surgery; individuals who really should not be reassigned are often pushed to undergo the 
procedure, sometimes very hastily and without proper prior psychological counseling or 
necessary medical preparation.  
</p>
<p>She does believe that there is a sense amongst the younger generation that &#8220;human rights&#8221; 
can help bolster their quality of life. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Reza&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Labour rights activist 
</b></p>
<p>Mr Reza was condemned to death in 1970 by the Shah, because he was politically active 
outside of the country (as a leftist).  
He returned to Iran three days before the Revolution, for political reasons (he was already 
established abroad otherwise).  
He was arrested three years after the Revolution, and spent seven months in prison with no 
trial. He was not tortured, but authorities were very interested in his political affiliations. He 
was later released, but not permitted to leave the country. He was later able to pay 6 million 
tumans to a member of the Revolutionary Guard in order to have the travel ban lifted. He 
then continued to work in Iran.  
</p>
<p>Mr Reza began running underground guilds of tool-makers and mechanics. He also helped 
organize a network of groups of civil unions. He and other colleagues printed 1,000 or 
1,500 copies of their pamphlet, but they later found out that other people in the country had 
printed out 100,000.  
</p>
<p>In 2010, someone stopped, pulled up beside him in a white van, and officers came out and 
took his watch and his wallet and blindfolded him. He was trying to figure out which route 
they took; he thinks they traveled to the Intelligence Center at Evin Prison.  </p>


<p>This time he was tortured. They would pull chairs out from beneath him, and they beat him 
with an iron rod; they broke one of the bones on the sole of his foot. It seemed that they 
wanted him to admit connections to the MEK, although he had none. He requested medical 
attention for his swollen foot, but instead they put extra pressure on his foot until he lost 
consciousness. They said: &#8220;Ok, now it&#8217;s time for you to cooperate with us.&#8221; They showed 
him a picture of his 80-year-old mother-in-law in his own house, laying on the floor, 
looking like she had been pushed. They threatened to &#8220;destroy&#8221; his life. He agreed to 
cooperate.  
</p>
<p>They put him in a car blindfolded and freed him on the highway. He went to a hospital and 
had his foot plastered (there is permanent damage). About three months later, he managed 
to leave the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Amir Goli  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Student / Kurdish rights activist 
</b></p>
<p>Mr Goli was a student at the faculty of the University at Oroumiyeh. Toward the end of his 
time in Iran, he was with the Democratic Kurdish Student Union, a group that promoted the 
human rights of Kurds.  
</p>
<p>He had been covering a number of Kurdish cases, but in particular he was covering the case 
of Ebrahim Lotfullahi, who was killed by authorities, and another case of death-in-
detention of a Kurdish activist. 
</p>
<p>His mother and elder brother were already in prison at that time. His mother was sentenced 
to two years in prison for belonging to a group called &#8220;Mothers of Peace.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>In late 2008, Amir was still at university, but after a strike by Kurdish prisoners in Iran, 
authorities began to watch him (he had been the organizer of this strike). Authorities came 
to his house and turned his house &#8220;upside-down.&#8221; He first moved around near Sanandaj for 
a month or so, then was practically in a new city every day. He left in the autumn of 2010.  
</p>
<p>Amir would like to mention one particular case, which no human rights groups have 
mentioned. Habibah Tanhayan was killed in detention in 2003 and his body was returned to 
his family unceremoniously, with no explanation of his death.  
</p>
<p><b>  Yaser Goli  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Student Rights Activist 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. Goli was arrested in early 2006 for the first time. He spent 11 days in the Intelligence 
section of Sanandaj. There was not any abuse or torture, but his prison conditions were very 
unsanitary. Upon release was told that he would be able to finish his university degree, 
which he was almost finished with at that point.  
</p>
<p>But after he finished his last course and went to complete his oral exam, he was told that 
because he had been arrested by Intelligence, he should check with them. Intelligence 
officials at the office told him, that undoubtedly that they did not want students who took 
orders from &#8220;foreign influences,&#8221; and that he should &#8220;go get a degree abroad&#8221; if he wanted 
one.  
</p>
<p>The second time he was arrested, in the autumn of 2006, he was beaten up by Intelligence 
officials. One would beat him up, and he would fall into the arms of another, who would 
beat him. They had other prisoners come in and say that they saw him with five pounds of 
bombs strapped to his chest. They asked him to confess to this, but he refused. They then </p>


<p>threatened to bring in his family in to beat them up and well. After 91 days at the 
Intelligence Center, he was transferred to the Sanandaj prison. During this time, he 
encountered Ebrahim Lotfullahi, the Kurdish student activist who later died under 
mysterious circumstance in detention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Fatemeh Goftari  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mother&#8217;s for Peace / Kurdish rights activist 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. Goftari left Iran four years ago. She is the mother of Amir and Yaser Goli.  
</p>
<p>By 2006, one of her sons had fled, one was in prison, and her husband was also in prison, 
&#8220;so they took me to prison as well.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>When her son Yaser had been arrested (in 2006), prison officials called her to ask her to 
come get his possessions. He was to pay his university tuition that day, so he had quite a bit 
of tuition money on him. She told them that her husband would come, but they said no, she 
should come. They told her not to be scared, that she should come to a kiosk and it would 
only take two minutes. She decided she would not go alone, so she took her other son Amir. 
They were not far from the prison when a car pulled up, and she was worried that they were 
there to arrest her son. But they grabbed her neck and tried to arrest her. She told him: 
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, take my bag, I will flee from the other side of the car.&#8221; But there was 
someone blocking the way. They treated her harshly and brought her to the Intelligence 
Center. There, she saw Habibollah Latifi, who was a friend of her son, so she said hello. 
They banged his head against the wall until he bled. From then on, they were fixated on her 
connection with him, although, as she kept telling them, she only knew him because he was 
a friend of her son. They kept her in the Detention Center for eight days and then moved 
her to a prison. She still had not been presented with charges. She was now in a cell with 50 
other women.  
</p>
<p>One morning in the prison she woke up because she heard terrible crying. She asked two 
other women what was going on, and they explained that someone was going to be 
executed. They took her to a bathroom, where they looked through ventilation hole. From 
there, they could see the hanging rope. The person who was going to be hanged was crying. 
They would also threaten her often. They did not beat her body, but did slap her face.  
</p>
<p>After she saw the rope, she decided, along with those two women, that she would embark 
on a hunger strike. This lasted five days, during which she developed a stomach ulcer. So 
she and the other women stopped. Three days after this hunger strike, she was taken to a 
Revolutionary Court. Her trial was five minutes long. At the court, her judge told her: &#8220;You 
are a trouble-maker. Wherever you go, you make trouble.&#8221; The court demanded five millon 
tuman bail.  
</p>
<p>She was sentenced to three years for attacking the Government, in the sense that she had 
insulted them verbally, which was &#8220;true, given the fact that her sons were in prison.&#8221; 
Another charge was signing the One Million Signatures Campaign, and a third for working 
with Mothers for Peace. She did not have access to a lawyer during the trial, and later she 
had trouble finding one who would take her case. But later she did find one, and he got the 
sentence reduced to two years. To this day she has no idea why she was targeted 
(specifically), although she is fairly sure it&#8217;s because of her family&#8217;s convictions and 
because as a member of the Mothers for Peace, they would mourn the deaths of all victims 
of the Government, including members of the political and other groups, without 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Early one the morning in Sanandaj, two months after her release from prison, she went to 
buy bread. Since she had already been to prison, she had a &#8220;sort of sixth-sense,&#8221; and </p>


<p>realized that two people were watching her. She thought this was probably because they 
wanted to arrest her younger son Amir. She went home and warned him, and told him she 
would go to her mother&#8217;s house. Within 50 meters from that house, two gentlemen with 
smoky eyeglasses approached her and grabbed her, one from each side, and told her to go 
to a side street. While they were walking, she was insulting them and trying to make them 
angry. At the same time, she took off her shoes and tried to flee. When she began running, 
one grabbed her overcoat and stopped her. She threw dirt into one of their eyes and ran into 
a public square. She ran into a store and even though the shopkeeper was trying to kick her 
out, she stayed and called her family and told her she was going to go to her brother-in-
law&#8217;s place, 20 minutes from Sanandaj.  
She stayed at her brother&#8217;s house for two days. Her husband and son Amir joined her there, 
and one morning, at 4am, they fled to the Suleiymaniyeh in the Kurdish Regional 
Government, Iraq.

that work nonviolently for the protection of Kurdish rights, although all are operating 
illegally.  
</p>
<p>He noted that dozens of Kurdish political prisoners remain are on death row with sentences 
confirmed by the Supreme Court.

<p>Four of ten remaining Kurdish prisoners are still on death row Jamshid Dehgani, his 
younger brother, Jahangir Dehgani, Hamed Ahmadi, and Kamal Molayee. All were accused 
of involvement in the murder of a Friday Imam, and all have suffered forced confession and 
a lack of due process and forced confession. 
</p>
<p>One of the prisoners is a child and is married. They claim that they have not had any 
contacts with Al-Qaeda, Wahabbis, or other extremists groups, despite the fact that the 
Government has charged them with this. They are &#8220;simply Kurds from Sanandaj.&#8221; They 
were supposedly arrested for events affiliated with a Salafist named Sheikh al-Islam, but in 
reality they were arrested &#8220;before his activities.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>They have been kept in solitary confinement, and apparently endure psychological and 
physical torture. Their trial did not last more than ten minutes. Six of the original ten have 
been executed already. The rest are reportedly in bad condition or sick, including one who 
has convulsions and must take 21 pills per day. </p>

<p>In order to pay the 210 million tuman bail for her after she left the country, her family had

<p><b>  Mithra Tahimi -  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Former leftist political prisoner 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. Mithra Tahimi had been taken prisoner in May 1983, because she was a member of the 
Tudeh Party (a secret branch). She was arrested at home by the Revolutionary Guards. She 
was taken to a Joint Committee, which is now a museum. She was subject to interrogation 
for one month and held at the temporary detention center for a full year. In 1984, she was 
sent to Evin Prison. The charge was that she had worked with others to foment a coup 
against the Islamic Republic, which was &#8220;completely untrue. &#8220;She had been tortured and 
beaten during interrogation to admit this, but not as badly as higher-ranking members of the 
party (two of them were actually killed, although the official story is that they committed 
suicide. One of them was Rahman Hatifi). When she was being interrogated, they 
constantly threatened her with execution, which she knew was unlikely given the lack of 
evidence for charges. Then they told her that if she confessed on television she would 
receive a lighter sentence. 
</p>
<p>She was taken to court in May 1985 and sentenced to 15 years in prison after a trial lasting 
no more than 10 minutes. There were only two men in the room. It was &#8220;more like an 
interrogation than a trial.&#8221; She protested, but to no avail. No evidence was presented against 
her. They wanted to know why there was a secret wing of the Tudeh Party. (The Tudeh 
Party still supported the Islamic Republic officially). 
She spent her sentence mostly in Evin Prison, with six months at Ghezel Hesar in the 
middle of the sentence. 
</p>
<p>In 1988, a number of male members of the Tudeh Party were executed. Ms Tahimi was 
taken to court again at that time and re-tried, as were many members of Tudeh. Many of the 
men were sentenced to death, while the women received lashing sentences. A number of 
women whose sentences had been dually served were not released, because authorities still 
wanted to extract confessions. In her cell block, the first floor was reserved for those whose 
sentences were completed. The second was for those who had &#8220;repented,&#8221; and the third was 
for those still serving sentences. Women from the first floor were often taken to 
&#8220;repentance&#8221; rooms. She herself was required to pray; if she did not, they would accuse her 
of apostasy.  
</p>
<p>A few months before she was taken for her re-trial, it seemed that some of the prison 
officials had been released, and they were no longer lashing women. Some women had by 
that point been released, but she had no way of knowing how many, since they secretly 
shuffled people around the prison. 
</p>
<p>In September of 1988, they took seven women -- five from the bottom floor and two from 
the top floor. She thought she was going for another interrogation, but they took them to 
court. The women had already decided that if they threatened them with apostasy charges 
they would threaten a dry hunger strike. When they got to the court, she was blindfolded. A 
male voice told her to take her blindfold off. The same judge who had previously sentenced 
her was there, along with the prison discipline officer. The judge asked her whether she still 
belonged to the Tudeh party; she said yes. Was her father in the party? &#8220;No&#8221;. Do you pray? </p>


<p>No. &#8220;Well then,&#8221; the judge said, &#8220;the penalty for apostasy is lashing to death.&#8221; They said 
she would be lashed five times for each of the five times per day she refused to pray (which 
she notes was interesting, since in Shi&#8217;a Islam they only pray three times per day), until she 
would sign a document verifying that she was a Muslim and prayed. When she was first 
arrested, and for the bulk of her imprisonment, questions revolved around Marxism 
leanings, but in 1988 they focused on whether or not the prisoners considered themselves 
Muslims.  
</p>
<p>In 1990, she was conditionally released -- but not fully released -- from prison. She had 
been in prison for eight years.  
</p>
<p>She left Iran in 1994.

<p><b>  Former political prisoner / advocate for Ayatollah Boroujerdi 
</b>Ms. &#8220;Noura&#8221; came to discuss the case of Ayatollah Boroujerdi.  
She claims that the Supreme Leader is denying him necessary medical help. Ms. Noura 
claims that the Supreme Leader has contacted Ayatollah Boroujerdi directly. She also 
claims that prison officials have told Mr. Boroujerdi directly that if he does not write a 
letter recanting his beliefs, he will never be released.  
</p>
<p>Since last autumn, the situation of Mr. Boroujerdi has worsened. Authorities have increased 
their pressure on him to sign confession letters and have called and pressured his wife and 
family to pressure him to sign in turn.  
</p>
<p>His supporters have asked for the European Parliament delegation to intervene on his 
behalf. They have also asked others to intervene, but they have not been successful.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Noura herself was in prison. She was a college lecturer, and established a center in 
physical/neuro-chemistry. She was very successful, but because of her political beliefs 
(liberal) she was exiled to work in a small library. When she returned to university, she was 
also pushed not to work with certain people. She then tried to establish a journal, and even 
then when her articles were published, authorities censored her name from journals.  
She began working with Ayatollah Boroujerdi, and in 2006, when her son was a baby, 
authorities attacked her home at night and arrested her. Her mother had heart problems, and 
after that suffered from a heart attack.  
</p>
<p>She left the country two years ago.

</p>
<p>Since 2006, she has herself been taken to prison four times. Once, while she was on the 
phone with her father, notifying him of her arrest, she was slapped and she screamed. In 
response, her father had a heart attack and required open-heart surgery.  </p>

<p>Mr. Kermanshahi notes that in April 2013, 15 to 20 LGBT individuals at a party in 
Kermanshah were arrested. All were freed within one week to ten days of arrest.  
</p>
<p>Some were released on bail and their court cases are constantly being delayed. Some of the 
individuals were physically harmed, but most were verbally insulted for being gay. Many of 
their families have also come under pressure due to their being gay.  
</p>
<p>Revolutionary Guards also lectured them and told them to come to lectures so that they 
could be &#8220;put on the right path.&#8221; Those individuals, therefore, and others at the party, are 
still living in an atmosphere of fear.  
</p>
<p>Gender-reassignment surgeries occur because the Islamic Republic views homosexuality as 
a sickness. Social and family norms do not help, as families often cooperate with the

<p>Ms. &#8220;Maryam&#8221; would like to point out that the families of those individuals executed in the 
1980s still suffer today. Many people in Iran and elsewhere feel that this issue is a &#8220;thing of 
the past,&#8221; but the pressure against the families continues to this day.  
</p>
<p>For years the families have been questioned and harassed. They are sometimes threatened 
by authorities with prison time as well. Despite this, they continue to go to Khavaran, to 
pay respects to their dead. Of course they do not know the circumstances of the deaths of 
their loved ones, or even if they were buried at Khavaran, but it has become an important 
symbol and place of remembrance.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Maryam herself was summoned by authorities in within the past four years. She was

<p>Recently, in a school in Kurdistan, a stove caught fire. Two students died and 30 students 
were burned, and the Government reportedly prevented some donations of people in the 
community from reaching the victims&#8217; families. Some prominent Iranians also wanted to 
visit the region (including artists) but were prevented from visiting. Shazram Nazeri, an 
Iranian singer, apparently organized a benefit concert which raised 52 million tuman, but </p>


<p>she was apparently unable to transmit the proceeds to the victims as well. When family 
members protested, they were arrested for 24 hours for &#8220;causing trouble.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Families have received only a total of 600,000 tumans for their medical costs. One report 
also surfaced that money was sent from Germany but was also not transmitted to the 
victims.  
</p>
<p>In a separate case, in demonstrations following the self-immolation of three members of the 
Yarasan minority in 2013, 30 people were arrested and many of their locations are still 
unknown.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ms. &#8220;Bahareh&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Wife of current political detainee 
</b></p>
<p>Both she and her husband left Iran over 10 years ago.  
</p>
<p>Within the past two years, she went to Iran with her son from abroad, where she had been 
living. During that time, nothing happened, but as she was about to leave, they took her 
passport and interrogated her four times. She was mostly questioned about her husband&#8217;s 
activities and statements in foreign media. 
</p>
<p>Her husband started to be politically active at the age of 14. In 2012, he received a letter 
from authorities that he was not permitted to leave Iran (he was already abroad though at 
this point). No reason for the travel ban was listed on the letter, so he consulted a lawyer, 
and the lawyer implied that he should not get involved in such things.  
</p>
<p>Recently, she and her husband did go back, along with their nine-year-old son, to Iran. Her 
husband had not been back to Iran since the events of 2009; he agreed to go back &#8220;because 
of President Rouhani&#8217;s pledges.&#8221; But hers and his passports were taken away. She and her 
son were eventually able to come back to their home abroad, but he is still in Iran.  
</p>
<p>When they were in Iran, they were interrogated once together, but he was summoned three 
more times. The accusations against him are propaganda against the regime and 
interviewing with foreign media He was told of his charges orally.  
</p>
<p>He was not tortured or mistreated during interrogations.  
</p>
<p>He is now free on bail; his father guaranteed a large bail amount in order to secure his 
release.  
</p>
<p>Intelligence officials promised him that he would be permitted to leave the country, as long 
as his father continues to pay the bail. However, in reality, officials did not give his 
passport back to him, and he now has a new trial summons. 
</p>
<p>They did agree with the authorities not to speak about the case to others, but after a few 
months, Iranian state press wrote about his case on its own. 
</p>
<p><b>  Massoud Nour-Mohammadi  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political activist 
</b></p>
<p>He is 29-years-old. He was arrested in 2009 after the post-election events. His brother had 
been arrested in 2009, and authorities did not notify the family of the charges initially or 
allow visits. During the election events, there were rumors that Mr. Moussavi and Kraroubi 
would be arrested. He received an SMS that in case of arrest, he and other Green 
Movement supporters would all meet at a certain square. He was arrested for allegedly 
passing this text on to others.  </p>


<p>He worked at a computer shop. Authorities came to his place of work, and searched his 
computers there. They then went to his home, confiscated both of his personal computers, 
and took him to Evin Prison. He was at Evin Prison for 16 days, and was interrogated three 
times. The first time was short, but the third time it began at 8am and lasted until 4 or 5pm. 
During the stay in solitary confinement, he was allowed to bathe only twice per week, and 
there was no possibility to go outside. The only three times he was removed from solitary 
confinement was for interrogation. He had no contact with his family during that time and 
no one knew where he was.  
</p>
<p>On the eve of the 16th day, he was transferred from solitary confinement to Section 240. 
There were always between three and six people in his cell there. He stayed there for 15 
days and was freed on the 31st day of prison. He later came to know that family friends had 
put 20 million tuman down in bail for his freedom.  
</p>
<p>In March 2010, he received a letter stating that he had to go to court, in order for them to 
review his case, and then the date was changed to July. He went to court with his lawyer. 
The whole case took &#8220;maybe seven minutes.&#8221; His lawyer argued that he did not need to go 
to prison for what he was arrested for, but a week later he received notice of a three-year 
prison sentence. He appealed, and a week later the sentence was confirmed at an appellate 
court. He decided to leave the country.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Member of the National Front Party 
</b></p>
<p>Mr Reza has been a member since 1382 (2003-2004). He would like to speak about two 
cases. The first case is of Mr. Abbas Amir Intizam, who was the spokesperson of the 
provisional government right after the Revolution, and was then a political prisoner for 32 
years. Two years ago, due to illness, authorities allowed him to go home periodically and 
return to prison. He feels that this case has been forgotten by the human rights community, 
so he wanted to recall it. Mr. Intizam is 78-years-old.  
</p>
<p>The second case is Mr. Goutan Dawlati, who is in charge of the student section of the 
National Front. He was arrested around December of 2012 for activities against national 
security and for being a member of the National Front. He had been on hunger strike for 22 
days as of the time of this interview. He is very ill; he has a heart ailment and must take 
pills five times per day. At the beginning, the prison said they would not pay for his stay at 
a hospital because it was too expensive; his family then offered to pay but that was refused. 
Amnesty International issued an urgent appeal on this case last week (December 2013).  
This third case is of Abul Fazl Abedini, a member of the pan-Iranist party and a journalist. 
He was arrested in 1388 (2009 - 2010) and spent three years at Evin Prison. He was beaten 
badly, which was documented. He has now been exiled to Karoun prison in Ahwaz for the 
past year. He is also in bad medical condition, but has not been permitted to access 
necessary medical care.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ms. &#8220;Yazdani&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Lawyer in Iran / human rights defender 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. &#8220;Yazdani&#8221; has been a lawyer for more than ten years. She has worked on dozens of 
cases in the Revolutionary Courts. </p>


<p>The Bill of Formal Attorneyship was amended under President Ahmadinejad to strip 
independence of the Bar by the judiciary, according to Ms. Yazdani. However, the 
Government responded that it could not be amended. 
</p>
<p>But the bill remained in the Parliament and is now back with the judiciary. She is worried 
that the same issue may arise.  
</p>
<p>She would also like to discuss the election for the President of the Bar Association. All 
candidates must be vetted and approved by the high Disciplinary Court for judges. In 2011, 
28 out of 118 candidates were disqualified. In 2009, 36 of 79 were disqualified. This year, 
there are 116 candidates, and many lawyers are worried that the same thing will happen. 
The reason she is highlighting this case is because the recent EU delegation in Iran met 
with the current President of the Bar Association, but that person is not independent; it is 
very important that independent voices be heard.  
</p>
<p>The major issue for lawyers in Iran is their general lack of immunity. A number of lawyers 
are sentenced to imprisonment or to a cash fine each year for insulting the judge or 
disrupting order in the court.  
</p>
<p>There is never a member of the bar association permitted to examine whether such charges 
are based on reality or due to the judge&#8217;s personal enmity with the lawyer.  
In addition to all of this, the judges &#8220;have too much power in Iran,&#8221; and lawyers are always 
denigrated in the court. This is worse for women; the hijab is a way to humiliate female 
lawyers.&#8221; When women lawyers raise an objection, sometimes judges will counter that the 
hijab is not sitting properly, in front of everyone, in order to humiliate them. Authorities 
also check lawyers at the entrance of the court room for &#8220;proper hijab.&#8221; 
In political cases she represented (at the Revolutionary Courts), the following are issues 
which restrained her ability to present a full / proper defense: 
</p>
<p>Lawyers are restricted in terms of reading dossiers and presenting proper defenses. Lawyers 
are sometimes threatened that they may themselves receive political charges. In one case, 
when she tried to defend her client, the judge told her to save her defense of her &#8220;own 
case,&#8221; and accused her of defending the MEK. In the case of students who were attacked in 
their dorms in 2009, when she requested a writ from the investigative agent (which is 
legal), he told the court guards to refuse her entrance, which they did.  
Her clients are sometimes coerced to admit to charges, with methods not related to judicial 
process.  
</p>
<p>After the 2009 elections, lawyers were not permitted to enter the courtrooms in many cases.  
</p>
<p>Lawyers and clients are often forced to wait for long periods. 
</p>
<p>Lawyers are also not able to visit their clients before the trial, or sometimes after the trial.  
</p>
<p>Lawyers often do not receive the written rulings, so that they can appeal if necessary.  
</p>
<p>Another issue is the expulsion of law professors. Since the election of President Rouhani, 
the situation of universities for current professors is better. However, the original expelled 
lawyers, including Dr. Mohammed Sharif and Dr. Mohammadi Ghorbani, have not been 
reinstated.  
</p>
<p>In all types&#8217; of cases, political and civil, torture exists, and the right of defense of the client 
is not respected, although due process provisions are in the Criminal Code of Procedure.  
</p>
<p>In the case of drug offenders, they are deprived of &#8220;any humane treatment whatsoever.&#8221; 
They are brought to the court in 10s and 20s in a bus, all in handcuffs and shackled 
together. They are forced to sit in the corridor in the Revolutionary Courts in a very 
difficult position. They do not have any chance to clean themselves in detention; the </p>


<p>Revolutionary Courts always smell because of it. Their trials never last more than a few 
minutes and their cases are not examined by the courts but by the court secretary. Sentences 
are always heavy. &#8220;Seeing them always reminds me of the times of slavery.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>In the case of women who have been raped: according to Iranian law, women who 
complain may be accused of having illicit relations if they cannot prove their charges. The 
process for examining cases is very wrong and denigrating, especially with regard to the 
tests that are carried out, including virginity tests. The victim has to explain in minute detail 
everything that has happened to her, in front of five male judges in the court, a prosecutor, 
lawyer, and relatives of the victim. The accused is in court and must explain to everyone in 
public what happened.  
</p>
<p>Those who are convicted and actually executed for rape are mostly gangs who rape. For 
example, a gang called the &#8220;Black Vultures&#8221; were arrested after having raped 50 people. In 
practice, singular instances of rape are not prosecuted successfully. In cases where a woman 
goes to court accusing others of rape, if she cannot prove it, she can then be tried for 
adultery.  
</p>
<p>Regarding the Islamic Penal Code: <i>Moharebeh</i> and <i>efsed fil-arz (corruption on earth)</i> 
remain tools of repression. She would like to refer also to Article 220 of the New Code, 
which states that where the law is silent, the judge can consult Shari&#8217;a-based text. This 
provision also exists in the Constitution. Before the New Penal Code, the Supreme Court 
would often say that this provision concerns only civil cases and the Criminal Procedure 
Code, so they would throw out cases where the judge did not have a different reason. Now 
they can no longer do that.  
</p>
<p>Articles 120 and 121 of the New Penal Code state that in cases of &#8220;doubt,&#8221; judges should 
not issue guilty sentences. But, there are exceptions for <i>Moharebeh</i> and e<i>fsed fil-arz.</i>  
Another change -- to the detriment of defendants -- in the New Penal Code is that 
previously defendants could receive suspended sentences, but now all security-related (and 
some other) cases may not receive suspended sentences and do not enjoy a statute of 
limitations.  
</p>
<p>She does note that under the previous code, if anyone committed any sort of <i>Moharebeh</i> 
and e<i>fsed fil-arz, </i>they would be sentenced to death. Now, there is a new category of the 
Penal Code which only provides for a death sentence if the accused carried a weapon and 
used it. In the past, membership in an organization was enough. But then all defendants 
who were previously sentenced to death, including members of the MEK or Peyjak, should 
now be able to ask for a retrial. But despite the efforts of their lawyers, the courts have not 
permitted retrials. The Kurdish man who was executed in September along with the 
Baluchis, for example, was sentenced to death based only on a photo of him with a weapon.

<p><b>  Behya Jailani 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human rights activist / former prisoner 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. Jailani was arrested in 1998 during the events at the University of Tehran. She was 
arrested with Ms. Ebadi, Mehrengiz Kar, Mr. Lahiji, and others. She was tortured in the 
presence of these people. She has brought documents and newspaper clippings about this 
mistreatment, which was widely reported on, because she had been in France for a long 
time as a PhD student and sociologist. She went back to Iran in 1998 only at the invitation 
of an activist.  
</p>
<p>She brought some notes from her trial. She was in prison for 4.5 years. She was kept in 
solitary confinement in a cell that was 1x1.5 meters. She was subject to &#8220;white torture 24&#8221; 
hours per day (with constant intrusive or insulting music, for example).  </p>


<p>Today, economic problems in Iran have destroyed the social fabric. Drug use by women is 
common, whereas this was not the case in the past. There are husbands who push their 
wives into prostitution. When she was in prison, she was with a 21-year-old woman who 
told her that her husband was bringing other men to the house in order to force her into 
prostitution, and that she became pregnant by another man, at which point the husband 
accused her of adultery. When she was in Iran, she recalls a place called Bahar where the 
Government would bring street children. It was supposed to be an educational center for 
them, but there was very little supervision, and the children often fled. She claims that some 
of the girls taken to prostitution or e even sold by Government officials or their own fathers 
to Gulf Arab men.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mahin Shokrullah-Pour 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Former political prisoner / husband killed 
</b></p>
<p>Both she and her husband have been active for Kurdish parties and in prison. Her husband 
was in prison for 3.5 years. Due to having been in prison, they were cut off from social 
opportunities in Iran, and her husband had to work as a freelancer.  
</p>
<p>Both of them were put in prison in 1365 (1986). Her husband, Mr. Farahman Sadegh 
Vaziri, who was detained at the Sanandaj Intelligence Detention Center, had been released 
after the executions of 1988. He had actually been sentenced to death, but at the time, there 
was the possibility of buying a commutation to a life-sentence.  
</p>
<p>They both thought that life would get better after release, but even after he was released, he 
had to report to authorities once per week. Moreover, they had children, and those children 
were subject to pressure. For example, at school, if her son was at the top of the class, he 
would never be officially at the top of the class, as he would be excluded from the list. The 
same happened to her daughter.  
</p>
<p>In 2003, they decided to leave the country due to this pressure. They made it to Oroumiyeh, 
but there they were arrested by authorities. They were taken away in a two-car convoy. 
There was a Revolutionary Guard in the front of the car, and she was trying to explain that 
they had just come for a summer picnic. He replied: &#8220;If it were up to me I would just let 
you go right now, but the guys in the front car are in charge.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>They were taken to the Sarmaz Intelligence police center. Her son was 16 and her daughter 
was eight-years-old at the time. Officials told them not to worry; that there was a simple 
&#8220;price&#8221; for &#8220;what they wanted to do across the border&#8221;: 30 million tumans. Then they took 
her husband away, and left her and her son handcuffed to chairs (her daughter was able to 
walk around).  
However, the next morning, when her husband was brought out and she tried to approach 
him, the guards restrained her. She could tell that something was wrong. All of a sudden, 
the bribe offer was off of the table, and they were taken to court and then to the public 
prison at Sarmaz (for common criminals). She was worried about her son since this 
province was known for heroin; she assumed that there would also be drugs in the prison. 
Everyone was being interrogated every day. What she &#8220;didn&#8217;t know was that [her]&#8221; 
husband had been subjected to harsh torture and was being brought back in front of her son 
every day.  
</p>
<p>When she saw her husband for days later, he was unrecognizable and did not respond to her 
calls in the courtyard. He was being dragged along and his shoulders and arms were 
slumped. She began to scream and asked the guards what they had done to her; they denied 
having anything to do with it and said that that&#8217;s &#8220;how he is.&#8221; </p>


<p>The next day, they were taken for fingerprinting. She had been involved in political activity 
before, so it was no problem for her, but she was upset when they tried to fingerprint her 
daughter. They told her that they finger-printed her husband and son as well. This &#8220;put her 
over the edge&#8221;; she did not understand why children should be put into the system as 
&#8220;criminals&#8221; when they just obeyed their parents and came with them for a ride.  
It had only been seven days when authorities told her that her husband had died.  
</p>
<p>Her son had known about this and a guard had apparently allowed him to call family, so 
already two days after she found out family from both sides had arrived. They told her to 
stay quiet or else they would not even give them the body. She was also concerned that she 
and her children would be released, so she complied. They were released on bail and told to 
report to the Intelligence Center in Sanandaj 40 days later. They gave them the body, and 
they went back to Sanandaj. The body bore marks of physical abuse, and a doctor who 
looked at the body said that it appeared that a chemical which speeds up decomposition was 
used.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>They were warned not to publicize his death or hold a ceremony, but her husband was so 
well-known in the city that people lined the streets when they returned, despite the presence 
of Revolutionary Guards. Her husband was killed at the same at Ms. Zahra Kazemi, a 
famous case, but their case did not receive any attention, &#8220;perhaps because we are Kurds.&#8221; 
The death is still very much with them, especially with her son.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The sentence that had been handed down to them (for trying to exit the country illegally) 
was for all four family members, so she consulted a lawyer about the status of the sentence 
given the death of her husband, and she was informed that they could be brought back into 
detention at any time.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>She decided to leave the country. For psychological reasons, she did not want to leave 
through the same border again, so they arranged for someone to pick them up and take them 
to Marivan, in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
</p>
<p>She believes that a local commander was excited to report the &#8220;capture of Kumaleh 
activists,&#8221; and that guards abused her husband.  
</p>
<p><b>  Hassan (Jamal) Poorkarim  
  Journalist / Kurdish rights activist 
</b></p>
<p>In Iran, he worked at weekly publication called<i> Nedayeh Jameh</i> (Persian) / <i>Deni 
Kumaliyeah</i> (Kurdish); this was licensed under President Khatami. They also had a Kurdish 
linguistic center. After two years of publication, he was arrested and detained at an 
Intelligence Center for 45 days. He was released on 20 million tuman bail and fled with his 
wife to Iraqi Kurdistan. (The editor-in-chief is also now released, but the editor-in-chief of 
another publication with which they worked -- <i>Payam E-Mardam</i> -- is still in prison).  
When they ran the language institute, more than 1,000 students enrolled to study, and the 
students themselves were also put under pressure. After Mr. Poorkarim was imprisoned, 
Mr. Abdullah Abbasi took over the school. He was run over with a van belonging to the 
Revolutionary Guards and killed. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Poorkarim would also like draw attention to the situation of pollution in the Kurdish 
provinces, which is increasingly becoming dangerous for the local population.  </p>


<p>Finally he would like to raise the issue of the Kulbars, who are still being shot at by Iranian 
guards in large numbers, and of the land mines in the region, which have still not been 
cleared by the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ms. &#8220;Suha&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Association for Kurds living in France  
</b></p>
<p>Women in Iran face discrimination due to Islamic Sharia law in the country, but it is worse 
in Kurdistan because of local and tribal practices, and well as the lack of economic 
development in the region. There is a very high rate of self-immolation suicides of Kurdish 
women. Most girls in the rural areas do not go to school, and many girls are married off at 
very young ages.  
</p>
<p>Many other Kurdish women are themselves Kulbars. There is also a very high divorce rate 
among Kurds, and she would say that one of the reasons for this is the very bad social 
situation in Iran, including high rates of addiction to drugs.  
</p>
<p>There is also a high rate of prostitution in Kurdistan, even though it is against tradition of 
the region.  
</p>
<p>Women additionally face political repression, although this is partly the result of &#8220;positive 
&#8220;integration developments. It is true that there are now women in the Kurdish associations 
in the region, which is a sign of integration, but they in turn, face political repression as part 
of the general &#8220;denigration&#8221; of Kurds by the Iranian Government. There are a number of 
Kurdish political parties that have now taken up arms, which then means that female 
political prisoners are treated more harshly, even if they are merely affiliated with these 
organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Kazem&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Association for Kurds living in France 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. &#8220;Kazem&#8221; would like to draw attention to the &#8220;horrendous&#8221; condition of human rights 
for Kurds in Iran. Even those protections which are theoretically provided in the 
Constitution to others are not provided to Kurds. Kurds who are accused of combatting the 
regime through violent -- physical or civil -- activities are automatically sentenced to death.  
</p>
<p>He would also like to discuss the economic situation of the region. There are six members 
of Parliament representing the Kurdish regions who have recently resigned in protest over 
what they claim is a lack of sufficient budget allocation to the Kurdistan Province. For the 
past year, two percent of the budget was allocated to the Province; in the coming year, it 
will be 0.7%. The province of Kermanshah is also facing budget cuts.  
</p>
<p>The cultural rights of Kurds are suppressed since they are not permitted to published at all 
in Kurdish and must use Persian for all administrative affairs.  
</p>
<p>Finally, although the official unemployment rate in Kurdistan in listed as 20%, it is much 
higher in reality.  </p>


<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Hassan&#8221;

</b></p>
<p>A UN delegation went to Iran in 2003, and prior to that visit there had been calls for the 
release of an activist (Sasson Arekan-An), but he was executed the day the delegation 
arrived.  
</p>
<p>The Government &#8220;plays with Kurdish political prisoners in Iran&#8221; like this.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Shirko Mo&#8217;aerfi was told he was going to be executed 10 times. He was transferred a 
number of times and underwent a mock execution before being executed in the autumn of 
</p><p>2013. Iraqi Kurdistan&#8217;s President Jalal Talabani intervened and his execution was 
suspended, but then reinstated and carried out.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Authorities are still playing with Messrs. Zanyar and Loghman Moradi, for example.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>There was a Revolutionary Guard Colonel named Mr. Hiva Tab who was himself executed 
this year. This man had been known to have killed numerous Kurds, but there was no trial 
or official complaint being pursued against him so his execution is shrouded in mystery; 
they feel he may have actually been executed as the result of a private or tribal dispute.  
</p>
<p>There are 28 political prisoners on death row in Kurdistan at the moment.  
</p>
<p><b>   &#8220;Siamak Namatabi&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Artist / 2009 green movement activist 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. &#8220;Namatabi&#8221; from Tehran, was arrested during the February (Ashura) 2010 election 
protests after being beaten badly. He did not go straight to prison; instead he was taken to a 
hospital. He remained there for seven days, and had his broken nose set. He was taken to 
Section 204 (with mostly Kurds who had been arrested for Students&#8217; Day), whereas most 
other Ashura protestors had been taken to Section 7. After just a few hours he was moved 
to Section 204. The cell to which he was moved to, was meant to be a solitary cell, but he 
was squeezed in with five people (with one toilet and sink) and too few sleeping areas.  
He was interrogated three times; the first time was only seven days into his sentence so he 
had been getting nervous. The first time he was interrogated was from 9am to 3pm. The 
person asked him very general questions, and did not seem to know who he was. The 
interrogator was kind, according to Mr. &#8220;Namatabi&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>The second time the interrogator wanted him to admit that he was involved in the protests, 
but they had no photos of him. It became clear they had no evidence, so he maintained that 
he was not involved. 
</p>
<p>The third time they brought in a photo of someone else that they said was him, but it was a 
fake photo, so he disputed it.  
</p>
<p>When they read his charges to him in court (72 days into prison), he denied being involved 
in the protests. He said he was just walking by and was a simple worker. He did not have a 
lawyer at that time, because authorities and even lawyers of some of his friends 
recommended that he not get a lawyer: &#8220;Having a lawyer will just make things more 
difficult for you.&#8221; Unfortunately, according to Mr. &#8220;Namatabi&#8221;, this was &#8220;unfortunately 
true&#8221; for others.  
</p>
<p>He feels that he was convicted and sentenced because there was a sense that he had been in 
prison for 72 days and so should be punished or have something hanging over his head, in </p>


<p>the minds of authorities. The judge in his case read a statement from the interrogator when 
he issued his sentencing.  
</p>
<p>He left Iran in July-August 2010. It was one month after he received his first verdict, and 
had demanded an appeal.  
</p>
<p>In September 2010 he received a call from his mother who said that his appeal was rejected 
and that he received a two-year prison sentence and lashes. Authorities called his parents 
and they told them he was away studying in Europe, where he decided to stay.

<p><b>  Jaleh Razmi (Tabrizi)  
  Azerbaijani rights activist 
</b></p>
<p>Ms. Ramzi is the ethnic minorities&#8217; representative and a co-founder of Sudwind. She is a 
human rights activist from the Azerbaijani minority and from the Ahl-E-Haq (Yarsan) 
religion.  
</p>
<p>President Rouhani made a lot of pledges to the Azerbaijanis in the election, and as a result 
they voted for him <i>en masse</i>. For example, he promised to open Azerbaijani cultural rights 
center, and told them: &#8220;You will no longer need to fill Lake Oroumiyeh with your tears; I 
will fill it with water!&#8221;  
</p>
<p>However, since then the situation has gotten worse. He appointed Mr. Ali Younessi as 
Governor of the Province, and he has been bad for the people. The prisons are still full, and 
&#8220;nothing has changed.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Azerbaijanis are a peaceful people; they &#8220;do not use violence...&#8221; 
The Yarsan is a religion, just like Baha&#8217;is and Dervishes. Until recently, no one spoke about 
them, and they themselves did not raise their issue. But given the recent self-immolations, 
she herself, even &#8220;even as a secular person,&#8221; has decided to speak about it.  
</p>
<p>There are 4 million Yarsan in Iran. Many have been forced to convert to Islam, and indeed, 
some have. Recently, when one Yarsan man was made to shave his mustache in jail three 
people Hamedan and Kermanshah self-immolated; one in front of Parliament who died.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Mehdi Ghasemzadi was also recently executed.  
</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation of human rights defenders in Iran, the situation is very 
difficult. She, for instance, cannot go back to Iran and her family faces pressure. 
</p>
<p>The Azerbaijanis are facing cultural repression; they cannot use their own language, their 
Turkish names, and their street names are changed in Tabriz and elsewhere. 
</p>
<p><b>  Simi Sabri  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijani rights activist 
</b>Ms. Sabri has come to look at the question of minorities through the lens of a psychologist, 
especially the issue of mother tongues.  
</p>
<p>Iran, for academics of her school of thought, is like &#8220;a big prison for mother tongues.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The Azerbaijanis are not a violent group; they never have been. But the Government also 
suppresses their voices, as with other minorities, and censors much of what they have to say 
in the news.  </p>


<p>She believes that half of the current Azerbaijani political prisoners are detained for 
protesting the drying up of Lake Oroumiyeh. Another large portion are a group of 
supporters of the Tractor football team, and were arrested after a game this summer. 
Usually during the game there are insults chanted between both sides, with the Azerbaijanis 
being treated as separatists and called &#8220;donkeys.&#8221; Azerbaijanis in turn chant: &#8220;mother 
tongue is a right for everybody.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>In one particular case, an Azerbaijani guitar player was sent to prison for six months. For 
the case of Saeed Matinpour, who has a heart ailment in prison, she organized a campaign 
for him along with Amnesty International; within hours they had over 2,000 signatures. 
</p>
<p>A last group arrest she would like to mention is when, on the one-year anniversary 
celebrations of partial self-rule, five people were arrested. One was beaten so badly that his 
ribs were broken and he was sent to the hospital.  
</p>
<p><b>  Khabat Ghorbani  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Kurdish rights activist / journalist 
</b>Both of his parents are Kurdish. He was born in a village called Karagol. On 25 January 
1983, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Basijis attacked his village and killed 18 people, 
from ages 12 to 95-years-old. Soon after, 68 people were killed in another village.  
</p>
<p>His organization has produced a documentary on this issue; there are also still many 
witnesses alive who can confirm this case.  
</p>
<p>Between the Revolution and 1988, altogether around hundreds of people were killed in 
Kurdish villages in such campaigns. Mostly they were not members of political parties; 
&#8220;their only crime was being Kurdish.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>In his own case: Soon after the Revolution he saw the fighting begin between the Kurds and 
the Islamic forces. He was in Mahabad, and there were clashes every day. Iranian forces 
were bombarding Kurdish cities from 1979 to 1983.  
</p>
<p>In the summer of 1982, there had been a two-day conflict between the Government and 
Kurds in Mahabad. One of bombs fell into one of his neighbors&#8217; homes, and their son was 
injured. After he went by to help, he was also injured. His leg is still not fully functional. 
He was in the hospital for 21 days. He was first in a room with six people in the hospital; 
four of them died. After ten days, he was removed to another room with three people; two 
of them died. In the 21 days he was hospitalized, at least 70% of those who came through 
were killed.  
</p>
<p>He was also discriminated against at University. He had been accepted, but then he 
received a letter saying he was &#8220;not suitable according to the Islamic Government&#8221; to study.  
</p>
<p>After 1988, there was a &#8220;Cultural Revolution&#8221; in Iran and he was able to go to school for 
Applied Physics. However, he was a part of a protest and was eventually expelled from 
school. He fled to Iraq and later came to Europe.

<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Hamed&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Former high-ranking politician of the Islamic Republic / former prisoner 
</b></p>
<p>Mr. &#8220;Hamed&#8221; was released from Raja&#8217;i Shahr Prison many years ago. There are prisoners 
there who require urgent medical care, including Mr. Afhsin Barimani, Mr. Siamak Mehr, 
and Mr Saeed Abedini. Of course Mr. Mansourat Pour and Mr. Osanloo died while prison.  </p>


<p>There are some cases, like that of Mr. Mehr Ronavi at Raja&#8217;i Shahr, who cannot be treated 
in prison, so they will die if they are not released. He also spent time at Evin Prison 
however, and would like to point out that conditions there are also bad for people who 
require medical attention, as are other prisons.  
</p>
<p>All of the wardens with whom he has had contact since he was in prison believe that the 
political prisoners are &#8220;against Islam&#8221; and so deserve to die by extension. &#8220;To them, each 
prisoner who dies is less of a strain on the security system.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Aide to the Former Presidential Campaign of Mir Hossein Moussavi 
</p>
<p>Both Mr. Moussavi and Mr. Karroubi suffer from different health problems, in large part 
due to the conditions of their detention. They do not have proper light or ventilation, or 
nutrition.  
</p>
<p>They do not often speak of the health issues in public, in order not to affect the &#8220;morale of 
the Iranian people.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Ms. Rahnavard is also having heart palpitations. All are &#8220;victims of aggression,&#8221; and are 
therefore suffering. Over the past 20 days, for example (December 2013), Moussavi, 
Karroubi, and Rahnavard have been threatened with execution. They have a sense that 
authorities are probing general opinion in Iran in order to take &#8220;some steps,&#8221; but they are 
not sure what those steps are.  
</p>
<p>Authorities have tried to justify their detention by making it look like a provisional 
disciplinary detention.  
</p>
<p>They are also being constantly monitored. The monitoring of people&#8217;s lives, overall, is a big 
problem in Iran; it is an invasion of privacy. His own house was bugged (including his 
bathroom and bedroom) for two weeks.  
The environment is another big problem in Iran. People are dying every day from negative 
environmental effects.  
</p>
<p>As someone who was involved in the original drafting of the Civil Rights Charter under 
President Khatami, he could tell you that the current draft has nothing to do with the 
original version; in a way, &#8220;it&#8217;s like a denunciation of our work.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>He does believe that the current international dialogue is positive, if not at least because it 
highlights and brings to the fore the &#8220;differences between the Judiciary and the 
Government.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>High-Ranking Official of the National Front 
</p>
<p>He would like to make three points: he has been in prison for 15 years during different 
period in the history of the Islamic Republic. In Iran, the &#8220;Judicial authorities and the 
Parliament do not follow the same system as the Government. &#8220;So sometimes in order to 
assert authority or to prove a point, they crack down on activists &#8220;in spite of the intentions 
of the Government. This happened under former President Khatami as well. 
</p>
<p>Some of the members of his movement, like Massoud Pedram, Keyvan Samimi, Ahmad 
Aeydabadi, and Emad Bahadabar are still in prison.  
</p>
<p>Ms. Narges Mohammadi, his wife, asks Dr. Shaheed to ensure that all of the civil 
associations are free to operate in Iran. People like herself and Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh are 
released, but once they are out, there is no structure in which for them to work and live, and 
they find themselves in a &#8220;bigger prison.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The situation of prisons in Iran &#8220;is horrendous.&#8221; Especially in Vakilabad, where there is an 
infamous &#8220;Section of Death,&#8221; where up to 500 people can be on death row at one time. </p>

<p>With the rise of President Rouhani, the &#8220;struggle between the Judiciary and the

</p>
<p>On 1 September 2013, there was a &#8220;massacre&#8221; at Camp Liberty involving cooperation 
between Iraq and Iran, specifically the Quds Forces. He believes that the reason for this

branches.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>With regard to the attack at Ashraf / Liberty, there are still seven &#8220;hostages&#8221; being held by 
the Government. The families of people at Ashraf / Liberty are harassed; for example, his 
own father, who was an Ayatollah, died 10 years ago, and after that the Government 
harassed their mother, because he and her sister living abroad have been affiliated with the 
MEK.

<p><b>  Mr. &#8220;Aslan&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Baha&#8217;i 
</b></p>
<p>A Baha&#8217;i father, Mr. &#8220;Aslan,&#8221; described to the Special Rapporteur how his family 
repeatedly experienced discrimination related to their economic and social rights. He had 
been working as a carpenter for several years in a shop. In 2001 he started his own shop and 
applied for the appropriate license at the semi-governmental carpenter&#8217;s guild. Licenses, he 
said, were typically granted within six months. The guild initially presented seemingly 
neutral reasons for not granting him a license, such as that fact that his shop was &#8220;too 
small.&#8221; But when he would get a bigger workspace they would offer a different reason.  
</p>
<p>After three years of back-and-forth guild staff allegedly told him that they actually were not 
approving his license because he was a Baha&#8217;i, a fact he had indicated on his initial 
application. He was forced to work without a license until 2009, when the mayor&#8217;s office 
finally closed his shop, causing him to lose his capital and tools. Also in 2009 his daughter 
wanted to enroll in a specialized public high school that offered classes in tourism, a subject 
she was interested in. Upon application the father asked the school&#8217;s principal if his 
daughter&#8217;s faith was an issue. A few days later the principal called the father and said that 
she had contacted the Ministry of Education and it instructed her not to grant admission to 
his Baha&#8217;i daughter.

<p><b>  Mehdi Noorzar 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political activist / lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>Green Movement activist Mehdi Noorzar, a lawyer formally employed in a state agency, 
told the Special Rapporteur that authorities arrested him on 9 August 2011 when he 
responded to a summons to Evin Prison. He reported being held in solitary confinement for 
three months and subjected to various forms of torture including: punching, kicking, baton 
beatings, whipping, blindfolding, and a mock execution. He said that his interrogators were 
trying to make him confess to connections with monarchist groups or the MEK, both of 
which he purportedly told interrogators he opposed. He was formally charged 20 days after 
the start of his detention on charges of acting against national security, insulting the 
supreme leader, insulting the president, blasphemy, and insulting clerics. At the trial the 
judge advised him not to bring his lawyer into the courtroom in order to receive a lighter 
sentence. Yet, the trial purportedly only lasted ten minutes, with the judge taking a very 
hostile tone, and Noorzar was sentenced to three years in prison. An appeals court reduced 
the sentence to one year in prison, a one-year suspended sentence, and 74 lashes. On 7 
August 2012 his one-year sentence came to an end, but as his release fell on a weekend, he 
was kept in prison for three more days until the flogger was at work to administer the 
lashes.
