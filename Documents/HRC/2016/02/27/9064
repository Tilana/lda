<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, Walter K&#228;lin, conducted an official mission to Georgia from 1 to 4 October 2008, at the 
invitation of the Government of Georgia and pursuant to his mandate contained in Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/32. His main objective was to engage in dialogue with the Government with 
a view to improving the protection and ensuring the full enjoyment of the human rights of 
internally displaced persons in Georgia. Accordingly, his assessment identifies key obstacles and 
conditions necessary to enable internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Georgia to find durable 
solutions. The Representative deeply regrets the current policies of the parties to the conflict on 
access to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, which prevented him from conducting the planned 
visit to this area. 
</p>
<p> As a result of the hostilities in northern Georgia that escalated on 7/8 August 2008, 
some 133,000 persons became displaced within Georgia. The Representative welcomes the 
prompt response of the Government to the crisis of displacement in the aftermath of hostilities 
and its plans to find durable solutions for all IDPs, including those in protracted displacement 
since the early 1990s. A large number of those displaced in August have been able to return to 
their homes. The main needs of those who returned to the so-called buffer zone adjacent to the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia relate to the challenge of recovery after return, including safety 
and the re-establishment of law and order. The reconstruction and repair of destroyed or looted 
houses, humanitarian assistance, and the re-establishment of basic services such as education and 
health is an important concern, as is the re-establishment of economic activity. The 
Representative urges the Government to continue to take all necessary steps to ensure that the 
conditions for sustainable return are created, allowing IDPs to return voluntarily, in safety and 
with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence. 
</p>
<p> According to government estimates of November 2008, about 37,605 IDPs will not 
return in the foreseeable future. This figure includes 19,111 IDPs from the Tskhinvali region/ 
South Ossetia, 1,821 IDPs from the upper Kodori Valley, as well as those IDPs who will spend 
the winter in displacement, namely 11,500 who cannot return to the area adjacent to the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia for reasons such as security or destruction of property, and some 
5,173 IDPs from Akhalgori.<b>1</b> The Government estimates it will be able to accommodate 
some 21,000 IDPs in durable housing by the end of 2008. The Representative commends the 
Government for its decision to provide durable solutions for those IDPs who are unlikely to

</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Office of the United Nations Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator, Situation report No. 35 on 
</p>
<p>the situation in Georgia, 6-13 November 2008. According to United Nations figures of 
9 December 2008 which are based on government figures, the estimate of return to the area 
adjacent to Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia has increased to a total of 27,805 as of 5 December. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimate of IDPs 
who cannot return to this area and will spend the winter in displacement is between 3,000 and 
5,000. The estimate of IDPs benefiting from government resettlement as of 15 November was 
cited as 2,300. </p>

</p>
<p>return in the foreseeable future. However, he is concerned about the almost exclusive emphasis 
on infrastructure and recommends that the Government develop a comprehensive integration 
policy, which would encompass the whole range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social 
rights of IDPs. Moreover, full participation of all segments of the internally displaced population 
in the planning and management of the resettlement plan should be guaranteed. 
</p>
<p> In this connection, the Representative recalls the voluntary nature of resettlement or return 
and emphasizes that resettlement opportunities shall be offered in a non-discriminatory manner, 
giving priority to vulnerable cases. IDPs shall be able to make a well-informed choice about 
durable solutions offered to them. 
</p>
<p> The biggest challenge is to integrate the approximately 220,000 internally displaced 
persons who have been living in protracted displacement for more than a decade, as described in 
the Representative&#8217;s previous report. The Representative welcomes the adoption, in late 
July 2008, of the Action Plan to implement decree No. 47 of the Government of Georgia &#8220;On 
Approving of the State Strategy for Internally Displaced Persons - Persecuted&#8221; which foresees 
measures aimed at integrating IDPs into mainstream society, as well as the decision of the 
Government to revise the Action Plan in light of the prevailing circumstances, and decree 
No. 854 of 4 December 2008 entrusting the Ministry of Refugees and Accommodation with its 
revision. The Representative was informed that a first draft of the new action plan has been 
prepared, and that in accordance with decree No. 4 of 12 January 2009, relevant governmental 
institutions are entrusted to take all necessary measures to finalize the drafting process in the 
nearest future. While welcoming the policy shift away from considering local reintegration and 
return to be mutually exclusive, the Representative remains concerned about the continued lack 
of integration of the &#8220;old&#8221; IDPs. The rights of this group of IDPs need to be ensured in tandem 
with responding to the new group of IDPs on a non-discriminatory basis. He recommends that 
the implementation of the Action Plan for IDPs adopted in July 2008 - with amendments to 
account for the newly displaced population - is given absolute priority by the Government. 
</p>
<p> Unimpeded humanitarian access to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia and Abkhazia 
continues to be a key concern. In this connection, the Representative re-emphasizes his concerns 
about the Law on the Occupied Territories which includes several provisions which may raise 
concerns as to their compliance with the international human rights obligations of Georgia. He 
urges the Government of Georgia to take all possible measures, without discrimination, to ensure 
protection of all human rights for the internally displaced population from or living inside all 
conflict-affected areas. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 6/32, and 
by invitation of the Government of Georgia, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons (the Representative), Walter K&#228;lin, conducted an 
official mission to Georgia from 1 to 4 October 2008 at the invitation of the Government of 
Georgia and in accordance with his mandate.<b>1</b> The mission built upon the Representative&#8217;s 
previous mission in December 2005<b> </b>and a follow-up visit in December 2006.<b>2 </b>His main 
objective was to engage in dialogue with the Government with a view to identifying the 
challenges in addressing the situation of the internally displaced following the conflict that 
occurred in August 2008; to explore possibilities for addressing such challenges in the immediate 
and long term; as well as to elaborate concrete recommendations in this regard. During his visit 
the Representative also aimed to assess the situation of those persons living in protracted 
displacement since the 1990s and the implementation of recommendations following his 
previous visits. 
</p>
<p>2. During the present mission, the Representative had meetings in Tbilisi with the 
Prime Minister of Georgia as well as the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Refugees and 
Accommodation, Health and Reintegration, the Deputy Minister of Interior and the Head of the 
Chancellery. He also held meetings with the United Nations Country Team, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and members of the diplomatic community. He visited collective shelters 
in Tbilisi, the construction site for a new IDP settlement in Tserovani as well as the tented camp 
in Gori. He also travelled to the so-called buffer zone, where he had discussions with 
spontaneous returnees. The Representative regrets that the policies of the parties to the conflict 
have prevented him from conducting the planned visit to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia 
until now. He intends to conduct this part of the mission as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>3. The Representative expresses his thanks for the open and frank conversations he was able 
to have with all of his interlocutors, which enabled him to gain a clearer picture of the present 
situation of internal displacement in Georgia. In particular, he would like to thank the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the logistical support 
provided throughout his mission. He is grateful for the information provided to him by 
representatives of civil society and would like to thank IDPs who were ready to share their 
experiences with him. 
</p>
<p>4. The Representative shared his primary findings with the Government at the conclusion of 
the visit and transmitted his preliminary conclusions and findings in early November. He was 
encouraged by the willingness of Government officials to engage in continuous dialogue to 
ensure that all internally displaced persons enjoy their human rights. He emphasizes his desire 
and intention to continue this dialogue.

</p>
<p>5. The Representative&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations in the present report are informed 
by the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (the Guiding Principles),<b>3</b> which, although 
not directly binding, reflect and are consistent with international human rights and international 
humanitarian law. They have been recognized by States as &#8220;an important international 
framework for the protection of internally displaced persons&#8221;,<b>4 </b>and are increasingly reflected in 
national laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>6. The Representative interprets his mandate as covering all internally displaced persons 
(IDPs) in Georgia, i.e. in accordance with the Guiding Principles &#8220;internally displaced persons 
are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes 
or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of 
armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or 
human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border&#8221;. As 
citizens of their country, IDPs in Georgia remain entitled to all guarantees of international human 
rights and international humanitarian law subscribed to by the State or applicable as customary 
international law. They do not lose, as a consequence of their displacement, the rights of the 
population at large. At the same time, IDPs have needs and vulnerabilities distinct from the 
non-displaced population, which must be addressed by specific protection and assistance 
measures. These rights are reflected and detailed in the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>7. The primary duty and responsibility to provide protection to IDPs lies with the national 
authorities, and IDPs have the right to request and receive such protection and assistance from 
the Government (Guiding Principle 3). At the same time, the Principles also apply to non-State 
actors who are effectively exercising control over a territory to the extent that the rights of IDPs 
and returnees are affected. There may be times when a State does not have the capacity to fulfil 
these obligations, because it either lacks means to do so, or does not have de facto control over 
parts of its territory. In such cases, the State has an obligation to allow others to fulfil this duty, 
in particular international agencies and organizations. Such support shall be considered in good 
faith and not as interference in the internal affairs of a State, and all authorities concerned shall 
grant and facilitate the free passage of humanitarian assistance and grant persons engaged in the 
provision of such assistance rapid and unimpeded access to the internally displaced (Guiding 
Principle 25). 
</p>
<p>8. Furthermore, and without prejudice to their legal status, those who hold de facto control 
are obliged to respect the rights of IDPs and secure their protection. The Guiding Principles 
&#8220;provide guidance to &#8230; all other authorities, groups and persons in their relations with internally 
displaced persons&#8221;. As highlighted in his report to the Commission on Human Rights on his 
previous visit to Georgia, in the circumstances at hand this means that the de facto authorities in 
the respective areas of Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia are responsible for

<p>preventing and avoiding actions which could lead to arbitrary displacement, as well as for 
protecting those who are displaced in areas under its control and respecting the rights of IDPs 
should they wish to return to or to resettle in areas controlled by them. Although such de facto 
authorities as well as the territories they control are not subjects of international law, they may 
nevertheless have obligations under international law. In times of internal armed conflict, 
article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions sets out basic obligations for all parties to a 
conflict irrespective of their status. As regards human rights, the obligations of Georgia under 
international treaty and human rights law continue to apply in the territories under the control of 
de facto authorities. Their acts are classified, under the rules of international law on State 
responsibility, as acts of the State to the extent that such authorities are in fact exercising 
elements of governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities, and in 
circumstances which call for the exercise of such authority.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL CONTEXT OF INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT IN GEORGIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Patterns of displacement 
</b></p>
<p>9. As a result of the hostilities in northern Georgia that escalated on 7/8 August 2008, 
some 133,000 persons became displaced within Georgia. According to an inter-agency 
assessment mission to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, an estimated 10,000 to 
15,000 persons remain displaced within the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia.<b>6</b> A ceasefire was 
signed between Russia and Georgia on 13 August, five days after the conflict had erupted. 
Russian troops subsequently withdrew from various locations across Georgia but remained in the 
areas adjacent to the administrative border of the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia (the so-called 
buffer zone). The European Union (EU) brokered an agreement providing for Russia to pull out 
its troops by 10 October, and for the deployment of at least 200 EU monitors, who started 
deployment during the visit of the Representative. The Russian withdrawal from the buffer zone 
was completed on 8 October. 
</p>
<p>10. The Representative, after having spoken to persons displaced in August from areas 
adjacent to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, considers that most of them fled primarily in 
order to avoid the dangers of war and general insecurity. With regard to those displaced from the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, and in view of the fact that the current political positions of all 
sides regarding access to this region resulted in the Representative not having access, he is not in 
a position to assess the situation as to the causes of displacement or the current situation of those 
displaced inside the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia. 
</p>
<p>11. Precise data on current displacement patterns remain difficult to establish. Currently, 
displacement in Georgia can be divided into three categories described below:

<p>A/HRC/10/13/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> (a) Approximately (according to the Civil Registry Agency) 107,026 persons fled the 
area adjacent to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia. IDPs from the Tskhinvali region/South 
Ossetia are estimated as of November 2008 as 19,111, from the upper Kodori Valley as 1,821, 
and those displaced from Akhalgori as 5,173.<b>7</b> According to the Office of the United Nations 
Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator, an estimated 75,000 persons displaced from Gori and 
surrounding areas returned soon after the end of hostilities in August and September, while an 
estimated 24,596 of the persons who fled the so-called buffer zone have been able to return home 
in the Shida Kartli region following the withdrawal of Russian troops between 7 October and 
10 November 2008.<b>8</b> The main needs of the latter category relate to the challenge of recovery 
after return including safety (including humanitarian demining) and the re-establishment of law 
and order. The reconstruction and repairs of destroyed or looted houses; humanitarian assistance 
with food and firewood; the re-establishment of basic services such as education and health; as 
well as the re-establishment of economic activities are important concerns; 
</p>
<p> (b) According to government estimates, some 37,605 IDPs will not return in the 
foreseeable future. This figure includes the 19,111 IDPs from the Tskhinvali region/South 
Ossetia and the 1,821 IDPs from the upper Kodori Valley, as well as those IDPs who will spend 
the winter in displacement, namely 11,500 who cannot return to the area adjacent to the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia for reasons such as security or destruction of property, and 
some 5,173 IDPs from Akhalgori.<b>9 </b>The Government estimates that some 21,000 displaced will 
be accommodated in durable housing by the end of the year; 
</p>
<p> (c) Approximately 220,000 internally displaced persons from the territories of Abkhazia 
and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia have been living in protracted displacement for more 
than a decade following the conflicts in the aftermath of the independence of the former Soviet 
Republic of Georgia in 1991 as described in the Representative&#8217;s previous report.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  General human rights situation in Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>12. Georgia is party to several universal and regional human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol and Second 
Optional Protocol; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its 
Optional Protocol; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>

<p>Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol; the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
Furthermore, it is party to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide; the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; and the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. Georgia is also party to the Geneva Conventions and the 
Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977. At the regional level, Georgia is party to the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, including 
its Protocols Nos. 1 to 14, the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as the Framework Convention for the Protection 
of National Minorities. 
</p>
<p>13. Several treaty bodies have issued observations and recommendations to Georgia on the 
implementation of their obligations under the above treaties. With regard to the situation of the 
internally displaced, the treaty bodies have formulated a series of recommendations regarding 
IDPs living in protracted displacement. In November 2007, the Human Rights Committee 
expressed concern at the forced eviction of IDPs from collective centres in Tbilisi, Kutaisi and 
Adjara, without a court decision or agreement of persons concerned, and without proper 
compensation and support by governmental agencies, in violation of articles 12 and 26 of the 
ICCPR. The Human Rights Committee recommended that Georgia ensure proper regulation of 
the privatization of collective centres, and take all necessary measures to prevent cases of forced 
evictions of IDPs in the future. It also asked that Georgia ensure that the plan of action for IDPs 
is fully in line with all provisions under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in particular 
the principles of voluntariness of return and non-discrimination.<b>11</b> In June 2008, the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child welcomed the adoption of the draft plan of action on IDPs but 
expressed its concern at the continued serious socio-economic deprivation of IDPs and their 
limited access to housing, health services and education as well as the physical and 
psychological impact of displacement on children. It was also concerned at the potential negative 
impact of segregated schools on internally displaced children. The Committee recommended that 
Georgia give the highest priority to the protection of the rights of internally displaced children 
and incorporate the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement in the legislation and policies of 
the State party.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Complaints have been voiced by all sides regarding violations of international human 
rights and humanitarian law in the context of the August 2008 conflict. The Council of Europe 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, after having visited Vladikavkaz, 
Tskhinvali, Gori, Tbilisi and Moscow from 22 to 29 August, in order to assess the human rights 
situation in the areas affected by the conflict, concluded that &#8220;the conflict has had a devastating 
effect on the human rights of the population&#8221;. Following his visit, the Commissioner presented 
six principles for the urgent protection of human rights and humanitarian security, including the

<p>need to guarantee the right to return, to ensure adequate living conditions until IDPs can return, 
the need for demining, to immediately stop physical assault, torching of houses and looting 
and to hold perpetrators to account, the protection of prisoners of war, and the need for an 
international presence and assistance in the area affected by the conflict.<b>13</b> Those principles were 
endorsed at the international level and accepted by all relevant actors involved in the conflict. At 
the end of September, Commissioner Hammarberg undertook a further visit to assess the 
follow-up given to his recommendations.<b>14</b> He noted progress in some areas, such as support to 
ensure adequate living conditions for the internally displaced, but reiterated his concerns 
regarding the need to ensure safety for people in all areas affected by the conflict. Furthermore, 
he recommended that all political decision makers must make a clear statement of commitment 
to the principles of the right to return.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>15. On 12 August 2008, Georgia lodged a complaint against Russia with the International 
Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination by supporting ethnic cleansing of Georgians during the 
present conflict and during the 1990s. On 14 August, Georgia submitted a request for the 
indication of provisional measures. On 15 October the ICJ ordered provisional measures to be 
taken by both Georgia and the Russian Federation to refrain from engaging in any act of racial 
discrimination and to ensure, without distinction as to national or ethnic origin, the security of 
persons and their right to freedom of movement and residence within the border of the State, as 
well as to protect the property of displaced persons and refugees.<b>16</b> Also, the Court indicated as 
one of the provisional measures that &#8220;both parties shall facilitate, and refrain from placing any 
impediments to, humanitarian assistance in support of the rights to which the local population are 
entitled under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination&#8221;.<b>17</b>

<p><b>II.  RESPONSES TO INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic responses 
</b></p>
<p>16. The immediate humanitarian response from the Government to the rapid displacement 
resulting from the escalation of the conflict on 7/8 August is generally considered to have been 
speedy and adequate. Nevertheless, the Representative was informed that in the initial stages of 
the emergency, the coordination of the Government response was unclear and changed several 
times, revealing a lack of preparedness at the level of the competent authorities. This observation 
is shared by the Council of Europe Commissioner on Human Rights who considered, following 
his August visit, that neither the authorities nor the international community had done enough to 
provide the displaced with adequate living conditions, which had, however, improved in the 
course of September. As noted earlier, during his follow-up visit, the Commissioner remained 
concerned at the inadequate material conditions in the collective centres,<b>18</b> a concern which is 
shared by the Representative. 
</p>
<p>17. The Representative encourages the authorities to evaluate the lessons learned and to 
strengthen, with the support of the international community, their capacity to efficiently address 
future occurrences of internal displacement that may be caused by armed conflict but also by 
other events, including natural and man-made disasters. 
</p>
<p>18. The Representative welcomes the fact that in contrast to earlier responses to displacement, 
in the aftermath of the August conflict the Government endorsed a policy of full support to 
local integration of IDPs from the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia and Abkhazia and quickly 
adopted implementation measures, in particular in the area of housing. Accordingly, it is 
building houses in three different locations, one of which the Representative was able to visit 
(Tserovani). As noted above, the Government of Georgia estimates it will be able to 
accommodate some 21,000 IDPs in durable housing by the end of 2008. While noting the 
Government&#8217;s clear commitment to provide housing and plots of land, and commending its 
awareness that such plans must take into account the relationship with the local community, the 
Representative is concerned about the almost exclusive emphasis on infrastructure. Such 
infrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for ensuring durable solutions, which 
require similar if not greater attention to social and economic integration. 
</p>
<p>19. Shortly before the eruption of the conflict, in July 2008, the Government had adopted the 
Action Plan to implement decree No. 47 of the Government of Georgia &#8220;On approving of the 
State Strategy for Internally Displaced Persons - Persecuted&#8221; (the Action Plan), a welcome step 
by the Government which is in accordance with previous recommendations of the Representative 
and facilitated and supported by numerous international agencies and partners. The Action Plan 
includes measures for (a) the creation of conditions for the dignified and safe return of IDPs, 
including the creation of conditions for return and provision of assistance to presumed returnees; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  See footnote 14, p. 8. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/13/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>and (b) support for decent living conditions for the displaced population and for their 
participation in society, including improvement of the living and socio-economic conditions of 
IDPs.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The Representative was informed that in the aftermath of the crisis, the Government is 
planning to revise the IDP Strategy to respond to new requirements resulting from this new 
displacement. He notes that by decree No. 854 of 4 December 2008, the Government of Georgia 
has entrusted the Ministry of Refugees and Accommodation with the revision of the existing 
Action Plan. He was further informed that a first draft of the new action plan has been prepared, 
and that in accordance with decree No. 4 of 12 January 2009, relevant government institutions 
were entrusted with finalizing the drafting in the near future. He welcomes this development and 
encourages the authorities to continue to give utmost priority to the revision of the Action Plan 
and to ensure that there will be no delay in its implementation as a result. Implementation of the 
Action Plan as revised must be given absolute priority by the Government. 
</p>
<p>21. Moreover, the Representative was informed of a general policy shift aimed at harmonizing 
the social assistance scheme. New IDPs would be considered under the &#8220;targeted social 
assistance system of the Government&#8221; which includes, for instance, free medical care. This 
would also imply moving IDPs out of collective centres and the cessation of special programmes 
for all IDPs. The overarching idea is to move from status-based assistance to IDPs to assistance 
based on rational, clear and transparent criteria of real need and vulnerability. While in principle 
the Representative welcomes such an approach, and in particular, as noted above, the 
acknowledgement of the Government that providing IDPs with possibilities for a life in dignity 
in the host community and the right to return - which continues to be an entitlement - are not 
mutually exclusive, he is concerned about the danger of forced evictions as well as the 
continuing lack of clarity as to the criteria used to determine who will be included in 
State-sponsored programmes. The Representative reiterates his serious concern about vulnerable 
persons in protracted displacement and in particular the caseload of elderly persons for whom the 
issuing of vouchers will be insufficient. With regard to the assessment of eligibility, and in view 
of the need to accelerate it, the Government may wish to consider redefining the burden of proof 
to start from the premise that everyone qualifies for assistance. 
</p>
<p>22. Finally, the Representative was impressed by the vibrant civil society which has responded 
quickly and effectively to the crisis. These organizations continue to provide assistance to the 
internally displaced in order to ensure that their human rights are respected and ensured. Their 
monitoring and assistance programmes are key in ensuring the protection of the human rights of 
IDPs, including their participation in decisions that affect them.

</p>
<p><b>B.  International responses 
</b></p>
<p>23. The humanitarian response to the crisis in August focused on the provision of essential 
support to the new group of internally displaced persons across Georgia, including to some 
36,600 IDPs in 382 collective centres in Tbilisi. Much of the initial concentration of the IDPs in 
Tbilisi was dispersed through a secondary movement from Tbilisi to the Shida Kartli region (the 
main town of which is Gori) where some 7,200 persons were accommodated in a tented camp, in 
collective shelters, and in host families. UNHCR played a prominent role in ensuring that the key 
protection and assistance needs of the IDPs were being addressed promptly and effectively, 
including prioritizing physical safety at the beginning of the emergency and supporting the 
Government with prompt and accurate registration in order to develop an appropriate response. 
Throughout the initial period following the outbreak of hostilities and the movement of displaced 
persons, UNHCR acted as lead agency and, together with its partners, worked to ensure 
monitoring of protection concerns regarding population movements, living conditions in shelters 
and general needs, response to special needs, especially those of pregnant women, flight histories 
and traumatizing experiences, security concerns, the voluntary character of returns, enrolment of 
IDP children in schools, and the conditions in return areas.<b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>24. The response in Georgia was rapidly organized through a Humanitarian Coordination 
Group, comprising United Nations agencies, international organizations, NGOs, Government 
and donor representatives. Using in-country stocks, relief supplies were delivered mainly to the 
affected populations in and around Tbilisi. UNHCR also set up and managed the tented camp in 
Gori where at its peak some 2,500 IDPs were accommodated. The Italian Red Cross provided a 
field kitchen. The Representative visited a kindergarten that accommodated IDPs in Gori, as well 
as the well-organized camp which provided the basic humanitarian requirements. In their 
discussions with the Representative the key concerns raised by IDPs living in the camp related to 
their uncertainties as to the possibilities of return, the state of their homes and security conditions 
for return once the Russian forces retreat from the buffer zone. Only a few weeks after the 
Representative&#8217;s visit, UNHCR reported on 17 October that the camp had been closed as a result 
of the return of a significant number of IDPs following the withdrawal of Russian troops. 
</p>
<p>25. Working in close collaboration with the Government of Georgia, and following best 
practices in humanitarian coordination, the Humanitarian Coordination Group (HCG), under the 
leadership of the United Nations Resident/Humanitarian Coordinator, prepared a flash appeal 
which was launched on 18 August, to cover the identified and estimated needs of IDPs. It 
prioritized immediate life-saving activities in six sectors, including food; health and nutrition; 
protection; shelter and non-food items; water, sanitation and hygiene; and logistics and 
telecommunications, plus a seventh sector of coordination and support services. Based upon 
improved assessment and access, a revised appeal was launched in early October which 
introduced refinements in the above areas and a range of early recovery initiatives.

</p>
<p>26. The refinements in the revised flash appeal have paralleled and informed the joint needs 
assessment (JNA) carried out at the request of the Government by the United Nations, the 
World Bank and other international organizations/agencies to address humanitarian, recovery 
and reconstruction, as well as development needs. The JNA is designed to address the needs of 
those directly and indirectly affected by the conflict as well as macroeconomic impact and 
infrastructure damage and losses and is viewed as the basis for early recovery efforts.<b>21</b> The 
findings were presented at the donors&#8217; conference held in Brussels on 22 October. It has 
identified donor support for post-conflict recovery activities in three areas, including support for 
the rapid restoration of confidence, for social needs, and for critical investments. 
</p>
<p>27. The Representative acknowledges the prompt humanitarian response by the international 
community and the work done by international humanitarian agencies and NGOs which has 
contributed to the prevention of casualties caused by displacement. 
</p>
<p><b>III. PROTECTION NEEDS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
PERSONS DURING DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General remarks 
</b></p>
<p>28. The conflict that occurred in August 2008 has had a significant impact on the civilian 
population, both IDPs and host communities. Throughout his mission, interlocutors emphasized 
that while the immediate needs of the newly displaced are being addressed, a harmonized, 
non-discriminatory approach towards both new IDPs and those persons living in protracted 
displacement is essential. In this connection and with reference to his previous 
recommendations, the Representative takes note with satisfaction of the adoption, in late 
July 2008, of the Action Plan, which foresees measures aimed at integrating IDPs into 
mainstream society, in particular by providing them with permanent housing or vouchers to 
acquire such housing. The Action Plan has translated the principles of the Strategy referred to 
above into concrete programme areas including housing, livelihood and education. The 
Representative also welcomes the decision to revise the Action Plan in light of the present 
situation. 
</p>
<p>29. While welcoming the overall approach adopted by the Government in addressing the rights 
of IDPs and the shift in Government policy away from considering local reintegration and return 
to be mutually exclusive, and envisaging for the first time the possibility of local integration, the 
Representative continues to be concerned about the continued lack of integration of the &#8220;old&#8221; 
IDPs. The rights of this group of IDPs need to be ensured in tandem with responding to the new 
group of internally displaced on a non-discriminatory basis. The Representative encourages the 
Government to ensure that a holistic approach towards all groups of IDPs is employed. 
</p>
<p>30. The Representative continues to be concerned about the special attention required for 
vulnerable groups amongst the displaced, such as the elderly or persons with disabilities, for 
whom vouchers are insufficient. Rather, particular attention should be paid to vulnerable groups 
among the displaced so as to ensure that they are able to fully enjoy their rights.

</b>  See footnote 19, p. 10. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/13/Add.2

</p>
<p>31. Furthermore, according to the findings and recommendations of a rapid needs assessment 
of internally displaced women, carried out by the Institute for Policy Studies with the support of 
the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and presented to the 
Representative during his mission, violence against women has escalated in the context of the 
conflict. He urges the Government to ensure implementation of the Law on the Elimination of 
Domestic Violence, Protection of and Assistance to the Victims of Domestic Violence, and to 
provide victims with shelters, hotlines and rehabilitation centres. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>32. Ensuring shelter for temporary and long-term accommodation is a key issue which requires 
urgent attention. A significant number of newly displaced in Tbilisi have been accommodated in 
collective centres, both in new shelters and in shelters where IDPs who had previously been 
displaced were residing. The Representative visited two collective centres where he was 
informed of urgent needs for water and sanitation repairs. During his meetings with IDPs, the 
Representative heard various complaints, including the lack of electricity and problems with 
sanitation. The need for urgent winterization of collective centres was highlighted as a priority 
concern. 
</p>
<p>33. For the IDPs accommodated in the collective centres in Tbilisi, securing basic living 
standards remains a challenge.<b>22</b> IDPs who spoke with the Representative flagged the need for 
warmer blankets and clothing. The Representative heard a variety of voices highlighting the need 
for supplementary feeding for certain groups, for instance the need for baby food. Several IDPs 
indicated problems relating to the need for medicines and access to health care. As regards the 
right to adequate food, the Representative was informed that the main findings of the World 
Food Programme emergency food security assessment, conducted during the first half of 
September, found that IDPs were totally dependent on Government and international aid to meet 
their basic needs. About 60 per cent of IDPs have no income at all.<b>23</b> The Representative notes 
that the majority of IDPs had relied on agriculture for their livelihoods. The question of access to 
agricultural land and the property rights of IDPs is of prime importance. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  IDP status and related benefits 
</b></p>
<p>34. Registration of the newly displaced persons has been carried out by the Civil Registry 
Agency (CRA), facilitating registration, which assists in obtaining humanitarian assistance but 
does not provide formal IDP status. In several discussions throughout the visit, including with 
IDPs, the Representative heard complaints about the failure of the Government to grant IDP 
status and related benefits to the new group of IDPs. The Representative shares their concern that 
the Government must ensure that IDPs displaced in August are not discriminated against in 
terms of benefits and legal protection mechanisms, such as legal guarantees for housing and

<p>security of tenure and protection from forceful eviction, and receive equal treatment by the 
authorities. He welcomes the information provided by the Government, indicating that persons 
displaced as a result of the August 2008 hostilities will be granted IDP status during the first 
quarter of 2009. At the same time, the Representative recalls the utmost importance of 
accelerating the implementation of the (revised) Plan of Action to ensure that the human rights of 
all IDPs, both old and new, are respected, protected and fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>35. The Representative recommends that the issue of equal treatment of new IDPs and those 
from previous conflicts is addressed as a matter of priority, particularly in terms of humanitarian 
assistance, housing and security of tenure and protection from forceful eviction from collective 
centres. 
</p>
<p>36. The Representative notes that early, clear and coordinated registration and documentation 
of all new IDPs to enable them to access IDP benefits immediately, as well as raising the 
awareness of IDPs of their rights through information campaigns, has been identified as a 
priority activity in the JNA with regard to protection and rights.<b>24</b> He encourages the authorities 
to implement this task as a matter of priority and welcomes the information regarding the 
granting of IDP status. 
</p>
<p>37. At the same time, the implementation of the Action Plan for all IDPs, both new and &#8220;old&#8221;, 
remains a serious concern. The Representative was informed of increasing dissatisfaction on the 
part of &#8220;old&#8221; IDPs as a result of the shift of emphasis to the newly displaced and a feeling of lack 
of attention to their human rights on the part of the Government. The Representative emphasizes 
his serious concerns as to the equal treatment of both &#8220;old&#8221; and newly displaced persons and his 
recommendations that solutions be based on objective criteria of vulnerability irrespective of 
when the displacement occurred. Such distinction is not only a violation of the principles of 
non-discrimination, but - as was pointed out to the Representative by several IDPs and civil 
society organizations - the current state of affairs, particularly the differential treatment/status 
between old and new IDPs may lead to increased tensions among groups of IDPs. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Access to education 
</b></p>
<p>38. During his discussion with IDPs, the Representative learned of several concerns regarding 
access of IDP children to schools, including fears that they would be segregated from other 
children. He received information that there was limited coordination in assigning new IDP 
children to local schools and that those in collective centres had not been accepted in local 
schools. Several IDPs he met in collective centres indicated an overall lack of textbooks and 
basic school equipment. The Representative welcomes the fact that the JNA includes provisions 
for the education sector to ensure that all internally displaced children and children directly or 
indirectly affected by the conflict enjoy full access to education.<b>25</b> It similarly highlights the need 
for programmes to address the psychosocial needs of IDP children who suffer from the trauma of 
violence and separation from their homes.<b>

</p>
<p><b>IV. PROTECTION NEEDS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS 
REGARDING RETURN AND OTHER DURABLE SOLUTIONS TO 
DISPLACEMENT 
</b></p>
<p>39. In accordance with Guiding Principle 28, IDPs have the right to choose freely between 
return to their place of origin, local integration or resettlement in another part of the country. The 
Representative recalls that the decision of resettlement or return shall be voluntary and informed, 
and emphasizes that resettlement opportunities shall be offered in a non-discriminatory manner, 
giving priority to vulnerable cases. IDPs shall be able to make a well-informed choice about 
durable solutions offered to them and the authorities have an obligation to create an environment 
where IDPs can participate fully in the planning and management of their return, resettlement 
and reintegration. Moreover, the authorities have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the 
integration of IDPs into the social, cultural and economic life of the community, regardless of the 
solution chosen. Also, in accordance with Guiding Principle 29, IDPs and returnees have the 
right to be protected from discrimination as a result of their displacement and to recover their 
property and, in cases where this is not possible, to obtain appropriate compensation or another 
form of just reparation. 
</p><p>40. The Representative is concerned that the extent to which IDPs have been included in 
planning processes for resettlement and temporary and permanent housing solutions has been 
insufficient. During his discussions with the authorities and other stakeholders, the 
Representative emphasized the importance of providing IDPs with the opportunity to make an 
informed choice as to whether to locally integrate, return or resettle on a temporary or permanent 
basis. In order to guarantee this right, it is essential that transparent procedures for relocation and 
resettlement be ensured and the targeted population receive sufficient information on the 
conditions in the areas of resettlement and relocation. 
</p>
<p>41. A systematic approach must be developed to ensure consistent consultation and 
information-sharing with IDPs. IDPs have a fundamental right to participate in decisions 
affecting their lives.<b>26</b> For responsible authorities, the information gained can improve the 
effectiveness of the response. For IDPs, consultation enhances feelings of participation and trust. 
Information-sharing, complete, timely and accessible, is furthermore essential to allow IDPs to 
make voluntary, informed and therefore sustainable decisions regarding their futures. These 
principles have also been included in the JNA,<b>27</b> and the Representative urges all stakeholders 
involved to continue to attach priority to IDP consultation and informed participation. 
</p>
<p>42. The right to return to their place of origin is one of the key rights of internally displaced 
persons; arbitrary forced displacement is in itself a violation of this right. Most of the persons 
who fled the so-called buffer zone have been able to return home following the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from this zone on 8 October, although the Representative is concerned that the

</b>  See for example, Guiding Principles 18 (3) and 28 (2).

</p>
<p>circumstances of some returns may not have been in all cases fully in accordance with the 
principles of voluntary return in safety and dignity. According to the Ministry of Refugees and 
Accommodation, some 24,500 persons returned in October 2008.<b>28</b> Regrettably, the prospect of 
being able to return in the foreseeable future is more limited for an estimated 37,506 IDPs, given 
the current political constellation and the failure to reach a peaceful solution between the main 
parties. 
</p>
<p>43. The overwhelming majority of those IDPs who met with the Representative all expressed 
their wish to return, irrespective of the fact that they were aware that such return would in all 
likelihood not be possible in the near future. All parties should reaffirm their commitment to 
giving full effect to this right. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Return in safety and dignity 
</b></p>
<p>44. A key factor for successful return is to ensure the physical safety of returnees. During his 
visit, the Representative met with several witnesses, United Nations agencies and their partners, 
as well as monitors of the European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) which started its work, 
inter alia, in the so-called buffer zone, at the time of his visit still under Russian control. The 
Representative was deeply concerned about the lack of effective protection of the population 
who have remained in the areas adjacent to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, which has been 
categorized into three distinct zones, primarily based on access and security considerations. He 
was concerned that particularly in the northern zone, the situation was extremely volatile. During 
his visit to the so-called buffer zone, he witnessed evidence of widespread looting of property 
and listened to villagers reporting incidents of harassment and violent threats committed by 
armed elements, in tandem with a failure by Russian forces to respond and carry out their duty 
to protect, particularly in the northernmost area adjacent to the de facto border with the 
Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia. Villagers explained their permanent fear of attack by what they 
described as armed bandits coming from the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, and their repeated 
but unsuccessful requests to the Russian forces for protection. Villagers insisted that there were 
no problems between neighbours within the same villages, irrespective of their ethnic origins, 
but that the perpetrators were coming from outside the villages, i.e. the Tskhinvali region/ 
South Ossetia. 
</p>
<p>45. An absence of the rule of law and a climate of impunity could be significant obstacles to 
the sustainability of returns. Many of the IDPs interviewed in the tented camp expressed their 
clear wish to return as soon as possible to their villages in the buffer zone, but hesitated out of 
fear. Some members of their families had gone back during the day and returned to the camp at 
night. The Representative welcomes the fact that the EUMM started its work during the time of 
his visit and spoke with newly arrived EUMM monitors in the buffer zone. Unfortunately, the 
monitors, at the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, were significantly handicapped in carrying out 
their functions effectively due to a lack of 24-hour presence and insufficient language skills.

<p>The Representative was assured by the Head of EUMM that these concerns would be addressed 
as a matter of priority. The Representative welcomes the total openness of EUMM to his 
observations and its readiness to cooperate with United Nations agencies to ensure the return of 
internally displaced persons in safety and dignity, and to contribute to creating an environment 
where human rights are respected and ensured. The Representative also welcomes the assurances 
of the Georgian authorities that they will ensure law enforcement in these areas in order to 
guarantee the physical safety of the returnee population and local residents. 
</p>
<p>46. However, the Representative remains concerned about reports that in some parts of this 
area a certain degree of insecurity persists. The Government must re-establish safety and security 
in all IDP and return areas, protecting the civilian population from all forms of harassment or 
physical harm. Clear monitoring and accountability mechanisms must be established. 
</p>
<p>47. According to information received by the Representative, unexploded ordnance remains a 
problem and demining in the areas affected by the conflict has been insufficient. Demining and 
mine-awareness programmes must continue to be implemented as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Adequate standard of living 
</b></p>
<p>48. In addition to physical fear, during his meetings with displaced persons, the Representative 
noted a great uncertainty about the future, due to factors such as the destruction of houses and 
crops, the cutting down of orchards and the lack of firewood (which had previously come from 
the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia). The initial assessment of the Public Defender of Georgia 
of the villages in the adjacent areas, which included 13 communities and 31 villages, concludes 
that some 1,200 houses were damaged to a medium to serious extent. The report highlights 
priority humanitarian needs for each village, including requirements for food, medicines and 
remission of taxes for electricity, as well as special attention required for vulnerable groups. The 
report documents the multiple factors contributing to insecurity as described above, ranging from 
the incursion of armed bands to the presence of unexploded ordnance.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>49. The population who have experienced temporary displacement and have since returned are 
in need of assistance to restore their livelihoods and repair damage to their property, including 
the rebuilding of destroyed houses. The Representative believes there is an urgent need for a 
strong humanitarian response to support and sustain the return, combined with 
confidence-building measures, through presence and protection monitoring. 
</p>
<p>50. As regards adequate housing and security of tenure, the Representative heard serious 
concerns resulting from the lack of a comprehensive housing policy. The need for securing the 
tenure rights of both temporary and long-term displaced persons is of key importance in 
providing the basis for durable solutions and preventing further displacement. The 
Representative was informed that until now, there has been a lack of clear approvals and

</p>
<p>corresponding legal regulations on the part of the authorities with regard to objects which have 
been selected for permanent housing solutions. This lack of clarity should be remedied without 
delay. 
</p>
<p>51. In this connection, the Representative re-emphasizes his continuing concerns regarding the 
housing and economic situation of those IDPs who were displaced in the early 1990s. As a result 
of the previous official view that return was the only option, integration in both rural and urban 
areas has had insufficient support from the Government. The Representative is concerned that 
almost half of the &#8220;old&#8221; IDPs are still residing in public buildings of a deplorable standard and 
that their economic situation is similarly grave. The Representative recalls his previous 
recommendations to address the widespread - and disproportionate - poverty and unemployment 
amongst IDPs. Following his visit in December 2005, the Representative encouraged the 
Government to, inter alia, implement its plans to improve the living conditions of IDPs, in 
particular by closing collective centres, raising the monthly financial allowance to which IDPs 
are entitled on the basis of up-to-date needs assessments, and by offering income-generating 
projects and providing land plots.<b>30</b> Utmost attention to the range of civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights remains a key concern and should be remedied without delay. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Resettlement 
</b></p>
<p>52. As noted above, according to government estimates, some 37,605 IDPs will not return in 
the foreseeable future. This figure includes 19,111 IDPs from the Tskhinvali region/South 
Ossetia, 1,821 IDPs from the upper Kodori Valley, as well as those IDPs who will spend the 
winter in displacement, namely 11,500 who cannot return to the area adjacent to the Tskhinvali 
region/South Ossetia for reasons such as security or destruction of property, and some 
5,173 IDPs from Akhalgori.<b>31</b> The Government estimates that some 21,000 displaced will be 
accommodated in durable housing by the end of the year. The Representative commends the 
Government of Georgia for its decision to provide durable solutions for those IDPs who are 
unlikely to be able to return in the foreseeable future. He was impressed by the construction of 
houses in three different locations, which according to the Government would be of different 
types, specifically, 2,000 houses to be built in Tserovani, of a more urban character; 400 houses 
with plots for agriculture; and 300 houses with larger areas of land and livestock. He visited the 
construction site in Tserovani. 
</p>
<p>53. Drawing on his experience from other countries, the Representative felt that while it was 
commendable that new houses were being built for IDPs, he was concerned about the almost 
exclusive emphasis on infrastructure. Such infrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient 
condition for ensuring durable solutions, which requires similar if not more attention to social 
and economic integration. The Representative welcomes the clear commitment of the

<p>Government to provide housing, plots of land and livestock, and commends its awareness that 
resettlement plans must take into account issues related to political participation and the 
relationship with the local community. However, the Representative recommends that the 
Government develop a comprehensive integration policy which would encompass the whole 
range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights of IDPs. Such policies would not 
only address the question of accommodation, but would also facilitate access to education and 
health care, and would ensure the creation of economic opportunities allowing IDPs to sustain 
themselves. Finally, and distinct from the right to adequate shelter, protection of IDPs&#8217; housing, 
land and property rights is an essential component of durable solutions. IDPs are entitled to 
restitution or compensation for their property, regardless of whether they choose to return, 
integrate locally or resettle. 
</p>
<p>54. During his interviews with IDPs in collective centres, a strong desire for extended families 
and communities to remain together was expressed and the Representative could sense a general 
lack of clarity as to the organization of resettlement and the criteria for selecting those who 
would be resettled. Many of the IDPs met by the Representative expressed their frustration at the 
lack of detailed information about government proposals and the different options available to 
them. The Representative has raised the issue of the need to provide detailed information on the 
eligibility criteria for determining the allocation of housing. It is of prime importance to ensure 
that IDPs are fully informed and consulted about developments that affect their future. Such 
consultation would not only ensure the efficient use of government resources, but also give IDPs 
a sense of ownership and control over their lives. Full and transparent information will be a key 
component in ensuring the sustainability of resettlement. The Representative encourages the 
Government to involve affected communities in the planning and implementation of the 
programmes the Government is establishing on their behalf and to ensure their informed 
participation. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  HUMANITARIAN ACCESS 
</b></p>
<p>55. In accordance with Guiding Principle 25, the primary duty and responsibility for providing 
humanitarian assistance to IDPs lies with national authorities. International organizations, 
however, play an important role in supporting Governments in meeting these responsibilities, 
especially where Governments are unable or unwilling to provide necessary assistance. In 
Georgia, the issue of access to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, and to some extent also to 
Abkhazia, has yet to be resolved. The Representative notes the adoption by Parliament on 
23 October, and the subsequent signing by the President, of the Law on the Occupied Territories. 
While appreciating that he was given the opportunity to provide comments and welcoming some 
amendments to the draft to bring it into line with the international human rights obligations of 
Georgia, the Representative remains concerned that several provisions which may raise concerns 
as to their compliance with international human rights obligations have been retained. He 
remains concerned that the law may seriously affect humanitarian access to the Tskhinvali 
region/South Ossetia and Abkhazia and even hinder the return of displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>56. The Representative urges the Government of Georgia to take all possible measures, 
without discrimination, to ensure protection of all human rights for the internally displaced 
population from or living inside the conflict-affected areas. He would like to recall that internally </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/13/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>displaced persons, as citizens of Georgia, are entitled to the full protection of human rights 
available to the population of Georgia by virtue of the obligations Georgia has accepted under 
relevant human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the European 
Convention on Human Rights, and that Georgia should refrain from any measures that may 
negatively affect the enjoyment of the human rights of displaced persons and returnees as spelled 
out in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement in areas not under the control of the 
Georgian authorities. Also, as regards the question of the recognition of civil acts carried out by 
the de facto authorities, such as the issuance of birth, marriage or death certificates, the 
invalidation of such acts as provided for by the law would have a serious impact on the effective 
enjoyment of human rights by the population living in the conflict-affected areas, in violation of 
Georgia&#8217;s obligations under international human rights treaties, notably the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons acknowledges the substantial achievements of the Government but 
believes that further efforts are required. He reiterates his desire to continue his dialogue 
with the Government, and specifically, to cooperate in the search for durable and equitable 
solutions for all internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Georgia. In this spirit, he makes the 
following conclusions and recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p>58. <b>The main problem encountered by IDPs in Georgia continues to be the absence of 
political solutions to regional conflicts, as observed in the Representative&#8217;s previous report 
and which remains a key concern, as evidenced by the new displacement of some 
133,000 persons within Georgia, of whom an estimated 37,600 will not be able to return in 
the foreseeable future. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Representative calls on all parties to take all necessary steps to ensure persons 
displaced by the recent and past conflicts are able to enjoy their right to return voluntarily 
to their former homes in safety and dignity, and to guarantee recovery of their property 
and possessions. Where such recovery is not possible, they should obtain appropriate 
compensation or another form of just reparation. 
</b>60. <b>IDPs have the right to freely choose whether they want to return, integrate locally or 
resettle in another part of the country. The Representative welcomes the recognition of this 
right by Government authorities and the policy shift in accordance with it. He urges 
relevant authorities to raise awareness of and promote this right so as to render the choice 
meaningful for IDPs and to create economic opportunities allowing IDPs to sustain 
themselves, irrespective of their choice as regards durable solutions. Moreover, protection 
of IDPs&#8217; housing, land and property rights is an essential component of durable solutions. 
IDPs are entitled to restitution or compensation for their property, regardless of whether 
they choose to return, integrate locally or resettle. </b></p>

</p>
<p>61. <b>The Representative remains concerned about reports that in some areas of return 
adjacent to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia a certain degree of insecurity persists. He 
recommends that the Government of Georgia: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Take all required steps to ensure that the conditions for sustainable return are 
created, which would allow internally displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety and 
with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence. This includes ensuring the 
physical safety and security of the returnee population and local residents, guaranteeing 
law and order in all affected areas and ensuring that the physical and material conditions 
required for return are established through humanitarian assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Implement demining as well as mine-awareness programmes; 
 (c) Ensure effective monitoring of the protection of human rights of internally 
displaced persons and returnees. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Representative commends the Government of Georgia for its decision to provide 
durable solutions for those IDPs who are unlikely to be able to return in the foreseeable 
future. However, he is concerned at the almost exclusive focus on infrastructure. He 
recommends that the Government develop a comprehensive integration policy which 
would encompass the whole range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights of 
IDPs. Such policies would not only address the question of accommodation, but would also 
facilitate access to education and health care, and would ensure the creation of economic 
opportunities, allowing IDPs to sustain themselves. Moreover, full participation of all 
segments of the internally displaced population in the planning and management of the 
resettlement plan should be guaranteed. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Representative recalls the voluntary nature of resettlement or return and 
emphasizes that resettlement opportunities shall be offered in a non-discriminatory 
manner, giving priority to vulnerable cases. IDPs shall be able to make a well-informed 
choice about durable solutions offered to them. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Representative takes note with satisfaction of the adoption, in late July 2008, of 
the Action Plan to implement decree No. 47 of the Government of Georgia &#8220;On Approving 
of the State Strategy for Internally Displaced Persons - Persecuted&#8221; which foresees 
measures aimed at integrating IDPs into mainstream society, in particular by providing 
them with permanent housing or vouchers to acquire such housing. While welcoming the 
shift in Government policy away from considering local reintegration and return to be 
mutually exclusive, the Representative continues to be concerned about the continued lack 
of integration of the &#8220;old&#8221; IDPs. The rights of this group of IDPs need to be ensured in 
tandem with responding to the new group of internally displaced on a non-discriminatory 
basis. The Government should ensure that a holistic approach towards all IDPs is 
developed and implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Representative recommends that the revision and implementation of the Action 
Plan for Internally Displaced Persons adopted in July 2008 - with amendments to account 
for the newly displaced population - is given absolute priority by the Government. He </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/13/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>welcomes the adoption of decrees No. 854 of 4 December 2008 and No. 4 of 
12 January 2009, both of which are aimed at accelerating the finalization of the process of 
revising the Action Plan under the leadership of the Ministry of Refugees and 
Accommodation, so as to swiftly move to its implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Particular attention should be paid to vulnerable groups among the displaced to 
ensure that they are able to fully enjoy their rights. Where required, the implementation 
should provide for humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable displaced persons and 
find durable solutions for those who may not be able to live on their own, such as elderly 
persons without family support. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The issue of formal recognition of the newly displaced as IDPs under relevant 
national legislation and the associated social benefits and legal protection mechanisms 
linked to this status should be addressed, particularly as regards housing and security 
of tenure, as well as protection from forceful eviction from collective centres. The 
Representative welcomes the information provided by the Government, indicating that 
persons displaced as a result of the August 2008 hostilities will be granted IDP status 
during the first quarter of 2009. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>As regards the immediate response to the humanitarian emergency, the 
Representative encourages the authorities to evaluate the lessons learned and to 
strengthen, with the support of the international community, its capacity to efficiently 
address future situations of internal displacement that may be caused by armed conflict 
but also by other events including natural and man-made disasters. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Representative deplores the fact that humanitarian access has become a question 
of political differences between the relevant parties. He is deeply concerned at provisions in 
the Georgian Law on the Occupied Territories which may restrict access to all areas by 
humanitarian actors. He regrets that the current policies of the parties to the conflict have 
prevented him from conducting the planned visit to the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia. 
As indicated previously, he intends to conduct this part of the mission as soon as possible. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Representative urges all parties to agree on a monitoring mechanism to ensure 
the protection of the human rights of the displaced population in all conflict-affected areas. 
As a first step, unimpeded access to all conflict-affected areas should be granted to 
humanitarian actors so that they may reach internally displaced persons and other 
civilians at risk without further delay, and to refrain from any steps that may further 
impede such access. In this context, the Representative refers to the decision of the 
International Court of Justice, in which the Court indicated as one of the provisional 
measures that &#8220;both parties shall facilitate, and refrain from placing any impediments to, 
humanitarian assistance in support of the rights to which the local population are entitled 
under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination&#8221;.32

<p>71. <b>The Representative acknowledges the prompt humanitarian response by the 
international community and the work done by international humanitarian agencies and 
NGOs which has contributed to the prevention of casualties caused by displacement. The 
Representative recommends that the United Nations, humanitarian and development 
organizations and donors:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Continue to support the Government of Georgia in meeting its primary 
responsibility to protect and assist IDPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Continue to support capacity-building within the Government; 
 (c) Continue to provide support and commit resources with a view to addressing 
both the acute humanitarian needs of the newly displaced and the requirement to reach 
durable solutions for both the &#8220;old&#8221; and newly displaced populations, and more specifically 
to implement all the components of the Government&#8217;s new Action Plan for Internally 
Displaced Persons. This would restore hope and dignity for a part of the Georgian 
population that has been marginalized for too long. In this connection, the Representative 
urges the donor community to ensure in particular support for durable solutions for IDPs, 
with a clear protection component.
