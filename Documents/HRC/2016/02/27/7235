<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples pursuant to her mandate under Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 15/14 and 24/9. The Special Rapporteur provides a summary of her activities  
</p>
<p>since her previous report to the Council (A/HRC/27/52) and undertakes a thematic analysis 
</p>
<p>of violations against indigenous women and girls.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation in international conferences 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur participated in a number of international dialogues and 
</p>
<p>conferences: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, with which she coordinated her work, including by 
</p>
<p>holding parallel meetings with indigenous peoples and organizations during their regular 
</p>
<p>sessions;  
</p>
<p> (b) The fourteenth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, held in 
</p>
<p>New York in April and May 2015, during which she shared her views on indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; right to self-determined development and economic, social and cultural rights;  
</p>
<p> (c) The international expert group meeting on an optional protocol to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in January 2015;  
</p>
<p> (d) The first session of the Open-ended intergovernmental working group in 
</p>
<p>charge of elaborating a legally binding instrument on transnational corporations and other 
</p>
<p>business enterprises with respect to human rights, in July 2015, at which she delivered the 
</p>
<p>keynote speech. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>3. From 20 to 28 November 2014, the Special Rapporteur visited Paraguay. She noted 
</p>
<p>that the country had ratified all the core international and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, but observed a number of issues relating to the violations of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, with the foremost concern being the security of their rights to lands, 
</p>
<p>territories and resources.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Report on international investment and trade regimes  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapport will present a thematic report on international investment and 
</p>
<p>free-trade regimes and their impact on the rights of indigenous peoples to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly at its seventieth session.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Rights of indigenous women and girls  
</b></p>
<p>5. Indigenous women experience a broad, multifaceted and complex spectrum of 
</p>
<p>mutually reinforcing human rights abuses. That spectrum is influenced by multiple and 
</p>
<p>intersecting forms of vulnerability, including patriarchal power structures; multiple forms </p>


<p>of discrimination and marginalization, based on gender, class, ethnic origin and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic circumstances; and historical and current violations of the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination and control of resources.  
</p>
<p>6. Despite many barriers to inclusion, indigenous leaders and advocates have made 
</p>
<p>significant strides in achieving recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and perspectives, 
</p>
<p>including the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples, the establishment of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the mandate of 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the Expert Mechanism on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous women actively participated in the processes 
</p>
<p>that gave birth to all those mechanisms and thus feel some ownership over the Declaration 
</p>
<p>and the mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>7. All the provisions of the Declaration apply equally to indigenous women and 
</p>
<p>indigenous men. Article 22 (2) specifically provides that States shall take measures, in 
</p>
<p>conjunction with indigenous peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy 
</p>
<p>the full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination. In the 
</p>
<p>outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as 
</p>
<p>the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, which focused on indigenous women, the 
</p>
<p>participating Heads of State and Government, ministers and representatives of Member 
</p>
<p>States invited the Human Rights Council to consider examining the causes and 
</p>
<p>consequences of violence against indigenous women and girls, in consultation with the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and other special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holders.1 
</p>
<p>8. Despite the progress made, systematic attention to the specific vulnerability of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women has remained limited in relation to the scale of abuses against them. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, what international attention has been given to the issue has not sufficiently 
</p>
<p>focused on the nexus between individual and collective rights, nor on how intersecting 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination and vulnerability contribute to ongoing abuses of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights. That has created a gap that has contributed to ongoing widespread 
</p>
<p>impunity in relation to the rights of indigenous women and girls.  
</p>
<p>9. There have been some promising signs of progress towards closing that gap, such as 
</p>
<p>the efforts taken by indigenous women to empower themselves by establishing their own 
</p>
<p>organizations and networks, and making their issues more visible at national and global 
</p>
<p>levels. Indigenous women&#8217;s participation in the United Nations world conferences on 
</p>
<p>women has increased with time, the highlight being the conference in Beijing in 1995, 
</p>
<p>where participants ensured references to indigenous women and achieved the adoption of 
</p>
<p>the Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women, which has served as a guiding framework in 
</p>
<p>many of their subsequent efforts to build and strengthen their organizations. It must be 
</p>
<p>recognized that the United Nations has established a solid gender equality and women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights regime, which has opened up more possibilities for indigenous women to engage in 
</p>
<p>debates on gender issues. Several Special Rapporteurs, including the previous rapporteurs 
</p>
<p>on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, have contributed through raising awareness of issues facing 
</p>
<p>indigenous women and have made relevant recommendations.  
</p>
<p>10. To contribute to addressing any continuing gaps in monitoring and implementing the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Issues, the Special Rapporteur dedicates the 
</p>
<p>present report to the issue of indigenous women and girl&#8217;s rights. While recognizing the 
</p>
<p>great diversity in the experiences of indigenous women, she will take a global approach, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  See General Assembly resolution 69/2, para. 19. </p>


<p>focusing on common themes and patterns experienced by indigenous women across 
</p>
<p>regions. The Special Rapporteur will highlight examples of specific rights violations and 
</p>
<p>issues from different countries, which are illustrative but not exhaustive. In analysing the 
</p>
<p>situation of indigenous women, she will consider both the gendered forms of violations 
</p>
<p>against indigenous women and the gendered effects of human rights abuses that target 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities as a whole. In that way, the Special Rapporteur hopes that the 
</p>
<p>forms of oppression, discrimination and violence that indigenous women face &#8212;because 
</p>
<p>they are women and because they are indigenous &#8212; can be better understood.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Collective rights  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Self-determination  
</b></p>
<p>11. A cornerstone of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, self-
</p>
<p>determination is defined as both a choice to determine political status, as well as the right to 
</p>
<p>have autonomy over economic, social and cultural development. Self-determination is a 
</p>
<p>right in itself and has been conceptualized as a precondition for the fulfilment of other 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p>12. When examining the rights of indigenous women and girls, it is vital to consider the 
</p>
<p>unique historical experiences of indigenous communities. Many forms of violence and 
</p>
<p>abuse against indigenous women and girls have a strong intergenerational element. 
</p>
<p>Violations of the broad right to self-determination of indigenous peoples are historically 
</p>
<p>and currently endemic. Those have included gross and sustained assaults on the cultural 
</p>
<p>integrity of indigenous peoples; denigration and non-recognition of customary laws and 
</p>
<p>governance systems; failure to develop frameworks that allow indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>appropriate levels of self-governance; and practices that strip indigenous peoples of 
</p>
<p>autonomy over land and natural resources. Those patterns of violations are vividly 
</p>
<p>exemplified by colonization, but have also been perpetuated by post-colonial power 
</p>
<p>structures and State practices. Those violations of the right to self-determination have been 
</p>
<p>highly detrimental to the advancement of the rights of indigenous women and girls in a 
</p>
<p>number of ways.  
</p>
<p>13. The response of indigenous communities to attacks against self-determination has, at 
</p>
<p>times, additionally subjugated the rights of women. In the battle for indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities to assert their right to self-determination, women&#8217;s rights have often been 
</p>
<p>considered divisive and external to the indigenous struggle and connected to &#8220;external 
</p>
<p>values&#8221; or &#8220;Western values&#8221; that privilege individual over communal rights. Such a false 
</p>
<p>dichotomy between collective and women&#8217;s rights has, paradoxically, further entrenched 
</p>
<p>the vulnerability of indigenous women to abuse and violence. Indigenous women are 
</p>
<p>therefore stripped of their right to self-determination by both violations against their 
</p>
<p>collective rights, as members of indigenous communities, and violations against their 
</p>
<p>individual rights, as sub-collectives within those communities.  
</p>
<p>14. Such multiple victimization and the denial of the agency of indigenous women has 
</p>
<p>had a pronounced impact on the prevalence of violence and abuses through the 
</p>
<p>entrenchment of power structures that create and perpetuate systematic vulnerability. The 
</p>
<p>further loss of women&#8217;s agency caused by those violations then negatively impacts 
</p>
<p>collective efforts to fight group rights, thereby contributing to negative cyclical patterns. 
</p>
<p><b>  Land rights  
</b></p>
<p>15. A strong link to the land, territory and natural resources is a characteristic that is 
</p>
<p>commonly associated with indigenous peoples. Despite relevant provisions in international 
</p>
<p>human rights law, indigenous peoples experience weak protection of their land and property </p>


<p>rights, which exposes them to risks of displacement, expropriation and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples inherent the right to the land that they traditionally occupy and use. 
</p>
<p>They often do not hold formal titles to their land and their right to such land is one of the 
</p>
<p>rights most violated. That allows Governments to impose destructive development projects 
</p>
<p>or to lease and sell indigenous land without obtaining their free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent. Large-scale economic projects have been constructed on indigenous lands. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, mass tourism has been encouraged in areas that are of significance to 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. The implementation of those projects has repeatedly caused forced 
</p>
<p>displacement and migration, ecological degradation and armed conflicts. Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>commodification of land that is inherent in such practices is an assault on indigenous 
</p>
<p>cultures and the importance placed on land.  
</p>
<p>16. Land appropriation is not gender neutral and indigenous women&#8217;s rights interact 
</p>
<p>with violations of collective land rights. In indigenous communities where matriarchy and 
</p>
<p>matrilineal practices exist, the loss of land will likewise undermine indigenous women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>status and roles. The gendered effects of those violations become manifest in situations 
</p>
<p>where indigenous women lose their traditional livelihoods, such as food gathering, 
</p>
<p>agricultural production, herding, among others, while compensation and jobs following 
</p>
<p>land seizure tend to benefit male members of indigenous communities. The loss of land and 
</p>
<p>exclusion of women can create vulnerability to abuse and violence, such as sexual violence, 
</p>
<p>exploitation and trafficking. Additionally, the secondary effects of violations of land rights, 
</p>
<p>such as loss of livelihood and ill health, often disproportionally impact women in their roles 
</p>
<p>of caregivers and guardians of the local environment.  
</p>
<p>17. External threats to indigenous land rights are not the only cause of abuses of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights in relation to land. The roles that women hold within indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities and the way that some indigenous property frameworks reflect patriarchal 
</p>
<p>power structures. Indigenous women commonly experience significant barriers to holding 
</p>
<p>and inheriting land. especially when they are widowed.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Poverty  
</b></p>
<p>18. Indigenous peoples account for 5 per cent of the world&#8217;s population, while 
</p>
<p>representing 15 per cent of those living in poverty. As many as 33 per cent of all people 
</p>
<p>living in extreme rural poverty globally are from indigenous communities.2 Those figures 
</p>
<p>are particularly alarming given the wealth of natural resources that are located within 
</p>
<p>indigenous territories. That level of poverty is a violation of indigenous people&#8217;s rights to 
</p>
<p>development, as well as their economic and social rights to an adequate standard of living, 
</p>
<p>housing, food, water, health and education. Such poverty is deeply interrelated with abuses 
</p>
<p>of land and self-determination. The denial of self-determination in relation to development 
</p>
<p>pathways and control over natural resources is also a central causal factor in the prevalence 
</p>
<p>of poverty among indigenous communities. It is related to and mutually reinforced by the 
</p>
<p>exclusion of indigenous people&#8217;s perspective and agency from dominant development 
</p>
<p>paradigms. 
</p>
<p>19. High unemployment is an important issue in relation to the poverty experienced by 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities, as indigenous peoples are disproportionally represented within the 
</p>
<p>world&#8217;s unemployed. When indigenous people are employed they often face wage 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), <i>Sustaining human progress: reducing 
</i></p>
<p><i>vulnerabilities and building resistance</i>, Human Development Report 2014, p. 3.   </p>


<p>discrimination and exploitation in the workforce, which further fuels poverty. The 
</p>
<p>following are some examples of those trends: 
</p>
<p> (a) In Australia, the indigenous unemployment rate was 15.6 per cent in 2006, 
</p>
<p>that is, just over three times higher than the non-indigenous unemployment rate, while the 
</p>
<p>median indigenous income was around half of the non-indigenous income;  
</p>
<p> (b) In the western provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta and 
</p>
<p>Saskatchewan, Canada, unemployment among indigenous people was as high as 13.6 per 
</p>
<p>cent, but stood at only 5.3 per cent among the non-indigenous population;  
</p>
<p> (c ) In New Zealand, the unemployment rate for the Maori is more than twice as 
</p>
<p>high as the national average (7.7 per cent compared to 3.8 per cent) and the income of 
</p>
<p>indigenous households is 70 per cent that of the national average.3  
</p>
<p>20. Some of the poverty reduction initiatives put in place to support indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities are not always culturally sensitive and are therefore ineffective. For example, 
</p>
<p>the practice of providing conditional cash transfers to poor indigenous families in exchange 
</p>
<p>for compliance with preconditions, such as sending their children to school or requiring 
</p>
<p>pregnant women to go for check-ups and to deliver in rural clinics or hospitals. Such 
</p>
<p>practices have tended to be blind to the cultural values of indigenous peoples and also do 
</p>
<p>not address the specific root causes of poverty. 
</p>
<p>21. Indigenous women are directly affected by poverty and weaknesses in programmes 
</p>
<p>designed to tackle it, as well as by unemployment trends and wage-related discrimination. 
</p>
<p>The multiple forms of discrimination, based on gender, age, socioeconomic situation and 
</p>
<p>ethnic origin, experienced by indigenous women make them highly vulnerable to poverty. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the overall poverty experienced by indigenous peoples tends to have a 
</p>
<p>disproportionate impact on women, due to their role as caregivers and managers of 
</p>
<p>resources. 
</p>
<p><b>  Right to food  
</b></p>
<p>22. Food insecurity is not well-managed or understood within indigenous peoples due to 
</p>
<p>a severe lack of relevant data. However it is widely recognized that indigenous people 
</p>
<p>experience significant food insecurity and therefore suffer with widespread violations of 
</p>
<p>their right to food. A range of interconnected and mutually reinforcing factors contributes 
</p>
<p>to significant levels of food insecurity. As identified by the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations, loss of a culture, land and insecure access to lands, 
</p>
<p>territories and natural resource have been key drivers of this phenomenon amongst 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. Like poverty, violations of the right to food affect indigenous 
</p>
<p>women directly and also have a disproportionate impact on them because of their roles as 
</p>
<p>food and water providers, caregivers and managers of resources.  
</p>
<p>23. There is an emerging trend whereby indigenous peoples&#8217; lands are being grabbed by 
</p>
<p>political and business actors who want to set up industrial food production farms or lands 
</p>
<p>for production of biofuels, such as sugar cane and jatropha. Indigenous peoples&#8217; livelihoods 
</p>
<p>such as rotational agriculture, pastoralism, hunting and gathering which have ensured food 
</p>
<p>security for them are now increasingly being threatened. These have lead to the destruction 
</p>
<p>of indigenous women&#8217;s livelihoods that are land-based.

<p><b>  Right to education  
</b></p>
<p>24. Indigenous peoples, in particular women, tend to have low levels of educational 
</p>
<p>attainment and literacy compared with non-indigenous populations. That situation is a 
</p>
<p>violation of the right to everyone to an education. Such violations of the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous persons to an education are multi-dimensional and brings into consideration the 
</p>
<p>issues of access, quality and inclusion.  
</p>
<p>25. Indigenous children&#8217;s inability to access education is generally caused by the 
</p>
<p>geographical and political marginalization of indigenous communities. When education is 
</p>
<p>available, it is often blind to the specific needs of indigenous children. Curricula are often 
</p>
<p>not taught in indigenous languages, which undermines indigenous children&#8217;s ability to 
</p>
<p>achieve school readiness and express their cultural identity in school. National school 
</p>
<p>curricula tend to have very little, if any, focus on indigenous peoples, their issues and 
</p>
<p>histories. Some national curricula even reinforce negative cultural stereotypes about 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and indigenous students frequently find that the education provided by 
</p>
<p>the State promotes individualism and a competitive atmosphere, rather than communal 
</p>
<p>ways of life and cooperation. It is also common for indigenous children to experience 
</p>
<p>racism and discrimination and ethnically motivated bullying in school. Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>education available to indigenous children is not always of adequate quality. The physical 
</p>
<p>buildings in which indigenous children are educated can also fail to be fit for purpose, and 
</p>
<p>teaching staff and materials may also be of poor quality.4  
</p>
<p>26. Some indigenous peoples prefer to set up their own indigenous schools, which 
</p>
<p>ensure that traditional knowledge holders are involved in teaching and their culture is 
</p>
<p>valued. In some countries, indigenous peoples initiate the setting up of schools because the 
</p>
<p>State does not provide schooling in their communities owing to the remoteness of the 
</p>
<p>location or the small population size. The Special Rapporteur noted that in some indigenous 
</p>
<p>territories which have become sites of armed conflicts, the army or paramilitary personnel 
</p>
<p>occupy schools, which are therefore required to close down.  
</p>
<p>27. As a result of those factors, indigenous children often experience significant gaps in 
</p>
<p>educational attainment compared with non-indigenous populations and dropout rates are 
</p>
<p>high among indigenous children. For example, in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Ecuador, 
</p>
<p>Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, there is an average gap of three years between indigenous 
</p>
<p>and non-indigenous children in relation to the schooling undertaken by those aged 15 or 
</p>
<p>older. Those trends are mirrored in other countries with indigenous populations. The gaps 
</p>
<p>between indigenous and non-indigenous educational attainment are also reflected in the 
</p>
<p>proportion of those attending post-secondary education institutions.5  
</p>
<p>28. In that connection, indigenous girls tend to be more disadvantaged than indigenous 
</p>
<p>boys.6 In additional to the factors impacting overall indigenous dropout rates, girls can 
</p>
<p>experience a number of additional barriers. Firstly, their role within communities often 
</p>
<p>means that they are expected to help with domestic and care responsibilities. Secondly, 
</p>
<p>indigenous girls may also be subjected to child marriage, so that their roles as wives and 
</p>

<p>sometimes child bearers mean that they have to leave school. Thirdly, indigenous girls may 
</p>
<p>face the risk of sexual violence and rape during long journeys to school, as evidenced in the 
</p>
<p>report of the Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and in Practice on 
</p>
<p>its visit to Peru.7 The significance of this barrier to education is exacerbated by the presence 
</p>
<p>of legislation in some States that prohibits women and girls from being able to seek 
</p>
<p>abortion services, even if they become pregnant following rape.8 
</p>
<p><b>  Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>29. There are examples of profound physical and mental health inequalities between 
</p>
<p>indigenous and non-indigenous people. For example: 
</p>
<p> (a) In the United States of America, a Native American is 600 times more likely 
</p>
<p>to contract tuberculosis than a non-Native American;  
</p>
<p> (b) Worldwide, over 50 per cent of indigenous adults suffer from type 2 diabetes;  
</p>
<p> (c) Indigenous peoples&#8217; life expectancy is up to 20 years lower than their non-
</p>
<p>indigenous counterparts;  
</p>
<p> (d) Indigenous peoples experience disproportionately high levels of maternal and 
</p>
<p>infant mortality, malnutrition, cardiovascular illnesses, HIV/AIDS and other infectious 
</p>
<p>diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis;  
</p>
<p> (e) Suicide rates of indigenous peoples, particularly among youth, are 
</p>
<p>considerably higher in many countries. For example, the suicide rate for Inuit in Canada is 
</p>
<p>around 11 times the national average; 
</p>
<p> (f) Child mortality rates among indigenous communities are usually above the 
</p>
<p>national average.9  
</p>
<p>30. Many of those poor health outcomes are influenced by modifiable risk factors, such 
</p>
<p>as drug abuse, poor nutrition and alcoholism, which have worryingly increased within 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. The increase in risk factors has been identified as being strongly 
</p>
<p>connected with the historical colonization and dispossession of indigenous peoples, which 
</p>
<p>has resulted in the fragmentation of their social, cultural, economic and political 
</p>
<p>institutions.10 
</p>
<p>31. Against the backdrop of growing physical and mental health concerns, non-
</p>
<p>indigenous health systems often do not take into account the indigenous concept of health, 
</p>
<p>and therefore create barriers to access by indigenous people. Epidemiological data often 
</p>
<p>fails to capture information on indigenous communities and the socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>determinants of health, thereby making them &#8220;invisible&#8221;. If data is included, it is generally 
</p>
<p>not disaggregated, so that the specific needs of indigenous women are not understood in the 
</p>
<p>context of national healthcare policy and planning. In addition, there are often no clear 
</p>
<p>integration mechanisms for health care personnel, communities, traditional healers, policy 
</p>
<p>makers and government officials. Furthermore, the facilities available to indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities and women are also often not suitable to their specific needs and cultural 
</p>
<p>preferences.  
</p>
<p>32. Women acutely feel the low levels of health within indigenous communities. They 
</p>
<p>are disproportionately affected by illness owing to reduced coping capacity caused by the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>denial of broader rights. Women also play a primary role in overseeing the health and well-
</p>
<p>being of their families and communities, and can be particularly affected by the suffering of 
</p>
<p>children and other family members. Their gender and role as child-bearers also make them 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to specific health difficulties. 
</p>
<p>33. A grave gender-specific health concern is the issue of indigenous women&#8217;s sexual 
</p>
<p>and reproductive health. Indigenous women face many barriers to sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>rights, such as a lack of culturally appropriate sexual and reproductive health advice, 
</p>
<p>geographical access to facilities and lack of supplies, such as contraceptives, poor quality 
</p>
<p>care and, in some cases, legislation banning abortion services, even in cases of pregnancy 
</p>
<p>following rape. That leads to higher-than-average maternal mortality rates; disproportionate 
</p>
<p>representation of indigenous girls in teenage pregnancy indexes; low voluntary 
</p>
<p>contraceptive usage; and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>34. There have also been severe historical violations of indigenous women&#8217;s rights in 
</p>
<p>relation to sexual and reproductive rights in the context of denial of their rights to self-
</p>
<p>determination and cultural autonomy. Those violations include forced sterilization of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women and attempts to force indigenous women to have children with non-
</p>
<p>indigenous men as part of policies of cultural assimilation. Indigenous women may also 
</p>
<p>face barriers to preventive services that support their right to health, such as screening for 
</p>
<p>ovarian and breast cancer. 
</p>
<p><b>  Cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>35. Abuses of indigenous people&#8217;s cultural rights are endemic, owing to a sustained 
</p>
<p>unwillingness on the part of many States to celebrate indigenous culture or to promote the 
</p>
<p>use of indigenous languages in schools as part of the cultural diversity of citizens within 
</p>
<p>their borders. That has a cross-cutting effect on the rights of indigenous women and 
</p>
<p>children. Lack of respect for indigenous cultures is evident across all violations of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and is a fundamental part of the experiences of indigenous women and 
</p>
<p>girls. The commodification of the cultures and cultural heritage of indigenous peoples is a 
</p>
<p>common experience for many indigenous peoples. For example, indigenous territories have 
</p>
<p>been declared World Heritage Sites without their free, prior and informed consent, thereby 
</p>
<p>turning them into tourist areas. In most cases, the people who reap the biggest benefits are 
</p>
<p>foreign or national travel and tour agencies or hotel owners. In those cases, indigenous 
</p>
<p>women often end up as menial employees or entertainers for tourists. At worst, prostitution 
</p>
<p>is encouraged and criminal syndicates promote trafficking of indigenous women and girls.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Civil and political rights  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Racism and racially motivated discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>36. As indicated in the concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, indigenous peoples face persistent and multifaceted forms of racism 
</p>
<p>and racial discrimination. Such discrimination is intimately interconnected and mutually 
</p>
<p>reinforcing with the spectrum of violations experienced by indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>37. Indigenous women and girls experience racism and racial discrimination as 
</p>
<p>members of indigenous communities. Such violations of their rights also increase their 
</p>
<p>vulnerability to other human rights abuses, as they are part of the intersecting forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and inequality that they face.  
</p>
<p><b>  Participation in public and political life  
</b></p>
<p>38. Indigenous women have the right, to participate in public and political decision-
</p>
<p>making processes. That right stems broadly from the right to self-determination, as well as </p>


<p>from the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women. However, in reality, indigenous women are often excluded from both 
</p>
<p>indigenous decision-making structures and local and national political processes in States. 
</p>
<p>As highlighted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p>there are very few indigenous women in national and local political processes and in some 
</p>
<p>countries, there are none at all.11 Indigenous power structures and self-governance 
</p>
<p>agreements tend to be patriarchal and exclude the involvement and perspectives of women.  
</p>
<p>39. Female indigenous human rights defenders have faced particular challenges when 
</p>
<p>exercising their right to participate in public life. Female human rights defenders play a 
</p>
<p>vital role in protecting women in indigenous communities and can be valuable resources to 
</p>
<p>States in the context of balancing their duty to protect all women and the need to respect the 
</p>
<p>right to self-determination and autonomy of indigenous communities. However, in a 
</p>
<p>number of countries, the activities of female human rights defenders from indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities have been criminalized and they have been subjected to severe forms of 
</p>
<p>violence. For example, in Oaxaca, Mexico, female human rights defenders were reported to 
</p>
<p>have been killed recently.12  
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenous women and criminal justice 
</b></p>
<p>40. Data and comprehensive comparative research on indigenous women and the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system are very underdeveloped. However, reports suggest that indigenous 
</p>
<p>women are overrepresented in the criminal justice systems and the number of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women in custody is increasing in a number of countries, including Australia, Canada and 
</p>
<p>New Zealand. What limited data is available suggests that the incarceration of women is 
</p>
<p>increasing at a significantly quicker rate than that of men. Some relevant statistics include 
</p>
<p>the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Estimates suggest that Maori women in New Zealand represent 40 to 60 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the female prison population, while the Maori people represent around 15 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the general population;13  
</p>
<p> (b) Maori women were also overrepresented for imprisonment and intensive 
</p>
<p>supervision (accounting for 51 per cent of sentences imposed) and underrepresented for 
</p>
<p>more lenient dispositions, such as reparation orders (39 per cent) and fines and discharges 
</p>
<p>(both 33 per cent);14 
</p>
<p> (c) In 2010, 30 per cent of incarcerated women in Australia were reported to be 
</p>
<p>indigenous;15  
</p>
<p> (d) Between 2000 and 2010, in Australia, the imprisonment rate for women 
</p>
<p>increased by 60 per cent, compared to 35 per cent for men;16  
</p>
<p> (e) From 1996/97 to 2001/02, in Canada, the number of federally sentenced 
</p>
<p>aboriginal women increased by 36.7 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent for aboriginal 
</p>
<p>men.17

<p>41. Those trends have a number of implications in relation to the human rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women and girls. When looked at through a human rights lens, it is clear that 
</p>
<p>many indigenous women and girls have difficulties with the law because of prior violations 
</p>
<p>of their human rights. Issues associated with disregard for collective and individual 
</p>
<p>indigenous rights &#8212; such as abuse of women, mental health problems and poverty &#8212; have 
</p>
<p>been identified as causal factors in criminal behaviour among indigenous women. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, issues relating to indigenous women&#8217;s access to justice, as discussed below, 
</p>
<p>must be considered within criminal justice.  
</p>
<p>42. Indigenous women may also be more vulnerable than non-indigenous women once 
</p>
<p>they are in detention. There have been reports of a lack of women&#8217;s facilities to 
</p>
<p>accommodate indigenous women, which means that they could be housed with men. That 
</p>
<p>leaves them vulnerable to violence and unable to access gender-specific programmes and 
</p>
<p>support. There have also been reports of racism and discrimination against indigenous 
</p>
<p>women in prisons, as well as inadequate access to health services. 
</p>
<p><b>  Right to remedy  
</b></p>
<p>43. Indigenous women are routinely denied their right to remedy for abuses of their 
</p>
<p>human rights. There is a historical and group dimension to the denial of women&#8217;s right to 
</p>
<p>remedy. The failure of Governments to acknowledge and provide remedy for historical 
</p>
<p>abuses of indigenous communities contributes to the ongoing vulnerability of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p>44. Currently, in numerous countries, indigenous women are marginalized in both 
</p>
<p>national and indigenous justice systems. At the national level, judicial remedies and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms are often not available to indigenous women owing to a range of cultural and 
</p>
<p>linguistic factors. Indigenous justice systems, on the other hand, tend to be male dominated 
</p>
<p>and do not always allow adequate space for women&#8217;s voices or participation. While 
</p>
<p>customary or informal justice systems differ from one indigenous community to another, 
</p>
<p>they may fail to offer genuine recourse to justice. For example, the Aboriginal Justice 
</p>
<p>Inquiry of Manitoba, Canada, identified bias in favour of the male partner in indigenous 
</p>
<p>domestic abuse situations and criticized Chiefs and Councils for being unwilling to address 
</p>
<p>the plight of women suffering abuse at the hands of husbands or partners.  
</p>
<p>45. The challenges facing indigenous women in seeking justice can be complicated by 
</p>
<p>the increase in private forms of remedy for violations perpetrated by business-related 
</p>
<p>actors. As reported by MiningWatch Canada and Amnesty International at the third annual 
</p>
<p>Forum on Business and Human Rights, held in 2014, private companies often offer women 
</p>
<p>who have been victims of extreme violence, such as gang rape, access to corporate-led 
</p>
<p>grievance mechanisms. A precondition for accessing such mechanisms is signing an 
</p>
<p>agreement not to sue the company, so that judicial remedy is blocked. There have been 
</p>
<p>reported cases of women receiving compensation that was shockingly disproportionate to 
</p>
<p>the severity of the violations of their human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Multiple forms of violence  
</b></p>
<p>46. The issue of violence against women is indivisibly linked to the categories of rights 
</p>
<p>discussed above. In fact, the endemic violations of collective, civil and political, and 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights can be seen as constituting a form of structural violence 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 Native Women&#8217;s Association of Canada, &#8220;Aboriginal women and the legal justice system&#8221; (see 
</p>
<p>footnote 13).  </p>


<p>against indigenous women and girls. Structural violence results in women being victimized 
</p>
<p>by the realities of the circumstances of their everyday life and routinely excluded from the 
</p>
<p>rights and resources otherwise guaranteed to citizens. Structural violence is interlinked and 
</p>
<p>mutually reinforcing with other forms of violence, as discussed below.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sexual violence  
</b></p>
<p>47. Indigenous women are significantly more likely to experience rape than non-
</p>
<p>indigenous women. It has been estimated that more than one in three indigenous women are 
</p>
<p>raped during their lifetime. Behind these shocking statistics are multiple forms of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence against indigenous women by a multitude of actors in different geographical 
</p>
<p>regions. Coordinated and comparative information on sexual violence is very limited, due 
</p>
<p>in part to significant underreporting and a lack of investment in disaggregated data 
</p>
<p>collection that include indigenous women and communities. That makes analysis of 
</p>
<p>systemic level prevalence and trends very difficult. Different forms of sexual violence have 
</p>
<p>been reported, including the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Rape, which can be perpetrated by individuals known to the indigenous 
</p>
<p>woman and girl, as a form of control, punishment and/or abuse; 
</p>
<p> (b) Large numbers of indigenous women and girls work in domestic households. 
</p>
<p>Domestic work is outside of the regulatory framework for employers, which leaves women 
</p>
<p>and girls isolated and vulnerable to rape and abuse by employers; 
</p>
<p> (c) Women have reportedly been subjected to harassment, extortion and rape by 
</p>
<p>State officials at border crossings. For example, Miskito women, whose territories straddle 
</p>
<p>Nicaragua and Honduras and who cross national borders every day to work their lands or to 
</p>
<p>gather medicinal plants, are routinely exposed to sexual violence. In addition, military 
</p>
<p>officials may perpetrate sexual violence as a weapon to weaken the resolve of indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities in militarized disputes over land and resources; 
</p>
<p> (d) In the United States, large numbers of indigenous women have experienced 
</p>
<p>rape perpetrated by men outside of their communities. According to  statistics, Native 
</p>
<p>American and Alaska Native women are more than 2.5 times more likely to be raped or 
</p>
<p>sexually assaulted than other women in the United States; and 86 per cent of the reported 
</p>
<p>cases of rape or sexual assault against American Indian and Alaska Native women are 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by non-Native men; 
</p>
<p> (e) Indigenous women have reportedly been subjected to sexual violence by men 
</p>
<p>from other indigenous groups. In the Great Lakes Region of Africa, one Batwa woman 
</p>
<p>reported that Bantu men violated Pygmy women from the Congo, claiming that they did it 
</p>
<p>to treat medical complaints;  
</p>
<p> (f) There have been reports from NGOs that indigenous women have been raped 
</p>
<p>by individual and multiple perpetrators in the context of business activities on indigenous 
</p>
<p>lands.18 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 See, for example, Mairin Iwanka Raya: <i>Indigenous women stand against violence: a companion 
</i></p>
<p><i>report to the United Nations Secretary-</i>General&#8217;s study o<i>n violence against women</i> (International 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Women&#8217;s Forum, 2006); Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, State of the world&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><i>Indigenous peoples</i>, 2010; UN-Women and others, <i>Breaking the silence</i> (see footnote 4); Amnesty 
</p>
<p>International, <i>Maze of injustice: the failure to protect Indigenous women from sexual violence in the

<p><i>USA</i>, (New York, 2007); and Reports from non-governmental organizations to the 2014 United 
</p>
<p>Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights. </p>


<p>48. The variety of forms of sexual violence reflects, to some extent, the different 
</p>
<p>experiences of indigenous women and girls around the world. It also reflects the 
</p>
<p>multidimensional ways in which indigenous women are vulnerable to violence and the 
</p>
<p>severe threat of revictimization.  
</p>
<p><b>  Gender-based killings  
</b></p>
<p>49. Gender-based killings have been defined by the Special Rapporteur on violence 
</p>
<p>against women, its causes and consequences, in her 2012 report (A/HRC/20/16), as direct 
</p>
<p>or indirect gender-motivated killings, which take place in the family, in communities and 
</p>
<p>which are sometimes perpetrated or condoned by States through act and/or omission. She 
</p>
<p>describes such killings as an extreme form of violence, which is part of a continuum of 
</p>
<p>violence that is influenced by the sources of structural vulnerability in place in women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>lives. In her report, the Special Rapporteur described how the phenomenon can impact 
</p>
<p>indigenous women, as a result of their social, cultural, economic and political 
</p>
<p>marginalization and oppression that culminates in violence. Gender-based killings of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women can take a variety of forms, including murder within communities; 
</p>
<p>retaliation for defending their human rights; conflict-related; in the context of displacement 
</p>
<p>from their communities due to dispossession of land; reports of &#8220;missing women&#8221; who are 
</p>
<p>assumed to have been killed. 
</p>
<p>50. The Native Women&#8217;s Association of Canada and Amnesty International document 
</p>
<p>and report cases of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada. Those 
</p>
<p>reports have been submitted to the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Inter-American Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, as well as to the previous and current Special Rapporteurs on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. Statistics from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in 2014, indicate 
</p>
<p>that indigenous women are four times more likely to be murdered than non-indigenous 
</p>
<p>women. The report also states that 1,017 indigenous women and girls were murdered 
</p>
<p>between 1980 and 2012.19 The bodies mentioned above have put forward several 
</p>
<p>recommendations, including the following: (a) a national action plan to end violence 
</p>
<p>against indigenous women, which addresses the root causes of violence and identifies 
</p>
<p>holistic, culturally-appropriate ways to prevent violence and support those affected by 
</p>
<p>violence; (b) a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, 
</p>
<p>focusing on exposing the nature of that form of violence and on ensuring Government and 
</p>
<p>police accountability for an effective and coordinated response; and (c) regular, 
</p>
<p>comprehensive data collection on violence against indigenous women in official crime 
</p>
<p>statistics. Unfortunately, the long-awaited national public inquiry has not yet taken place. 
</p>
<p>As recommended by the previous Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Canadian 
</p>
<p>Government should undertake a full, independent inquiry into the cases of missing and 
</p>
<p>murdered aboriginal women and girls. 20 
</p>
<p><b>  Violence in the context of conflict  
</b></p>
<p>51. Indigenous women are often caught in the crossfire of conflict situations and 
</p>
<p>subjected to militarized violence. Conflicts may be between different ethnic groups and 
</p>
<p>may also involve government forces and business actors. Indigenous women and girls have 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 Royal Canadian Mounted Police, <i>Missing and murdered aboriginal women: a national operational 
</i></p>
<p><i>overview</i>, 2014.

<p>been victims of gender-based violence in conflicts for example in Colombia, Guatemala, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>52. As noted by the Rapporteur on the Rights of Women of the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, the situation of indigenous women and girls is particularly 
</p>
<p>critical in the context of armed conflict, given that they are already exposed to multiple 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination. That again shows the impact that intersecting forms of inequality 
</p>
<p>and discrimination can have on indigenous women. 
</p>
<p>53. Examples of violence against women in a military context include the following:  
</p>
<p> (a) In Colombia, indigenous women and girls are commonly subjected to 
</p>
<p>patterns of rape, forced prostitution and exploitation in the context of occupation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous land;  
</p>
<p> (b) In Bangladesh, indigenous women face multiple forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>there is a high prevalence of sexual violence, including as a weapon in community conflict 
</p>
<p>in rural areas; 
</p>
<p> (c) In the States of Karen, Karenni, Mon and Shan, Myanmar, indigenous 
</p>
<p>women are in daily contact with the soldiers of the Burmese army that occupies the area. 
</p>
<p>The Rapporteur has found that rape of indigenous women is not only a form of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;entertainment&#8221; for the soldiers, but part of a strategy to demoralize and weaken the 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. Soldiers reportedly use rape to coerce women into marriage and 
</p>
<p>to impregnate women as part of the forced cultural assimilation policy; 
</p>
<p> (d) In Fiji, India, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste, 
</p>
<p>the militarization of conflict over indigenous land has led to gang-rape, sexual enslavement 
</p>
<p>and killing of tribal women and girls; 
</p>
<p> (e) There have been reports of indigenous women in the Democratic Republic of 
</p>
<p>the Congo being victims of rape by armed groups and the military; 
</p>
<p> (f) In north-western Kenya, British soldiers stationed in the area since the 1980s 
</p>
<p>have reportedly raped more than 1,400 Masai and Samburu women. Rape survivors and 
</p>
<p>their families still suffer from the legacy of those attacks, such as stigmatization of families 
</p>
<p>with mixed-race children.21  
</p>
<p><b>  Violence in the name of tradition  
</b></p>
<p>54. As discussed by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
</p>
<p>consequences in her 2007 thematic report, culture-based identity politics can be used to 
</p>
<p>justify violence against women in the name of traditional practices and/or values.22 
</p>
<p>Practices commonly carried out in the name of tradition, such as female gender mutilation 
</p>
<p>and child marriage, impact some but not all indigenous communities. The fact that those 
</p>
<p>traditional practices cut across religious, geographical and ethnic characteristics 
</p>
<p>demonstrate that there are multidimensional causal factors and that no one factor attributed 
</p>
<p>to the identity of women makes them vulnerable. Violations suffered by indigenous women 
</p>
<p>and girls must be viewed within the context of the broad spectrum of violations experienced 
</p>
<p>and their specific vulnerabilities as members of indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>55. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 100 million and 140 
</p>
<p>million women and girls worldwide have been subjected to female gender mutilation.

<p>Female genital mutilation has been documented mainly in Africa, but also in some 
</p>
<p>countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America. As recognized by 
</p>
<p>WHO, there are no benefits to female genital mutilation; in fact, the procedure can have 
</p>
<p>many negative consequences for women, including infection, complications in childbirth, 
</p>
<p>pain, infertility and cysts, as well as their overall disempowerment within society. There is 
</p>
<p>very little information about the prevalence and drivers of female genital mutilation among 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities, but it is known to take place in some but not all indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>56. Similarly, little disaggregated information is available about the specific dynamics 
</p>
<p>of child marriage in indigenous communities, but it is known to take place in some 
</p>
<p>communities. Much of the literature on child marriage demonstrates a strong link with 
</p>
<p>poverty, therefore, the broader human rights violations of indigenous women and girls are 
</p>
<p>likely to be strong causal factors for child marriage. Child marriage is not only a form of 
</p>
<p>violence, but also a violation of the child&#8217;s rights to education and family life. Child 
</p>
<p>marriage can also lead to violations of the rights to life and health, as young girls often 
</p>
<p>experience complications with pregnancy and childbirth, which can result in death. In 
</p>
<p>addition, child marriage creates vulnerability to marital rape.23 
</p>
<p><b>  Domestic violence  
</b></p>
<p>57. Information on domestic violence is limited due to underreporting and lack of 
</p>
<p>investment in data collection. Nonetheless, available data suggests that indigenous women 
</p>
<p>are significantly more likely to be victims of domestic violence than non-indigenous 
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p>58. Domestic violence can have grave consequences for victims, including mental health 
</p>
<p>problems, substance abuse, severe health issues and difficulties in providing care to 
</p>
<p>children. Those consequences may be felt more acutely by indigenous women owing to 
</p>
<p>lack of access to support services and justice, as well as their specific cultural and economic 
</p>
<p>circumstances.  
</p>
<p>59. Domestic violence must be considered within the context of the broader human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses of indigenous communities. A number of potential root causes have been 
</p>
<p>identified, many of which are linked to human rights issues specific to indigenous peoples 
</p>
<p>and historical violations of their rights, including a violent family environment; abusive 
</p>
<p>State policies at a young age; financial problems and poverty; unemployment; lack of 
</p>
<p>education; poor physical and mental health; racism-induced stress; denial of rights to self-
</p>
<p>determination, land and culture, among others, leading to loss of identity and self-esteem; 
</p>
<p>and a breakdown of community kinship systems and Aboriginal law. While nothing can 
</p>
<p>negate domestic violence, which is a serious crime, strategies for its reduction and 
</p>
<p>elimination must take into account both its  causes and consequences through a holistic and 
</p>
<p>human rights-based lens. Interventions such as support and recovery services must also be 
</p>
<p>sensitive to the specific needs of indigenous women and girls. 
</p>
<p><b>  Trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>60. Compelled by economic need, armed conflict and denial of self-determination and 
</p>
<p>land rights in the context of major economic development projects, many indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples migrate from their home communities in rural areas to urban centres. Indigenous 
</p>
<p>women and girls who leave their communities are highly vulnerable to trafficking, which 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23  See Human Rights Watch, section on child marriage, available at www.hrw.org/topic/womens-
</p>
<p>rights/child-marriage. </p>


<p>can lead to multiple violations of their human rights, including severe economic and sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation and sexual violence. There are also cases of indigenous women being targeted 
</p>
<p>by organized traffickers within their own communities. Reports of trafficking of indigenous 
</p>
<p>women and children include the following:  
</p>
<p> (a) In the Miskitu communities of Nicaragua, indigenous women have reported 
</p>
<p>the phenomenon of selling and trafficking of indigenous girls and boys, citing 
</p>
<p>communitarian violence as the cause;  
</p>
<p> (b) In a number of Asian countries, including Cambodia, India, Nepal and 
</p>
<p>Thailand, indigenous women are trafficked from their communities into domestic servitude 
</p>
<p>or forced prostitution; 
</p>
<p> (c) Trafficking of indigenous women for the purpose of exploitation has been 
</p>
<p>reported in Mexico; 
</p>
<p> (d) Indigenous women in Canada are reported to be at a greater risk of trafficking 
</p>
<p>for the purposes of sexual exploitation than non-indigenous women.24 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Key challenges and promising practices  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Key challenges  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Gaps and weaknesses in monitoring systems and implementation 
</b></p>
<p>61. Systematic analysis of the conclusions of United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>conducted for this report showed significant gaps and weaknesses in relation to the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous women and girls. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the attention of other 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and agencies, in particular special procedures mandate holders, treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-
</p>
<p>Women), and hopes that the developing focus on indigenous women&#8217;s rights continues to 
</p>
<p>grow.  
</p>
<p>62. Gaps and weaknesses in some human rights and development monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanisms include:  
</p>
<p> (a) The lack of geographical balance in relation to the comments made by the 
</p>
<p>different mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> (b) Failure to discuss the role that intersecting forms of vulnerability and 
</p>
<p>discrimination plays in violations of the rights of indigenous women and girls; 
</p>
<p> (c) Limited exploration of the nexus between individual and collective rights; 
</p>
<p> (d) The absence of gender analysis when discussing issues that impact 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>63. Similarly, a number of development and other policy mechanisms, including the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals, the proposed sustainable development goals and the 
</p>
<p>Beijing Platform for Action, have given disproportionally low attention relative to needs. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 24 See, for example, Mairin Iwanka Raya: <i>Indigenous women stand against violence</i> (see footnote 18); 
</p>
<p>Arun Kumar Acharya and Manuel R. Barragan Codina, &#8220;Poverty and trafficking of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>women in Mexico: some evidence from Chiapas State&#8221;, <i>Journal of Sustainable Society</i>, vol. 1, No. 3, 
</p>
<p>2012, pp. 63-69; and Native Women on Canada Association, <i>Sexual exploitation and trafficking of 
</i></p>
<p><i>aboriginal women and girls</i>, Literature review and key informant interviews (March 2014). </p>


<p>64. These gaps and weaknesses in the monitoring and implementation of the human 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples contribute to a culture of impunity and render the violations of 
</p>
<p>rights invisible to international and national policy makers and legislators.     
</p>
<p><b>  A lack of disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>65. The effects of those gaps and weaknesses in monitoring are compounded by 
</p>
<p>systemic weaknesses in national data collection systems in relation to understanding 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. There is the lack of disaggregated population data, which includes 
</p>
<p>statistics on indigenous women within these groups. In addition, specific information on 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, including those perpetrated against women, is rarely available. 
</p>
<p>That has impeded understanding and comparison of situations of indigenous women and 
</p>
<p>girls, as well as the development of clear accountability structures. Deficiencies in 
</p>
<p>understanding and accountability are powerful barriers to effective strategies for 
</p>
<p>combatting violations of indigenous women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  A lack of inclusive birth registration systems 
</b></p>
<p>66. Many countries do not have birth registration systems that robustly provide 
</p>
<p>certification of the births of all indigenous children, which exacerbates the lack of 
</p>
<p>monitoring and disaggregated data. Such lack of birth registration systems places 
</p>
<p>indigenous children and people in a situation of increased vulnerability because they are 
</p>
<p>invisible within the State system. Other consequences include no or limited access to social, 
</p>
<p>health and educational services and increased vulnerability to statelessness or trafficking.  
</p>
<p>67. Lack of birth registration also compounds statistical gaps in relation to indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and their correlative invisibility within political and policy debates. 
</p>
<p><b>  Neo-liberal economic and development paradigms 
</b></p>
<p>68. Neo-liberalism is an economic paradigm that champions the power of market forces 
</p>
<p>and argues that, if left unregulated, markets will deliver global development. Neo-
</p>
<p>liberalism grew in dominance in the latter part of the twentieth century and infiltrated 
</p>
<p>development policy. The entry of foreign direct investments in indigenous territories to 
</p>
<p>exploit mineral resources and establish mega-infrastructure projects without the free, 
</p>
<p>informed and prior consent of the citizens impacted by market liberalization and 
</p>
<p>deregulation has led to systematic violations of indigenous land rights and self-
</p>
<p>determination. The global dominance of neo-liberalism has led to development that is 
</p>
<p>measured by overall growth figures, but which gives little weight to whether such 
</p>
<p>development leads to a reduction in inequality or poverty alleviation therefore significantly 
</p>
<p>disadvantaging vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples and women.  
</p>
<p>69. Another way in which neo-liberalism has affected indigenous peoples and women 
</p>
<p>are related to the structural adjustment policies of the International Monetary Fund and the 
</p>
<p>World Bank. Such policy interventions, which are based on neo-liberal doctrines, prescribe 
</p>
<p>harsh fiscal austerity programmes as a remedy for economic underdevelopment and a high 
</p>
<p>ratio of indebtedness in relation to gross domestic product. Dramatic decreases in 
</p>
<p>government spending routinely result in cuts to vital services, which disproportionally 
</p>
<p>impact the most vulnerable, including indigenous women.  
</p>
<p><b>  Issues of jurisdiction 
</b></p>
<p>70. There are often complex relationships between the customary jurisdictions of 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities and the national justice systems, which can have a number of 
</p>
<p>implications for women who are victims of violations of their human rights. Firstly, the 
</p>
<p>relationships can create confusion with regard to responsibility for incidences of violence </p>


<p>and discourage reporting by women. When women do come forward, there may be 
</p>
<p>complicated tensions between jurisdictions relating to competence to prosecute, which can 
</p>
<p>create delays and thereby prolong the suffering of the victim and discourage women from 
</p>
<p>reporting violence in the future. Loopholes in the rules governing the relationship between 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions can also make it possible for perpetrators to evade prosecution. 
</p>
<p><b>  Community dynamics and stigma 
</b></p>
<p>71. Indigenous systems of governance and power structures are often highly gendered 
</p>
<p>and may exclude women and their perspective from administration of justice and control 
</p>
<p>over the development of social standards and decisions, which impacts women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>vulnerability to abuses of their human rights. Indigenous communities tend to be tight-knit, 
</p>
<p>which can serve to protect perpetrators and silence women, and there is also often a high 
</p>
<p>level of stigma associated with being a victim of violence so that indigenous women are 
</p>
<p>often afraid to report violence for fear of being ostracized within the community. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the close-knit nature of indigenous communities and the social stigma of 
</p>
<p>violence may restrict women&#8217;s ability to seek justice within other jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Promising practices 
</b></p>
<p>72. Despite the significant constraints facing them, there are many instances where 
</p>
<p>indigenous women having successfully mobilized to fight for their rights. Those successes 
</p>
<p>have led to the development of promising practices in relation to the respect and protection 
</p>
<p>of indigenous women. The following examples of good practice are illustrative and not 
</p>
<p>exhaustive:  
</p>
<p> (a) As observed by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
</p>
<p>and consequences, the tribal justice system of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in the 
</p>
<p>United States has an effective infrastructure to provide safety of women within their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, including dedicated codes to address domestic violence and training for 
</p>
<p>personnel of tribal law enforcement authorities, tribal courts, prosecutors and probation 
</p>
<p>officers. Furthermore, tribal courts have ordered that offenders enrol in re-education 
</p>
<p>programmes and tribes support programmes to encourage boys and young men to respect 
</p>
<p>women;25 
</p>
<p> (b) Numerous tribes, such as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, maintain the 
</p>
<p>practice of banishing perpetrators of violence against women from their tribal jurisdictional 
</p>
<p>boundaries. That has proven to be an effective sanction which prevents women and their 
</p>
<p>children from being forced to flee their home due to violence. Banishment is a serious 
</p>
<p>community sanction that cuts off perpetrators and sends a strong message about the 
</p>
<p>protection of women and children in the community.26 Several Kankanaey Igorot 
</p>
<p>communities in the Cordillera region of the Philippines have customary laws that banish 
</p>
<p>members who have committed rape. Thus, in those communities, incidences of rape are 
</p>
<p>very low compared to urban areas and other provinces. The women of some Kalinga Igorot 
</p>
<p>villages in the same region have succeeded in convincing their traditional leaders to abolish 
</p>
<p>the discriminatory practices of bride price, dowry and arranged marriages;  
</p>
<p> (c) The Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law and in 
</p>
<p>Practice reported that some Latin American States formally recognize indigenous laws and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25  See A/HRC/17/26/Add.5, para. 100. 
</p>
<p> 26  Ibid., para. 102.  </p>


<p>courts in their constitutional laws, but that devolution of power was conditional on respect 
</p>
<p>for and enforcement of women&#8217;s rights by the indigenous legal system;27 
</p>
<p> (d) In Latin America, the use of quota systems to ensure the political 
</p>
<p>representation of women has had some success. Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Colombia, 
</p>
<p>Nicaragua, Panama and Peru, among others, have adopted electoral laws that include ethnic 
</p>
<p>and gender quotas aimed at increasing indigenous women&#8217;s participation in political 
</p>
<p>processes. For example, the Act on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men of Peru 
</p>
<p>specifically refers to the participation of indigenous women in public decision-making;28 
</p>
<p> (e) The Saskatchewan Provincial Court in Canada instituted a new court that 
</p>
<p>addresses a critical barrier to access to justice by conducting court proceedings in the Cree 
</p>
<p>language. The Cree Court takes into account traditional values when sentencing, 
</p>
<p>encourages the participation of community leaders and explicitly acknowledges the cultural 
</p>
<p>traditions of the First Nations. This innovative court structure reduces the negative impact 
</p>
<p>of barriers to access to justice while, at the same time, realizing indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
</p>
<p>to self-determination and equal participation in the justice system;29 
</p>
<p> (f) A number of agencies and mechanisms within the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p>including several special procedures mandates, treaty bodies and UN Women, have recently 
</p>
<p>dedicated attention and resources to the issue of indigenous people&#8217;s rights. For example, 
</p>
<p>UN Women has included the needs of indigenous women in their engagement with the 
</p>
<p>Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, mainstreamed women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>into the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and delivered a range of regional and 
</p>
<p>country level initiatives to indigenous women on economic empowerment, violence against 
</p>
<p>women, political participation and broader capacity-building;30 
</p>
<p> (g) Since the early 1990s, several networks of indigenous women have been 
</p>
<p>established in Australia, the Arctic, Latin America, North America, Africa and Asia, 
</p>
<p>including Enlace Continental de Mujeres Ind&#237;genas de las Am&#233;ricas, Asia Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Network, African Indigenous Women&#8217;s Organization, Sami Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Organization. These groups have impacted policy debates through the sharing of 
</p>
<p>experiences and joint advocacy on issues of concern. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Indigenous women and girls experience complex, multidimensional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mutu</b>ally reinforcing human rights violations. Abuses of indigenous women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>collective; economic, social and cultural; and civil and political rights are varied and 
</b></p>
<p><b>severe. Those violations are alarming infractions on their own, but constitute a form 
</b></p>
<p><b>of structural violence against indigenous women whereby they are victimized by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realities of the circumstances of their everyday life and routinely excluded from 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoying the rights and resources otherwise guaranteed to citizens. Indigenous women

<p><b>also suffer from other forms of violence, including traditional practices, sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, trafficking, domestic violence and gender-based killings.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Despite the severity and regularity of violations of the rights of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, the attention of much of the United Nations human rights and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy architecture has been limited. Gaps and weaknesses in analysis include a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>geographical balance, limited inclusion of collective rights, little exploration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersectionality in relation to the vulnerability of indigenous women and a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploration of the gender implications to rights issues affecting indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities. There are, however, promising signs that the gap in monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>indigenous women&#8217;s rights is<b> closing. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>To protect the rights of indigenous women, both a paradigm shift and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of a multidimensional approach is needed. States must find a way to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strike a delicate balance between protection of indigenous women and respect for  
</b></p>
<p><b>self-determination and autonomy of indigenous peoples. Engagement and consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b>with indigenous women and girls is central to finding that balance. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The United Nations system must support Member States in striking that 
</b></p>
<p><b>balance, as well as contribute to the paradigm shift needed through increasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the needs of indigenous women and reconceptualizing rights issues to 
</b></p>
<p><b>include the nexus between individual and collective rights, as well as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersectionality between different forms of inequality and discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to Member States  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, Member States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Improve access by indigenous peoples to education, with interventions 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted towards understanding and overcoming the specific barriers faced by girls;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Improve access by indigenous peoples, including women and girls, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>culturally sensitive health-care services; learn from and build on existing examples of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the good practices promoted by the United Nations Population Fund and the Pan 
</b></p>
<p><b>American Health Organization to develop an intercultural approach to health; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>support reinforcement of traditional healing and health practices of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples that have been proven to be effective;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Pay particular attention to providing a range of sexual and reproductive 
</b></p>
<p><b>health services to indigenous women and girls, with their free, prior and informed 
</b></p>
<p><b>consent;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Review and improve poverty-reduction programmes, such as conditional 
</b></p>
<p><b>cash transfers, to ensure cultural and gender sensitivity;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Invest in research that supports understanding of food insecurity among 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous communities and develop programmes to ensure the rights of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples to food;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Develop educational materials that sensitize non-indigenous populations 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the cultural realities of indigenous communities and women. Those materials 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be integrated into school curricula and in human rights training for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government officials providing services to indigenous peoples, including the police, 
</b></p>
<p><b>border guards and the judiciary, as well as health and education professionals.  </b></p>


<p><b>(g) When developing initiatives to improve the economic, social and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, pro-actively engage with indigenous women and girls and other members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous communities on how best to meet their needs; apply the principle of free, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prior and informed consent to the development of all laws, policies and programmes;   
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>With regard to civil and political rights, Member States should:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that the birth of every indigenous child is formally registered in 
</b></p>
<p><b>national systems;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop interventions to increase the number of indigenous women in 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and local political and public processes and explore the feasibility of 
</b></p>
<p>implementing quota systems for indigenous women&#8217;s representation in local and 
</p>
<p><b>national politics;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Explore ways to invest in the leadership capacity of indigenous women so 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they can play more active roles in indigenous decision-making structures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect women and girls within their communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure protection of the activities of all female human rights defenders;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Consider the development of the special tribunals to ensure access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice for indigenous women following abuses of their human rights. Such special 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions would allow for the individual needs of indigenous women to be met, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of focal points to establish effective links with indigenous justice systems, 
</b></p>
<p><b>greater recognition of specific cultural needs, as well as the accumulation of a systemic 
</b></p>
<p><b>view of rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Provide legal aid, interpretation and translation services, and culturally 
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitive information about their rights and available remedies to all indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and girls;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Within the context of the implementation of the Guiding Principles on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Business and Human Rights and the development of national action plans on human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and business, ensure that judicial mechanisms are the primary means by which 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporate violations of the rights of women and girls are remedied; and avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimizing voluntary, private forms of remedy that do not provide effective access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice for violations of the rights of women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure that due process is undertaken in relation to all indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>women who enter the criminal justice system;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)</b> <b>In relation to the overrepresentation of indigenous women in national 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal justice systems, invest in country-specific research into the root causes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop targeted prevention programmes based on such research; and, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible, consider alternatives to detention. When indigenous women are detained 
</b></p>
<p><b>they must still be afforded protection based on their human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>With regard to violence against indigenous women and girls, Member States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) As recommended by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
</b></p>
<p><b>its causes and consequences in her 2011 report (A/HRC/17/26), develop a holistic

</b></p>
<p><b>of violence against women, its causes and consequences, and addresses multiple and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersecting forms of discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In the context of affording indigenous people legal jurisdiction that is 
</b></p>
<p><b>compatible with their rights to self-determination, develop mechanisms that allow </b></p>


<p><b>indigenous women and girls to pursue other means of recourse against violence if they 
</b></p>
<p><b>are unable to obtain support and access to justice within indigenous communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Balance respect for the right to self-determination of indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities with their responsibility to protect indigenous women and girls in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity as national citizens and rights bearers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that all forms of violence against women, including female 
</b></p>
<p><b>genital mutilation and child marriage, are included as violations within criminal law;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure clarity with regard to the relationship between indigenous, 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and local jurisdictions in relation to violence against women; and ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the justice process is accessible and sensitive to the needs of indigenous women;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) In engagement with indigenous women and girls and building on existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practice, develop more comprehensive anti-violence and recovery programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>within indigenous communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Build the capacity of female indigenous leaders to advocate for the rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of women and girls to freedom from violence within indigenous communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Invest in research into the root causes of domestic violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in indigenous communities and design preventive and recovery programmes;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Refrain from any forms of violence against women, particularly in 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations of conflict, and prosecute all allegations of violence carried out by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government officials, such as border guards, the military and police.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>With regard to monitoring and accountability, Member States should:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consider developing national action plans </b>on indigenous women&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p><b>which are strongly linked with clear monitoring and accountability systems;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Invest in research and data collection systems to collect data 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated by gender, ethnicity or race, religion, language and territory or  
</b></p>
<p><b>geographical area. Such data collection and research should include information on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations, with particular focus on the situation of women and girls; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the targets and indicators agreed to monitor the sustainable 
</b></p>
<p><b>development goals include ways to measure and incentivize progress in relation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous communities and women in a meaningful way;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Work with the United Nations to ensure that a more consistent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>robu</b>st analysis of indigenous women&#8217;s rights is included in the monitoring of all 
</p>
<p><b>international human rights mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Monitor the full implementation of the recommendations made by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies, special procedures mechanisms and universal periodic review.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to United Nations organizations and mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the attention given to the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous peoples within the work of other United Nations mechanisms, more 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistent and geographically comprehensive analysis of the fulfilment of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights among indigenous women and girls is urgently needed. United Nations human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights mechanisms should direct additional attention to the nexus between individual 
</b></p>
<p><b>and collective rights and how that impacts indigenous women and girls, as well as how 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersecting forms of discrimination and vulnerability impact human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>In the context of this increasing attention to indigenous peoples, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur recommends that the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination </b></p>


<p><b>against Women develop a general comment on the rights on indigenous women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In addition, as invited to in the outcome document of the 2014 World 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conference on Indigenous Peoples, the Commission on the Status of Women should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider the issue of the empowerment of indigenous women at a session. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Human Rights Council should, as it was also invited to do in the outcome 
</b></p>
<p><b>document of the 2014 World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, consider examining 
</b></p>
<p><b>the causes and consequences of violence against indigenous women and girls, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation with the Special Rapporteur and other special procedures mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>United Nations organizations and mechanisms should:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure effective follow-up to all the relevant recommendations made by 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies, special procedures mechanisms and the universal periodic review;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Work with Member States to develop research into underdeveloped 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas which particularly impact the rights of indigenous women and girls. Research 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be developed on intersecting discrimination and vulnerability and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>relationship between individual and collective rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Recognize the agency of indigenous communities, women and girls as 
</b></p>
<p><b>development actors within the sustainable development goal for development 
</b></p>
<p><b>partnerships; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that the concerns of indigenous women and girls are included 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the post-2015 framework;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Work with indigenous women to strengthen analysis of both collective 
</b></p>
<p><b>and individual indigenous rights within the monitoring of the Beijing Platform of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Action.
