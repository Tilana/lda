MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
SECOND QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) of IAMGOLD Corporation
(“IAMGOLD” or the “Company”), dated August 3, 2016, is intended to supplement and
complement the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and notes
("consolidated interim financial statements") thereto as at and for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with IAMGOLD's audited annual
consolidated financial statements and related notes for December 31, 2015 and the related
MD&A included in the 2015 annual report. All figures in this MD&A are in U.S. dollars and tabular
dollar amounts are in millions, unless stated otherwise. Additional information on IAMGOLD can
be found at www.sedar.com or www.sec.gov.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
     
All information included in this MD&A, including any information as to the Company’s future
financial or operating performance, and other statements that express management’s
expectations or estimates of future performance, other than statements of historical fact, constitute
forward-looking information or forward-looking statements and are based on expectations,
estimates and projections as of the date of this MD&A. For example, forward-looking statements
contained in this MD&A are found under, but are not limited to being included under, the
headings “Second Quarter 2016 Summary”, “Second Quarter 2016 Outlook” and “Quarterly
Updates”, and include, without limitation, statements with respect to: the Company’s guidance for
production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, depreciation expense, effective tax rate,
capital expenditures, operations outlook, development and expansion projects, exploration, the
future price of gold, the estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources, the realization of
mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future
production, costs of production, permitting timelines, currency fluctuations, requirements for
additional capital, government regulation of mining operations, environmental risks,
unanticipated reclamation expenses, title disputes or claims and limitations on insurance
coverage. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information
about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future. Forward-looking
statements are generally identifiable by, but are not limited to, the use of the words “may”, “will”,
“should”, “continue”, “expect”, "budget", "forecast", “anticipate”, “estimate”, “believe”, “intend”,
“plan”, "wish", "schedule", “suggest”, “guidance”, “outlook”, “potential”, “prospects”, “seek”,
“targets”, “strategy” or “project” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words
or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of
estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently
subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. The
Company cautions the reader that reliance on such forward-looking statements involve risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual financial results, performance or
achievements of IAMGOLD to be materially different from the Company’s estimated future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements, and the
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. These risks, uncertainties
and other factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the global prices for gold, copper,
silver or certain other commodities (such as diesel and electricity); changes in U.S. dollar and
other currency exchange rates, interest rates or gold lease rates; risks arising from holding
derivative instruments; the level of liquidity and capital resources; access to capital markets, and
financing; mining tax regimes; ability to successfully integrate acquired assets; legislative,
political or economic developments in the jurisdictions in which the Company carries on
business; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities;
laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment; employee relations; availability
and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of
exploration and development, including the risks of diminishing quantities or grades of reserves;
adverse changes in the Company’s credit rating; contests over title to properties, particularly title
to undeveloped properties; and the risks involved in the exploration, development and mining
business. With respect to development projects, IAMGOLD’s ability to sustain or increase its
present levels of gold production is dependent in part on the success of its projects. Risks and
unknowns inherent in all projects include the inaccuracy of estimated reserves and resources,
metallurgical recoveries, capital and operating costs of such projects, and the future prices for the
relevant minerals. Development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates
of future cash flows. The capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other
projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction schedules can affect project
economics. Actual costs and economic returns may differ materially from IAMGOLD’s estimates
or IAMGOLD could fail to obtain the governmental approvals necessary for the operation of a
project; in either case, the project may not proceed, either on its original timing or at all.
For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks faced by the Company, and which may cause
the actual financial results, performance or achievements of IAMGOLD to be materially different
from the Company’s estimated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by forward-looking information or forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company’s
latest Annual Information Form (“AIF”), filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities at
www.sedar.com, and filed under Form 40-F with the United States Securities Exchange
Commission at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. The risks described in the AIF (filed and viewable on
www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml, and available upon request from the Company)
are hereby incorporated by reference into this MD&A.
The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required
by applicable law.

SECOND QUARTER 2016 SUMMARY
     
FINANCIAL
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $625.5 million at June 30, 2016, up $77.5
million from December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly due to proceeds from the sale of gold
bullion ($170.3 million), cash generated from operating activities ($122.6 million) and proceeds
from the issuance of flow-through shares ($30.3 million), partially offset by spending on Property,
plant and equipment and Exploration and evaluation assets ($149.4 million), repayment of the
credit facility ($70.0 million) and interest paid ($21.6 million).
Revenues from continuing operations for the second quarter 2016 were $232.5 million, up $6.0
million or 3% from the same prior year period due to a higher realized gold price ($13.9 million)
and higher sales volume at Essakane ($6.0 million), partially offset by lower sales volume at
Westwood ($12.3 million) and Rosebel ($2.2 million).
Cost of sales from continuing operations for the second quarter 2016 was $208.1 million, down
$20.7 million or 9% from the same prior year period. The decrease was the result of lower
operating costs ($17.3 million), lower depreciation expense ($4.1 million), partially offset by
higher royalties due to a higher realized gold price ($0.7 million). Operating costs were lower
primarily as a result of lower fuel prices, reduced mining at Westwood due to on-going focus on
underground development and remedial work related to the revised ramp-up, lower costs at
Rosebel as a result of the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, lower
labour costs at Rosebel following the workforce reductions in 2015, and productivity
improvement initiatives.
Depreciation expense for the second quarter 2016 was $62.3 million, down $4.1 million or 6%
from the same prior year period primarily due to lower amortization of capitalized waste stripping
at Essakane and lower carrying values at the Westwood mine, partially offset by lower reserves

•
•
•
•
at Rosebel.
Income tax expense from continuing operations for the second quarter 2016 was $14.0 million,
up $7.3 million or 109% from the same prior year period. Taxes were higher due to differences in
the level of taxable income in the Company’s operating jurisdictions from one period to the next
as well as re-measurements of deferred tax assets and liabilities as result of fluctuations in
foreign exchange.
Net loss from continuing operations attributable to equity holders for the second quarter 2016
was $12.2 million or $0.03 per share, down $7.5 million or $0.02 per share from the same prior
year period. The decrease was mainly due to lower cost of sales ($20.7 million) and higher
revenues ($6.0 million), partially offset by lower gains on derivatives and warrants ($7.4 million),
higher income tax expense ($7.3 million), higher foreign exchange losses ($3.3 million) and
higher other expenses ($2.3 million).
Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations1 for the second quarter 2016 was
$71.2 million, up $39.5 million or 125% from the same prior year period. The increase was
mainly due to a change in the movement of non-cash working capital ($20.2 million), higher
earnings after non-cash adjustments ($12.5 million) and lower net settlement of derivatives ($4.9
million).
Net cash from operating activities before changes in working capital from continuing operations1
for the second quarter 2016 was $64.9 million ($0.16 per share1), up $19.3 million ($0.05 per
share1) or 42% from the same prior year period.
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to equity holders1 for the second
quarter 2016 was $5.9 million ($0.01 per share1), up from an adjusted net loss of $30.8 million
($0.08 per share1) for the same prior year period.
OPERATIONS
Regarding health and safety, the frequency of all types of serious injuries (measured as the
DART rate2) for the second quarter 2016 was 0.23, an improvement over the Company's target
of 0.62 and 2015's performance of 0.67. The lower DART rate was largely attributable to the
strong health and safety performance across all sites.
Attributable gold production, inclusive of joint venture operations, for the second quarter 2016
was 197,000 ounces, down 5,000 ounces from the same prior year period. The decrease was
due to lower production at Westwood (7,000 ounces) offset by higher throughput at Rosebel
(2,000 ounces).
Attributable gold sales, inclusive of joint venture operations, for the second quarter of 2016 were
187,000 ounces, which was lower than production of 197,000 ounces due to timing of sales.

SECOND QUARTER MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – JUNE 30, 2016
PAGE 3
Total cash costs1 for the second quarter 2016 were $756 per ounce produced, down 7% from
the same prior year period. The decrease was mainly due to lower fuel prices, the stronger U.S.
dollar relative to the Euro and the Canadian dollar, the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar, lower labour costs at Rosebel following the workforce reductions in
2015, and productivity improvements partially offset by lower overall production. Included in
Total cash costs1 in the second quarter 2016 was a reduction of $23 per ounce produced
reflecting normalization of costs and the revised ramp-up at Westwood (June 30, 2015 - $27),
and a realized derivative gain of $2 per ounce (June 30, 2015 - realized derivative loss of $44)
per ounce produced.
All-in-sustaining costs1 for the second quarter 2016 were $1,114 per ounce sold, up $38 per
ounce from the same prior year period primarily due to an increase in sustaining capital and
lower sales, partially offset by lower cash costs. Included in All-in sustaining costs1 in the
second quarter 2016 was a reduction of $24 per ounce sold reflecting normalization of costs and
the revised ramp-up at Westwood (June 30, 2015 - $28), and a realized derivative gain of $2 per
ounce (June 30, 2015 - realized derivative loss of $53) per ounce sold.

MARKET TRENDS 
     
GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS
Gold increased more than 7% in the second quarter 2016 from its closing price in the previous
quarter and approximately 25% since the beginning of 2016. The rise in gold price can be
attributed to two key factors: the United Kingdom's June 23rd referendum in which the United
Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, and the shift in U.S. interest rate expectations. The
United Kingdom's referendum result to leave the European Union shocked capital markets and
investors. The U.S. Federal Reserve signaled an interest rate policy path that contradicted earlier
market expectations of rising rates. Both events amplified market volatility and uncertainty, which
benefited gold as investors sought less risky, safe-haven assets. Market events and conditions
will continue to have an impact on the Company’s revenues, operating costs, project
development expenditures and project planning.

This is a non-GAAP measure. Refer to the non-GAAP performance measures section of this

MD&A.
CURRENCY AND OIL PRICE
The U.S. dollar is the Company’s functional currency. The Company's revenue is denominated in
U.S. dollars as gold is priced in U.S. dollars. The Company’s main exposures are to the
Canadian dollar, the Euro, and oil prices, which have a direct impact on the Company’s
Canadian and international mining activities and operations.
Both the U.K. referendum vote outcome and the shift in U.S. interest rate expectations had an
impact on foreign currency and oil price movements. The Sterling Pound fell by 8% against the
U.S. dollar, while the Euro fell by less than 2% against the U.S. dollar, during the quarter. The
Canadian dollar remained mostly unchanged in the quarter as these events were off-set by the
impact of changes in oil prices. The average prices for Brent crude oil and West Texas
Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil were 34% and 35% higher, respectively, than the first quarter 2016.
In the second quarter 2016, the average exchange rates for the Canadian dollar and the Euro to
the U.S. dollar were C$1.2885 and $1.1292, respectively. The Company is forecasting
exposures of approximately C$149 million and €136 million for the remainder of 2016. These
exposures relate to operational and capital expenditures in Canada and West Africa. The
Company’s hedging strategy is designed to reduce the exchange rate volatility of these
currencies. Refer to Financial condition - Market risk section for more information.
In the second quarter 2016, the average prices of Brent and WTI crude oil were $47 and $46 per
barrel, respectively. The Company expects its fuel consumption for the remainder of 2016 to be
the equivalent of approximately 0.6 million barrels of oil for its mining operations in West Africa
and South America. The Company’s hedging strategy is to mitigate the price volatility of oil. Refer
to Financial condition - Market risk section for more information.

Attributable gold production for the second quarter 2016 of 89,000 ounces, was consistent with
the same prior year period due to an increase in throughput of harder rock and slightly higher
grades, offset by lower recoveries resulting from higher graphite content in the ore.
Total cash costs per ounce produced were $679 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $802
in the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized fuel prices, the
stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, and improved plant efficiency and performance, partially
offset by higher consumption of fuel. Essakane continues to explore initiatives including the
addition of a Solar Power Plant, to reduce fuel consumption in future years.
All-in sustaining costs per ounce sold during the second quarter 2016 were $1,090 compared to
$1,022 in the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sustaining capital
expenditures including an increase in capitalized waste stripping, partially offset by lower cash
costs.
During the second quarter 2016, sustaining capital expenditures of $31.8 million included
capitalized stripping costs of $11.9 million, mine equipment of $6.3 million, capital spares of $5.0
million, tailings construction of $2.7 million, mill equipment of $1.8 million, resource development

of $0.9 million, and various other sustaining capital expenditures of $3.2 million.
The site continues to make significant progress on enhancement and optimization initiatives to
improve recoveries, including installation of an intensive leach reactor and fine carbon treatment
system. Construction was completed during the second quarter 2016 with testing underway.
During the second quarter 2016, Essakane entered into a settlement agreement with the Ministry
of Environment of Burkina Faso to pay a fine of approximately twelve thousand U.S. dollars and
has retained an independent consultant to undertake an audit of their tailings storage facility. 
These measures resulted from non-compliant water samples taken late in 2015 at one of the
site’s water monitoring wells.
Outlook
The Company maintains the Essakane guidance. Essakane’s attributable production in 2016 is
expected to be between 365,000 and 375,000 ounces. Capital expenditures are expected to be
approximately $85 million, consisting entirely of sustaining capital.

Attributable gold production for the second quarter 2016 was 73,000 ounces compared to 71,000
ounces in the same prior year period. The 3% increase was primarily due to higher throughput,
partially offset by slightly lower grades. Despite experiencing a lower proportion of soft rock
compared to the same prior year period, mill throughput increased as a result of improvements
from the new flex power drive on the SAG mill.
Total cash costs per ounce produced were $765 in the second quarter 2016 compared to $864 in
the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower consumption of fuel, lower
fuel prices, and the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar against the U.S. dollar combined with
lower labour costs following the workforce reductions in 2015.
All-in sustaining costs per ounce sold during the second quarter 2016 were $1,051 compared to
$1,104 in the same prior year period primarily due to lower operating costs, partially offset by
higher sustaining capital expenditures.
During the second quarter 2016, sustaining capital expenditures of $18.4 million included mine
equipment of $5.7 million, capitalized waste stripping of $3.6 million, capital spares of $2.8
million, tailings storage facility construction of $2.3 million, and various other sustaining capital
expenditures of $4.0 million. Non-sustaining capital expenditures of $2.6 million were primarily
related to the secondary crusher.
To manage the challenges of increasing proportions of hard rock in the current year, Rosebel
continued with improvement initiatives to the grinding circuit during the second quarter 2016,
including introducing a modified liner design for the shell liners of the SAG mill to improve
grinding performance. In addition, Rosebel continues to make progress on securing other
sources of soft rock in and around its operations. The installation of a new secondary crusher is
also underway, which will assist in increasing the grinding capacity of hard rock in future years.
The on-going metallurgical improvements to elution, carbon management and gravity
optimization continue to help reduce gold inventory in circuit. The 2015 cost saving initiatives are
delivering significant sustainable benefits, especially increased loading and hauling efficiencies,
as well as improved drilling performance and explosives management, despite higher costs
relating to grade control.
Outlook
The Company maintains the Rosebel guidance. Rosebel’s attributable production in 2016 is
expected to be between 285,000 and 295,000 ounces. Capital expenditures are expected to be
approximately $65 million, comprised of $50 million of sustaining capital and $15 million of non-
sustaining capital.

Gold production for the second quarter 2016 was 16,000 ounces which was lower compared to
23,000 ounces in the same prior year period.
Underground development continued throughout the second quarter 2016 to open up access to
new mining areas with over 6,600 metres of lateral and vertical development. Development work
is on target with lateral development averaging 75 metres per day. The rehabilitation work related
to reopening the 104 mining block is progressing on schedule with the completion of three of five
by-pass drifts. In addition, production from the planned mining blocks is on schedule and
development of track drifts is ongoing and in accordance with the Company’s revised mine ramp-
up plan.
Total cash costs per ounce produced and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold for the second
quarter 2016 were $948 and $1,157, respectively, compared to $837 and $1,044 in the same
prior year period. In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the Company
reduced the costs attributed to inventory for the second quarter 2016 by $4.6 million to normalize
for the amount of fixed overhead on a per unit basis as a consequence of abnormally low
production. The Company adjusted total cash costs for the second quarter 2016 which were
reduced by $280 per ounce produced, and adjusted all-in sustaining costs which were reduced
by $283 per ounce sold.
During the second quarter 2016, sustaining capital expenditures of $3.2 million included
underground development of $1.4 million, underground equipment of $0.8 million, resource
development of $0.6 million, and mobile and other equipment of $0.4 million. Non-sustaining
capital expenditures of $23.6 million included expansion/ramp-up development of $22.2 million
and mobile equipment of $1.4 million.
The Company expects to continue normalizing total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs for
Westwood in 2016 on a similar basis as in 2015.
Outlook
The Company maintains the Westwood guidance. Westwood’s gold production in 2016 is
expected to be between 50,000 and 60,000 ounces. Capital expenditures are expected to be
approximately $80 million, consisting of $15 million in sustaining capital and $65 million in non-
sustaining capital.

Attributable gold production for the second quarter 2016 of 18,000 ounces, was consistent with
the same prior year period due to higher grades being offset by lower throughput and recoveries.
Despite lower fuel and consumables prices, lower contractor costs, favourable foreign exchange
rates and mill throughput improvements, total cash costs per ounce produced and all-in
sustaining costs per ounce sold for the second quarter 2016 were 43% and 38% higher
compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the drawdown of stockpiles in the
second quarter 2016.
The Company expects Sadiola to continue mining and milling oxides into early 2018. The
Company intends to move ahead with the Sadiola Sulphide Project by the end of the year
conditional upon the timely decision by its joint venture partner to proceed and the Government of
Mali’s renewal of construction and operating permits, the power agreement and fiscal terms
related to the project.
Mali - Yatela Mine (IAMGOLD interest - 40%)
The Yatela mine produced and sold 1,000 ounces in the second quarter 2016, compared to
2,000 ounces in the same prior year period. Stacking activity ceased in 2014 and closure
activities continue. Minor gold production continues from rinsing of the leach pads.
EXPLORATION
The Company was active at brownfield and greenfield exploration projects in eight countries
located in West Africa and the Americas.
In the second quarter 2016, expenditures for exploration and project studies totaled $9.9 million
compared to $13.6 million in the same prior year period, of which $8.0 million was expensed and
$1.9 million was capitalized. The decrease of $3.7 million reflects continued expenditure
reduction initiatives and re-prioritizing of planned expenditures compared to the prior year.
Drilling activities on active projects and mine sites totaled approximately 62,000 metres for the
second quarter 2016.

project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects and that the project may
proceed subject to the conditions listed in the assessment report and obtaining any required
approvals and permits. A provincial Environmental Assessment decision by the Ontario
government is expected by the end of the third quarter 2016.
Regional exploration activities continued within the 516 square kilometre property surrounding
the Côté Gold deposit to develop and assess exploration targets that could further maximize the
Company’s flexibility with respect to any future development decisions.
BROWNFIELD EXPLORATION PROJECTS
The Company's mine and regional exploration teams continued to conduct systematic brownfield
exploration and resource development work during the second quarter 2016 at the Essakane,
Rosebel and Westwood operations.
Essakane, Burkina Faso
Approximately 10,200 metres of reverse circulation drilling were completed on the mine lease
and surrounding concessions during the second quarter 2016. On the mine lease, drilling
focused on resource expansion in an area to the southeast of the Falagountou pit. The results
received to date are considered encouraging and will be incorporated into updated resource
models.
On the surrounding exploration concessions, exploration activities included the completion of
approximately 2,100 metres of reverse circulation drilling at the Tassiri and Gourara targets as
well as continued geological mapping, geochemical sampling and trenching to evaluate and
prioritize selected target areas. Results will be compiled and used to guide future drilling
programs.
Rosebel, Suriname
During the second quarter 2016, in excess of 7,500 metres of diamond drilling were completed
on the Rosebel mine lease and surrounding mineral concessions, including approximately 1,300
metres of exploration and 6,200 metres of resource development drilling. The program focused
on evaluating near-pit expansion targets at West Paycaro and will continue to evaluate other
near pit opportunities. Initial results are encouraging and will be used to guide future exploration
drilling programs and update resource models where applicable.
The near mine and regional exploration programs continue to focus on evaluating potential
resource expansions and exploration targets in the vicinity of existing operations and on the
Sarafina Option property to support the ongoing strategic objective to discover and outline
additional mineral resources within softer and near surface saprolite and transition rocks.
Westwood, Canada
During the second quarter 2016, underground excavation totaled approximately just over 19,700
metres of underground resource development diamond drilling and 770 metres of service drill
holes were completed. The diamond drill program continued to focus on infill drilling to upgrade
existing inferred mineral resources to the indicated mineral resource category and ongoing
definition drilling of ore zones scheduled to be mined in the near term.
GREENFIELD EXPLORATION PROJECTS
In addition to the mine site and brownfield exploration programs described above, the Company
conducted active exploration and drilling programs on a number of early to advanced stage
greenfield exploration projects during the second quarter 2016. Highlights include:

SECOND QUARTER MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – JUNE 30, 2016
PAGE 13
Boto, Senegal
Effective December 31, 2015, the Boto Gold project hosts an indicated resource of 27.7 million
tonnes averaging 1.8 g/t Au for 1.56 million ounces of gold and an inferred resource of 2.9 million
tonnes averaging 1.3 g/t Au for 125,000 ounces (see news release dated February 17, 2016).
During the second quarter 2016, the Company continued with various technical and
environmental studies to advance the economic evaluation of the project.
During the quarter, approximately 4,900 metres of diamond drilling were completed at the
Malikoundi deposit to target mineralization in the foot wall not completely drilled in previous
campaigns, as well as test for potential higher grade extensions at depth. Subsequent to the
quarter, initial assay results were reported (see news release dated July 5, 2016) which
confirmed high grade mineralization below the current resource pit shell as highlighted by drill
hole DBDD-2294 that intersected 84.0 metres grading 4.12 g/t Au, including 22.0 metres grading
11.25 g/t Au. Additional assay results are pending.
Pitangui, Brazil
Effective December 31, 2015, reported mineral resources at the São Sebastião deposit
comprised of an inferred resource of 4.3 million tonnes grading 5.0 g/t Au for 679,000 ounces of
gold (see news release dated February 17, 2016).
During the second quarter 2016, approximately 2,500 metres of diamond drilling were completed,
for a total of nearly 4,750 metres completed year to date, to test targets along strike to the
southeast of the São Sebastião deposit. To date, drilling has confirmed the presence of rock units
similar to those hosting the main São Sebastião deposit. This is a positive indicator and confirms
that the Company is exploring in a favourable sequence of rocks, which could potentially host
additional mineralization.
Siribaya Joint Venture, Mali
The Siribaya exploration project ("Siribaya project") in Mali is operated by IAMGOLD under a
50:50 joint venture with Merrex Gold Inc. ("Merrex"). Effective December 31, 2015, total resources
estimated for the Siribaya project include indicated resources of 2.1 million tonnes grading 1.90
g/t Au for 129,000 ounces of gold, and inferred resources of 19.8 million tonnes grading 1.71 g/t
Au for 1.1 million ounces. Of the inferred resources, the newly discovered Diakha deposit hosts
14.8 million tonnes grading 1.81 g/t Au for 863,000 ounces, accounting for 75% of the total
tonnage and 79% of the contained gold within the total inferred resources at Siribaya (see news
release dated February 9, 2016).
During the second quarter 2016, just over 10,800 metres of diamond and reverse circulation
drilling were completed to test the Diakha deposit at depth below the current resource pit shell,
as well as test for extensions along strike to the north. Subsequent to the reporting period, assay
results were reported from 41 reverse circulation drill holes totaling over 6,600 metres drilled to
evaluate the potential northern extension of the Diakha deposit. The results confirmed the
presence of mineralization in the northern extension area highlighted by drill hole SRC16-655
which intersected 70.0 metres grading 1.55 g/t Au, including 12.0 metres grading 2.79 g/t Au (see
Merrex news release dated July 6, 2016). Further assay results are pending and will be reported
as they are received, validated and compiled.
Monster Lake Joint Venture, Canada
The Monster Lake project, located 50 kilometres southwest of Chibougamau, Quebec, is held
under an earn-in option to joint venture agreement with TomaGold Corporation. The Company
holds an undivided 50% interest in the property, and holds an option to earn a further 25%
undivided interest, for a total 75% undivided interest in the project, should it spend a total of
C$10.0 million on the project within a seven year period, beginning January 1, 2015.
The winter drilling program ended in April with a total of just over 8,100 metres from 21 diamond
drill holes completed by the second quarter 2016. The program targeted the Monster Lake Shear
Zone (“MLSZ”) hosting the 325-Megane zone as well as adjacent structures identified from the
exploration program. Results reported during the quarter include: 1.2 metres grading 20.16 g/t Au
from drill hole ML 16-171; 0.7 metres grading 9.01 g/t Au and 5.5 metres grading 2.68 g/t Au from
drill hole ML 16-175, which appears to have intersected a second zone along the MLSZ structure
in an area located 200 to 400 metres to the north of the 325-Megane zone (see news release
dated June 15, 2016).
Exploration activities are ongoing and include geological and structural mapping, and selected
geochemical and geophysical surveys in advance of a follow up diamond drilling program
planned as weather conditions permit later in the year.
Nelligan Joint Venture, Canada
The Nelligan project is held under an earn-in option to joint venture agreement with Vanstar
Mining Resources Inc. (“Vanstar”), signed on November 12, 2014, whereby the Company may
earn up to an initial 50% interest in the property by completing staged cash payments totaling
C$0.6 million, and the completion of C$4.0 million in exploration expenditures over a period of
four and a half years. The Company can elect to earn an additional 25% to 30% undivided
interest by completing pre-feasibility and feasibility studies and making additional cash payment
totaling C$0.5 million.
During the second quarter 2016, assay results were reported from the 4,500 metre winter
diamond drilling program (see Vanstar news releases dated April 5 and June 30, 2016). The
results have confirmed the presence of several, new mineralized gold-bearing zones located
north of the Liam and Dan zones. Highlights include: 35.8 metres grading 1.90 g/t Au, including
18.0 metres grading 3.20 g/t Au in drill hole NE-16-36; 23.0 metres grading 1.23 g/t Au in drill
hole NE-16-37; and 10.3 meters grading 4.43 g/t Au and 27.3 meters grading 1.30 g/t Au from
drill hole NE-16-44.

The 2016 summer program has recently commenced and will involve completion of an
orientation soil sampling program and geological compilation and modelling of drill results to
guide preparation of further drilling campaigns.
Eastern Borosi Joint Venture, Nicaragua
The 176 square kilometre Eastern Borosi project is located in the Golden Triangle of Northeast
Nicaragua and is held under an earn-in option to joint venture agreement with Calibre Mining
Corporation (“Calibre”). The Company may earn up to a 70% interest in the project by completing
scheduled cash payments and exploration work expenditures totaling $10.9 million over six
years.
In the second quarter 2016, just over 3,600 metres of diamond drilling were completed, for a total
of approximately 4,300 metres year to date, to drill test selected gold-silver vein systems
highlighted from previous programs. Subsequent to the quarter, Calibre reported assay results
(see Calibre news release dated July 26th, 2016) which included 5.6 metres grading 11.13 g/t Au
and 13.7 g/t Ag, including 1.0 metre grading 56.96 g/t Au and 61.9 g/t Ag, from the Main Blag vein
system. Further assay results will be reported by the project operator as they are received,
validated and compiled.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
     
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At June 30, 2016, the Company had $625.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
During the first quarter 2016, the Company sold 135,148 ounces of gold bullion with a weighted
average acquisition cost of $721 per ounce for proceeds of $1,239 - $1,275 per ounce for a total
of $170.3 million.
In March 2016, the Company issued 12.0 million flow-through common shares for total proceeds
of $30.3 million. The flow-through common shares were issued to fund prescribed development
expenditures in the province of Quebec.
Working capital1 as of June 30, 2016 was $759.2 million, up $57.6 million compared to
December 31, 2015 due to lower current liabilities ($62.2 million) offset by lower current assets
($4.6 million).
Current assets as of June 30, 2016 were $947.3 million, down $4.6 million compared to
December 31, 2015 mainly due the sale of gold bullion ($97.4 million) and lower inventories
($7.9 million), partially offset by an increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash ($77.5
million) and higher receivables and other current assets ($23.4 million).

The credit facility provides for an interest rate margin above London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”), banker’s acceptance (“BA”) prime rate and base rate advances which varies
according to the total net debt ratio of the Company. Fees related to the credit facility vary
according to the total net debt ratio of the Company. This credit facility is secured by some of the
Company's real assets, guarantees by some of the Company’s subsidiaries and pledges of
shares in some of the Company's subsidiaries. The maturity date of this credit facility is February
1, 2020. The Company was in compliance with its credit facility covenants as at June 30, 2016.
Upon entering into the $250 million credit facility described above, the Company terminated its
four-year $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility. During the first quarter 2016 and prior to
termination, the Company repaid the $70.0 million outstanding at the end of fiscal 2015 on the
$500 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
The Company had a $75 million revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit which
matured on April 22, 2016. Following the expiration of the $75 million credit facility, letters of
credit worth $2.5 million were issued under the Company’s revolving credit facility and $0.5
million under a separate letter of credit. In lieu of a letter of credit previously committed for the
asset retirement obligation at the Doyon mine, the Company had committed restricted cash of
$71.3 million at June 30, 2016.
Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes previously issued by the Company​, if
the Company makes certain asset sales, it may use an amount equal to the net proceeds to
repay certain debt obligations and/or reinvest, or commit to reinvest, in the Company’s business,
within 365 days after the applicable asset sale. At the end of the 365-day period, if there remains
$50 million or more of the net proceeds that the Company has not used in this manner, the
Company would be required to use any such excess proceeds to offer to purchase the senior
unsecured notes at par in the manner described in the indenture. Regarding the use of proceeds
from the disposition of certain assets, the Company reports it has kept, observed, performed and
fulfilled its obligations under the indenture governing its previously-issued unsecured notes.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016 were $945.2 million, and comprise primarily of
contractual cash flows on senior unsecured notes, purchase obligations and capital expenditure
obligations. These obligations will be met through available cash resources and net cash from
operating activities.
The Company holds hedge derivative contracts that are included in the summary of outstanding
derivative contracts in the Financial condition - Market risk section.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Investments in marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The Company early adopted
IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, as amended November 2013 ("IFRS 9 (2013)") effective April
2014 and all previously recognized impairments were reclassified to Other comprehensive
income ("OCI") as an adjustment to opening components of equity as at January 1, 2014.
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES
Associates (INV Metals Inc. and Merrex Gold Inc.) and Joint Ventures (Sadiola and Yatela) are
included in the Consolidated balance sheets as Investments in associates and joint ventures.
The Company’s share of earnings (loss) from associates and joint ventures is included in the
Consolidated statements of earnings as Share of net earnings (loss) from investments in
associates and joint ventures, net of income taxes.
During the second quarter 2016, the Company reviewed its investments in associates for
objective evidence of impairment and determined that no impairment existed. For investments in
joint ventures, if the Company is made aware of significant events or transactions which were not
reflected in the Company’s share of net earnings (loss) from its joint ventures, adjustments would
be made to the consolidated financial statements.
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. For hedging activities, it is the risk that the fair value of a
derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices or currency
exchange rates and that this in turn affects the Company’s financial condition. The Company
mitigates market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters which limit the types and degree
of market risk which may be undertaken, and establishing trading agreements with counterparties
under which there is no requirement to post any collateral or make any margin calls on
derivatives. Counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the
fair value of a derivative.
CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK
The Company’s objective is to hedge a portion of its exposure to Canadian dollars and Euros
resulting from operating and capital expenditure requirements at Essakane, Rosebel, Westwood
and the Corporate offices.
OIL CONTRACTS AND FUEL MARKET PRICE RISK
Diesel is a key input to extract tonnage, and in some cases, to wholly or partially power
operations. Since diesel is produced by the refinement of crude oil, changes in the price of oil
directly impact diesel costs. The Company believes there is a strong relationship between prices
for crude oil and diesel.

Hedge ratio is calculated by dividing the amount (in foreign currency or commodity units) of
1 
outstanding derivative contracts by total foreign currency and commodity exposures,
respectively.
The Company sold put options and purchased call options with strike prices which fall within
the given range. If crude oil market prices are below the put strike price (low end of range) in
2016, the Company will incur a loss from the margin between the lower market price and the set
2 
put strike price. If crude oil prices are greater than the call strike price (high end of range) in
2016, the Company will benefit from the margin between the higher market price and the set
call strike price.
The Company will purchase crude oil in 2017 and 2018 at spot prices below $60/barrel. The
3 
Company purchased call options to protect against an increase in crude oil prices above
$60/barrel.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
Net cash used in investing activities for the second quarter 2016 was $87.1 million, up $31.4
million from the same prior year period. The increase was mainly due to higher spending on
Property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets including capitalized
borrowing costs ($28.1 million) and higher funding of restricted cash ($2.2 million).
FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Net cash used in financing activities for the second quarter 2016 was $16.2 million, down $7.6
million from the same prior year period. The decrease was mainly due to lower interest paid ($2.5
million), lower dividends paid to minority interests ($1.7 million) and lower repayment of finance
lease obligations ($1.5 million).
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On January 22, 2015, the Company completed the sale of Niobec. The Company received
$504.1 million in cash, including working capital adjustments. The sale of Niobec included an
adjacent rare earth element ("REE") deposit of which a 2% royalty on gross proceeds will be
payable to the Company on any REE production.

CRITICAL JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
     
 
The Company’s management makes judgments in its process of applying the Company’s
accounting policies in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the
preparation of financial data requires that the Company’s management make assumptions and
estimates of effects of uncertain future events on the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets
and liabilities at the end of the reporting period and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates as the
estimation process is inherently uncertain. Estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis based
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the
circumstances. Revisions to estimates and the resulting effects on the carrying amounts of the
Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for prospectively.
The critical judgments, estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of the Company's
consolidated financial statements are reflected in note 3 of the Company's audited annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Qualified Person and Technical information
The technical and scientific information relating to exploration activities disclosed in this
document was prepared under the supervision of and verified and reviewed by Craig
MacDougall, P.Geo., Senior Vice President, Exploration, IAMGOLD.  Mr. MacDougall is a
Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.
Data verification involves data input and review by senior project geologists at site, scheduled
weekly and monthly reporting to senior exploration management and the completion of project
site visits by senior exploration management to review the status of ongoing project activities and
data underlying reported results. All drilling results for exploration projects or supporting resource
and reserve estimates referenced in this MD&A have been  previously reported in news releases
disclosures either by the Company or the project operator as the case may be (see references
news releases), and have been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101
Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The sampling and assay data from drilling
programs are monitored through the implementation of a quality assurance - quality control (QA-
QC) program designed to follow industry best practice. Drill core (HQ and NQ size) samples are
selected by the project geologists and sawn in half with a diamond saw at the project site. Half of
the core is typically retained at the site for reference purposes. Generally, sample intervals are
 1.0 to 1.5 metre in length and RC holes are sampled at 1.0 metre intervals at the drill rig.
Samples are prepared and analyzed at site for the Company's producing mines and at accredited

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
     
 
For a discussion of new accounting standards issued but not yet effective that may impact the
Company, refer to note 3 of the Company’s consolidated interim financial statements.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
     
 
The Company is subject to various business, financial and operational risks which could
materially adversely affect the Company’s future business, operations and financial condition
and could cause such future business, operations and financial condition to differ materially from
the forward-looking statements and information contained in this MD&A and as described in the
Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information found in this document.
IAMGOLD’s vision challenges it to generate superior value for its stakeholders through
accountable mining. The Company’s business activities expose it to significant risks due to the
nature of mining, exploration and development activities. The ability to manage these risks is a
key component of the Company’s business strategy and is supported by a risk management
culture and an effective enterprise risk management (“ERM”) approach.
These practices ensure management is forward looking in its assessment of risks. Identification
of key risks occurs in the course of business activities, while pursuing business approved
strategies and as part of the execution of risk oversight responsibilities at the Management and
Board level.
The Company’s view of risks is not static. An important component of its ERM approach is to
ensure key risks which are evolving or emerging are appropriately identified, managed, and
incorporated into existing ERM assessment, measurement, monitoring and reporting processes.
For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks faced by the Company, refer to the Company’s
latest AIF, filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities at www.sedar.com, and filed
under Form 40-F with the United States Securities Exchange Commission at
www.sec.gov/edgar.html. The AIF, which is filed and viewable on www.sedar.com and
www.sec.gov/edgar.html, is available upon request from the Company, and is incorporated by
reference into this MD&A.

The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial performance measures in its MD&A, which are
described in the following section.
EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS
This measure is intended to enable management to better understand the earnings generated by
operating mine sites before adjustments for corporate costs and non-operating charges and
income. This measure is the difference between IFRS reported revenues and cost of sales,
which include revenues from all gold and royalties, direct costs, production related allocated
costs and depreciation.

GOLD MARGIN
The Company’s MD&A refers to gold margin per ounce, a non-GAAP performance measure, in
order to provide investors with information about the measure used by management to monitor
the performance of its gold assets. The information allows management to assess how well the
gold mines are performing, relative to the plan and to prior periods, as well as assess the overall
effectiveness and efficiency of gold operations.
In periods of volatile gold prices, profitability changes with altering cut-off gold grades. Such a
decision to alter the cut-off gold grade will typically result in a change to total cash costs per
ounce, but it is equally important to recognize gold margins also change at a similar rate. While
mining lower-grade ore results in less gold being processed in any given period, over the long-
run it allows the Company to optimize the production of profitable gold, thereby maximizing the
Company’s total financial returns over the life of the mine. IAMGOLD’s exploitation strategy,
including managing cut-off grades, mine sequencing, and stockpiling practices, is designed to
maximize the total value of the asset going forward. At the same time, the site operating teams
seek to achieve the best performance in terms of cost per tonne mined, cost per tonne processed
and overheads.
The gold margin per ounce does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, is
unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be
considered in isolation or a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

This measure is intended to enable management to understand the average realized price of
gold sold to third parties in each reporting period after removing the impact of non-gold revenues
and by-product credits.
The average realized gold price per ounce sold does not have any standardized meaning
prescribed by IFRS, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers,
and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for measures of performance prepared
in accordance with IFRS.

ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS
Adjusted net earnings (loss) attributable to equity holders of IAMGOLD and adjusted net earnings
(loss) attributable to equity holders of IAMGOLD per share are non-GAAP performance
measures. Management believes these measures better reflect the Company’s performance for
the current period and are better indications of its expected performance in future periods.
Adjusted net earnings (loss) attributable to equity holders of IAMGOLD and adjusted net earnings
(loss) attributable to equity holders of IAMGOLD per share are intended to provide additional
information, but are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.
These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and should not be
considered in isolation or a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with
IFRS. Adjusted net earnings (loss) attributable to equity holders of IAMGOLD represents net
earnings (loss) attributable to equity holders excluding certain impacts, net of taxes, such as
write-down of assets, gain or loss on sales of assets, unrealized non-hedge derivative gain or
loss, interest expense which is unrelated to financing working capital, foreign exchange gain or
loss, restructuring charges, and changes in estimates of asset retirement obligations at closed
sites. These measures are not necessarily indicative of net earnings or cash flows as determined
under IFRS.

TOTAL CASH COSTS PER OUNCE PRODUCED
The Company’s MD&A refers to total cash costs per ounce produced, a non-GAAP performance
measure, in order to provide investors with information about a key measure used by
management to monitor performance. This information is used to assess how well the producing
gold mines are performing compared to plan and prior periods, and also to assess their overall
effectiveness and efficiency.
Total cash costs are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the Gold Institute,
which was a worldwide association of gold and gold product suppliers, including leading North
American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, the standard is still an
accepted measure of reporting cash costs of gold production in North America. Adoption of the
standard is voluntary, the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies. Costs include mine site operating costs such as
mining, processing, administration, royalties, production taxes, and realized hedge and non-
hedge derivative gains or losses, exclusive of depreciation, reclamation, capital expenditures
and exploration and evaluation costs. These costs are then divided by the Company’s
attributable ounces of gold produced by mine sites in commercial production to arrive at the total
cash costs per ounce produced.
The measure, along with revenues, is considered to be one of the key indicators of a Company’s
ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. These total cash
costs do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and differ from measures
determined in accordance with IFRS. They are intended to provide additional information and
should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in
accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily indicative of net earnings or cash
flow from operating activities as determined under IFRS.

mines to cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense as per the consolidated interim financial

NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS
The Company makes reference to a non-GAAP performance measure for net cash from
operating activities from continuing operations. Management believes by measuring cash flows
generated from continuing operations, this non-GAAP measure provides investors with a better
understanding of the cash flows of the underlying business activities.

The Company makes reference to a non-GAAP performance measure for net cash from
operating activities before changes in working capital from continuing operations and net cash
from operating activities before changes in working capital from continuing operations per share.
Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors including a build-up or reduction of
inventories. Management believes by excluding these items, these non-GAAP measures provide
investors with the ability to better evaluate the cash flow performance of the Company.

ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS PER OUNCE SOLD
The Company believes, although relevant, the current total cash costs measure commonly used
in the gold industry does not capture the sustaining expenditures incurred in producing gold,
therefore, may not present a complete picture of a Company’s operating performance or its ability
to generate free cash flow from its current operations. For these reasons, members of the World
Gold Council (“WGC”) defined an all-in sustaining costs measure which better represents the
costs associated with producing gold. The WGC is a non-profit association of the world's
leading gold mining companies, established in 1987 to promote the use of gold.
The all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) per ounce sold measure better meets the needs of analysts,
investors and other stakeholders of the Company in assessing its operating performance and its
ability to generate free cash flow. The definition of AISC, on an attributable basis, commences
with cost of sales, excluding depreciation expense, and includes sustaining capital expenditures,
sustaining exploration and evaluation expenses, environmental rehabilitation accretion and
depreciation, by-product credits, corporate general and administrative costs.
This measure seeks to represent the cost of selling gold from current operations, and therefore
does not include capital expenditures attributable to development projects or mine expansions,
greenfield exploration expenses, income tax payments, working capital defined as current assets
less current liabilities (except for inventory adjustments), items needed to normalize earnings,
interest costs or dividend payments.

PAGE 24
Consequently, this measure is not representative of all of the Company’s cash expenditures and
is not indicative of the Company’s overall profitability. The calculation of AISC per ounce sold is
based on the Company’s attributable interest in sales from its gold mines. The usage of an
attributable interest presentation is a fairer and more accurate way to measure economic
performance than using a consolidated basis. The Company reports the AISC per ounce sold
measure on an attributable sales basis, compared with the Company’s current total cash costs
presentation, which is on an attributable production basis.
The Company reports the measure with and without a deduction for by-product credits and
reports the measure for its owner-operator mines (includes Essakane, Rosebel, Westwood), and
in total (includes owner-operator mines and Joint Ventures).
AISC measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and differs from
measures determined in accordance with IFRS. It is intended to provide additional information
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance
prepared in accordance with IFRS. This measure is not necessarily indicative of net earnings or
cash flow from operating activities as determined under IFRS.
