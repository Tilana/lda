<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants conducted a visit to Italy 
</p>
<p>from 2 to 6 December 2014. He visited Rome and held consultations with government 
</p>
<p>officials, civil society organizations and agencies of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>Despite a challenging economic and political climate, Italy has taken bold initiatives 
</p>
<p>to address the unprecedented number of migrants and asylum seekers arriving by boat. The 
</p>
<p>European Union member States must collectively support front-line States such as Italy in 
</p>
<p>order to provide a sustainable response that ensures full respect for the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 2 to 6 December 2014, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants conducted an official follow-up visit to Italy. The visit was undertaken in follow-
</p>
<p>up to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2012 year-long study on the management of the external 
</p>
<p>borders of the European Union (A/HRC/23/46), which included a mission to Italy (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 and Corr.1).  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur reaffirmed the importance of addressing irregular border 
</p>
<p>crossings, recalling that it is in the context of such crossings that the most egregious human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses appear to take place (see A/HRC/23/46, para. 20). The increased numbers of 
</p>
<p>migrant crossings and deaths in the Mediterranean Sea and the response by European 
</p>
<p>Union member States prompted him to revisit the issue of European Union border 
</p>
<p>management. In addition, in September 2014 the Human Rights Council, through 
</p>
<p>presidential statement 27/3, requested the Special Rapporteur, among others, to pay 
</p>
<p>particular attention to the protection of migrants at sea. Consequently, the present report is 
</p>
<p>focused on external border control, and does not provide a comprehensive overview of the 
</p>
<p>broader human rights situation of all migrants in Italy. The report should be read in 
</p>
<p>conjunction with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2012 report on his mission to Italy 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 and Corr.1) and with his 2014 reports on Malta 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/36/Add.3) and the European Union (A/HRC/29/36). 
</p>
<p>3. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Rome and met with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Italian Coast Guard, the Authority for 
</p>
<p>Children and Adolescents and the National Office against Racial Discrimination and with 
</p>
<p>members of the Senate Commission for Human Rights. He also met with representatives of 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the 
</p>
<p>International Organization for Migration. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also consulted with numerous civil society organizations, 
</p>
<p>lawyers and academics working in the field of migration. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere appreciation to the Government of 
</p>
<p>Italy for its support throughout the visit and to UNHCR for its excellent support and 
</p>
<p>assistance in preparing and carrying out the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background on Italy and migration: a brief overview 
</b></p>
<p>6. In 2014, an unprecedented number of migrants and asylum seekers arrived in the 
</p>
<p>Euro-Mediterranean region. Given its long coastline and its proximity to North Africa, Italy 
</p>
<p>continues to be a key point of entry for many migrants seeking to reach Europe. 
</p>
<p>7. Migrants take flight owing to the push factors in their countries of origin, which may 
</p>
<p>include war, conflict, natural disasters, persecution or extreme poverty, as well as in 
</p>
<p>response to pull factors, such as unmet needs in the labour markets of European Union 
</p>
<p>member States. Migrants are often willing to do the &#8220;dirty, difficult and dangerous&#8221; jobs 
</p>
<p>that nationals will not, at the exploitative wages that unscrupulous employers offer, 
</p>
<p>including in the construction, agriculture, hospitality and caregiving sectors.  
</p>
<p>8. According to UNHCR, more than 200,000 refugees and migrants reached Europe by 
</p>
<p>crossing the Mediterranean by sea in 2014, compared to 60,000 in 2013. Italy received over 
</p>
<p>140,000 arrivals in 2014, most of whom were rescued at sea by the Italian navy operation 
</p>
<p>Mare Nostrum. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>9. UNHCR estimates that over 3,500 people died or went missing at sea in 2014, in 
</p>
<p>comparison to just over 600 in 2013. Most boats carrying irregular migrants to Europe sail 
</p>
<p>from Libya, others leave from Tunisia or Egypt. The Mediterranean has been recognized by 
</p>
<p>UNHCR as a mixed migration channel, used both by economic migrants and by those 
</p>
<p>seeking international protection. A significant proportion of those currently using this 
</p>
<p>precarious route are Eritreans and Syrians seeking asylum. 
</p>
<p>10. In 2014, the number of Eritreans and Syrians arriving by sea to Italy increased by 
</p>
<p>almost 400 per cent and 600 per cent, respectively, compared to 2013. More women, 
</p>
<p>children and elderly persons are embarking on such journeys, adding to the already large 
</p>
<p>proportion of vulnerable people aboard unsafe boats. In 2014, over 18,000 children arrived 
</p>
<p>in Malta and Italy by sea, including at least 10,000 unaccompanied minors, mainly boys 
</p>
<p>between the ages of 12 and 16. Many of the migrants who arrive are under the age of 30. 
</p>
<p>11. Irregular migrants who have been rescued have reported that they were abused and 
</p>
<p>exploited at each stage of their migration towards Italy and the European Union. Before 
</p>
<p>departure, migrants can often spend several days or weeks detained by smugglers, without 
</p>
<p>information and in constant fear of being deceived and abused. During sea crossings, they 
</p>
<p>end up in unseaworthy and overcrowded boats, typically made of rubber or wood, packed 
</p>
<p>into a few metres of space with no food or water. Life vests cost extra, and most migrants 
</p>
<p>do not get one. The journey can take one to four days, or even longer, depending on the 
</p>
<p>weather, the sea conditions and the condition of the boat. In several incidents people have 
</p>
<p>been stranded on boats for more than two weeks before being rescued. Many arrivals are 
</p>
<p>diagnosed with trauma and report being victims of or witnesses to physical and sexual 
</p>
<p>violence, in some cases perpetrated by smugglers.  
</p>
<p>12. This sudden and growing surge in demand for Mediterranean Sea crossings has 
</p>
<p>resulted in a deterioration of the already precarious conditions of the journey and an 
</p>
<p>increase in smuggling, as ruthless groups charge migrants thousands of euros to facilitate 
</p>
<p>dangerous routes into the European Union. 
</p>
<p>13. For many who arrive, especially Syrians and Eritreans, Italy is considered a country 
</p>
<p>of transit. From their port of arrival in Italy, migrants most often make their way to Milan 
</p>
<p>and then onwards to countries such as Austria, Germany and Sweden. Onward movement 
</p>
<p>and asylum claims tend to vary among migrants of different nationalities. Syrians who 
</p>
<p>arrive in Italy are reportedly able to leave reception centres within 48 hours. Such reception 
</p>
<p>centres are open facilities that allow migrants freedom of movement. Eritreans are not 
</p>
<p>usually as well connected as Syrians and do not have as many resources, and therefore wait 
</p>
<p>longer to leave Italy, sometimes for six weeks or more, if they leave at all. Some Eritreans 
</p>
<p>and other non-Syrian migrants prefer to apply for asylum in Italy because it offers better 
</p>
<p>opportunities for protection than they would find in other parts of Europe. The rate of 
</p>
<p>positive decisions in refugee status and subsidiary protection determination cases is 32 per 
</p>
<p>cent in Italy, higher than the rates in several other European Union countries. 
</p>
<p>14. The Italian Coast Guard predicts an increase in the numbers of migrants arriving in 
</p>
<p>2015. This is not only because war, conflict and extreme poverty continue to push people to 
</p>
<p>seek safety in Europe, but also because, with asylum seekers paying huge sums to cross the 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean by boat, there is a powerful incentive for smugglers to continue to increase 
</p>
<p>their activities. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework on migration 
and</b> <b>border management 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the present section, the Special Rapporteur will discuss only the legal framework 
</p>
<p>developed since his previous country visit to Italy. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> A. Regional framework  
</b></p>
<p>16. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Freedoms, which was adopted in 1950 by the Council of Europe and entered into force in 
</p>
<p>1953, contains substantive rights that reflect, to a large extent, the rights enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Convention is complemented by 
</p>
<p>14 additional protocols which have introduced substantive human rights guarantees. The 
</p>
<p>European Court of Human Rights upholds the Convention. Regarding forced or collective 
</p>
<p>expulsions of migrants and asylum seekers, the Court has handed down judgements in the 
</p>
<p>following cases involving Italy. 
</p>
<p>17. On 23 February 2012, the Court made a landmark decision in <i>Jamaa and Others </i>v. </p>
<p><i>Italy</i>, holding unanimously that Italy had violated the Convention when it forcibly returned 
</p>
<p>a group of asylum seekers by sea to Libya, where they were at risk of violations of their 
</p>
<p>human rights and in danger of being repatriated to their home countries. According to the 
</p>
<p>Court&#8217;s judgement, even when individuals are intercepted in international waters 
</p>
<p>Government authorities are obliged to abide by international human rights law. They must 
</p>
<p>offer each person they intercept an individual procedure and the means to challenge a 
</p>
<p>decision to return them to their country of departure.  
</p>
<p>18. On 21 October 2014, in <i>Sharifi and Others </i>v.<i> Italy and Greece</i>, the Court confirmed 
</p>
<p>its position concerning collective expulsion by Italian authorities. It reiterated the 
</p>
<p>importance of ensuring that all migrants had access to the asylum procedure, so as to 
</p>
<p>prevent forced returns to countries where migrants might be subject to inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>19. In several cases, the Court found that asylum seekers who were returned to Italy 
</p>
<p>under the Dublin regulations would not be subject to ill-treatment.
1
 However, on November 
</p>
<p>2014, in <i>Tarakhel </i>v.<i> Switzerland</i>, the Court ruled that there would be a violation of article 3 
</p>
<p>of the Convention if the applicants were to be returned to Italy without the Swiss authorities 
</p>
<p>having first obtained individual guarantees from the Italian authorities that the applicants 
</p>
<p>would be taken charge of in a manner adapted to the age of the children and that the family 
</p>
<p>would be kept together.  
</p>
<p>20. In the <i>Sharifi</i> case, the Court clarified its position, stating that the Dublin system, 
</p>
<p>which is used to determine which European Union member State is responsible for 
</p>
<p>examining an asylum application lodged in one of the member States by a third-country 
</p>
<p>national, must be applied in a manner compatible with the European Convention on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. The Court clarified that no form of collective and indiscriminate returns could be 
</p>
<p>justified by reference to the Dublin system, and it was for the State carrying out the return 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the destination country offered sufficient guarantees in the application of its 
</p>
<p>asylum policy to prevent the person concerned from being removed to her country of origin 
</p>
<p>without an assessment of the risks faced. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these rulings made by the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and urges Italy and other European countries to fully implement them in law 
</p>
<p>and in practice.

</b></p>
<p><b> B. National legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>22. In this section, the Special Rapporteur will touch only upon legislation introduced 
</p>
<p>following his country visit to Italy in 2012. Since then, there has been a significant degree 
</p>
<p>of legal reform in relation to the human rights of migrants within Italy, as outlined below.  
</p>
<p>23. Legislative Decree No. 109 of 16 July 2012, on implementing Directive 2009/52/EC 
</p>
<p>of the European Parliament and of the Council, introduced sanctions and measures against 
</p>
<p>employers of illegally staying third-country nationals and, by modifying article 22 of the 
</p>
<p>Immigration Act, introduced a protection mechanism for irregular migrants who decide to 
</p>
<p>report their situation of exploitation to the police.  
</p>
<p>24. Legislative decree No. 119 of 15 October 2013 introduced article 18 bis in the 
</p>
<p>Immigration Act, adding the possibility for migrant women subject to psychological and 
</p>
<p>physical violence (especially within the family) to report their case to the police and obtain 
</p>
<p>a residence permit for humanitarian reasons.  
</p>
<p>25. Decree-Law No. 146/2013 of 23 December 2013, which was converted to Law 
</p>
<p>No. 10/2014 on 21 February 2014, was introduced to help with the identification of migrant 
</p>
<p>prisoners to avoid further administrative detention once their prison term had been served. 
</p>
<p>26. Legislative Decree No. 18/2014 of 21 February 2014, which transposes into national 
</p>
<p>law European Union Directive 2011/95/EU, sets standards for the qualification of third-
</p>
<p>country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a 
</p>
<p>uniform status for refugees or persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content 
</p>
<p>of the protection granted. Beneficiaries of subsidiary protection now enjoy the same rights 
</p>
<p>afforded to refugees, in particular with regard to family reunification and to the period of 
</p>
<p>validity of their residence permits, which was increased from three years to five years. The 
</p>
<p>legislative decree also introduced the National Integration Plan for the beneficiaries of 
</p>
<p>international protection. 
</p>
<p>27. Law No. 67/2014 of 28 April 2014 mandated the government to abolish the criminal 
</p>
<p>offence of irregular entry or stay in Italian territory within 18 months and to, in its place, 
</p>
<p>establish administrative sanctions. Irregular migrants re-entering the country following an 
</p>
<p>expulsion will continue to face criminal sanctions. The Special Rapporteur notes the 
</p>
<p>decriminalization of irregular migration as a positive step, but remains concerned that the 
</p>
<p>law has yet to be effectively implemented. 
</p>
<p>28. Law No. 190/2014 of 1 January 2015 provides for the transfer of resources for 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied minors from the Ministry of Labour to the Ministry of the Interior and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a new fund for the reception of all unaccompanied minors with an annual 
</p>
<p>budget allocation of &#8364;32.5 million per year. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Italy and the European Union: regional influence on national laws, 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies and institutions in the sphere of migration management  
</b></p>
<p><b>and border control 
</b></p>
<p>29. Since its implementation of the Schengen acquis in 1998, Italy continues to be a key 
</p>
<p>point of entry into the Schengen area, and its coastline is one of the major external sea 
</p>
<p>borders of the European Union. As a border State within the Schengen area, Italy is in a 
</p>
<p>difficult position: it is responsible for the European Union border at a time of significant 
</p>
<p>peaks in irregular migration and with very limited support from the European Union and 
</p>
<p>other European Union member States (see A/HRC/23/46/Add.3 and Corr.1 for more 
</p>
<p>details).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur observes that, under the Schengen system, any irregular 
</p>
<p>migrant who is registered in Italy will be returned to Italy, even if they move to another 
</p>
<p>country within the European Union. This can create a situation where irregular and 
</p>
<p>undocumented migrants become stuck in Italy; in particular those without documents often 
</p>
<p>become trapped, as they are unable to travel to other countries within the European Union 
</p>
<p>or safely return home. 
</p>
<p>31. Following heavy criticism of the Dublin II regulation, including the greater pressure 
</p>
<p>it puts on front-line European Union member States, Regulation No. 604/2013 of the 
</p>
<p>European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union (the Dublin III regulation) 
</p>
<p>came into force on 1 January 2014. It provides enhanced safeguards for applicants for 
</p>
<p>international protection in Europe, including a provision that stipulates that, while waiting 
</p>
<p>for a decision on his or her appeal, a person has the right to remain in the country (a 
</p>
<p>suspensive right of appeal), and a clause designed to prevent breaches of human rights, 
</p>
<p>whereby a State is not permitted to transfer a person to another European Union member 
</p>
<p>State if there is a risk that he or she would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>in that member State. This means that States will be obliged to undertake their own 
</p>
<p>assessment of the situation rather than continue to apply the Dublin regulations on returning 
</p>
<p>migrants unless the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court of Justice take 
</p>
<p>a decision to the contrary. 
</p>
<p>32. The Dublin III regulation introduces an early warning mechanism, which is aimed at 
</p>
<p>making it easier to detect problems in a member State&#8217;s asylum system so that the 
</p>
<p>European Union Commission and the European Asylum Support Office can provide 
</p>
<p>assistance before the situation degenerates. The regulation contains an emphasis on respect 
</p>
<p>for family life, including provisions to ensure that transfers under Dublin III facilitate 
</p>
<p>family unity as much as possible. It also widens the definition of the family to benefit 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied minors, who can now be reunited with grandparents, uncles or aunts living 
</p>
<p>in a European Union member State. Additionally, during personal interviews, officials are 
</p>
<p>required to inform applicants that they may provide information about family members in 
</p>
<p>other European Union member States, which will be taken into account in the 
</p>
<p>determination as to which State is responsible. The Dublin III regulation also provides for 
</p>
<p>the production of a common information leaflet on Dublin and a specific leaflet for 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied minors. 
</p>
<p>33. A key area of concern is that, under Regulation No. 603/2013 of the European 
</p>
<p>Union, migrants entering the European Union are fingerprinted to ensure that their asylum 
</p>
<p>claim is processed in the correct member State in accordance with the Dublin system. If 
</p>
<p>migrants attempt to enter another European Union member State, they are returned to 
</p>
<p>where it has been deemed their application should be made &#8212; usually the first country of 
</p>
<p>entry. Migrants often do not want to have their fingerprints taken because, as discussed 
</p>
<p>above, they have plans to travel to other countries in Europe.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this requirement creates tension between 
</p>
<p>irregular migrants and border officials in the context of arrivals in Italy. In September 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Department of Public Security of the Ministry of the Interior issued a circular 
</p>
<p>containing operational guidelines for police on identification procedures for migrants, 
</p>
<p>explicitly authorizing police officers to use force in cases where migrants do not cooperate 
</p>
<p>and refuse either to provide personal details or to have their fingerprints taken. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur expressed his concern about the use of these guidelines for purposes related to 
</p>
<p>the Dublin system, especially as the limits on the use of force are unclear. Border guards 
</p>
<p>face particular difficulty in fingerprinting large groups of migrants who refuse to have such 
</p>
<p>data collected. The Special Rapporteur received information about the use of excessive 
</p>
<p>force for identification purposes, which included the use of physical violence and tasers. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>also received information about ill-treatment of irregular migrants who had just arrived in 
</p>
<p>Italy.  
</p>
<p>35. Another issue of concern to the Special Rapporteur is the observation that the Dublin 
</p>
<p>system continues to create a situation where persons who may have a valid asylum claim 
</p>
<p>avoid lodging that claim in Italy because they believe they will not receive adequate 
</p>
<p>protection or opportunities there. Many asylum seekers in Italy are unable to gain assistance 
</p>
<p>for integration or find a job, due to the economic crisis, and do not receive social benefits, 
</p>
<p>which makes them vulnerable to becoming homeless. The number of those arriving in Italy 
</p>
<p>is far higher than the number of those who remain, showing that Italy is reachable but is not 
</p>
<p>the country of destination for most migrants. This demonstrates that the Dublin system 
</p>
<p>exacerbates vulnerabilities by creating a situation in which persons with valid asylum 
</p>
<p>claims choose not to lodge their claim, but rather continue their journey as undocumented 
</p>
<p>migrants, thus remaining at a high risk of abuse and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the lack of trust in the capacity of 
</p>
<p>the Dublin system. Irregular migrants appear to distrust Dublin procedures, such as those 
</p>
<p>for family reunification. Those processes often take months, whereas a smuggler can 
</p>
<p>reunite migrants with their family within days. The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
</p>
<p>the Italian office dealing with cases that fall under the Dublin regulations was understaffed 
</p>
<p>and required more resources in order to make the most of the improvements of the Dublin 
</p>
<p>system.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur cautions that migrants must see the benefits of following the 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Dublin system, including identification and fingerprinting, or they will 
</p>
<p>continue to try to evade such procedures and find alternative means to reach and travel 
</p>
<p>through Europe. In the view of many migrants, the foreseeable consequence of respecting 
</p>
<p>the Dublin procedures is that they will be kept on, or returned to, Italian territory and 
</p>
<p>prevented from reaching their intended country of destination.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Border management 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur observed that the Lampedusa tragedy of October 2013 and 
</p>
<p>the increased numbers of irregular migrants arriving in Italy by boat had shifted the focus 
</p>
<p>of the country&#8217;s migration policies from a reliance on securing its borders to a response that 
</p>
<p>emphasizes humanitarian assistance and more recognition of the human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rescue at sea  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Italian Coast Guard 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the safety of migrants travelling 
</p>
<p>towards Italy still remains the key priority of both the Italian Coast Guard and the Financial 
</p>
<p>Guard in migration-related operations at sea. 
</p>
<p>40. As discussed above, the majority of the boats carrying migrants to Italy depart from 
</p>
<p>Libya, and safety conditions aboard the boats are extremely poor. Often, one of the 
</p>
<p>migrants on a boat is given a satellite phone by smugglers with the instructions to call the 
</p>
<p>Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre after six or seven hours at sea. Callers 
</p>
<p>normally report that there are women and children on board, that the boat is sinking, that 
</p>
<p>they have no food, and/or that they are dying. The Italian Coast Guard sometimes receives 
</p>
<p>over 25 calls simultaneously with the same detailed request, and it is difficult to determine 
</p>
<p>which boat to prioritize in its search and rescue operations. The Coast Guard has also 
</p>
<p>reported incidents where migrants had refused assistance offered by Malta, as they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>preferred Italy. Italian search and rescue vessels are well equipped, with a medical team to 
</p>
<p>offer emergency care, food, water and blankets. Once migrants reach land, their well-being 
</p>
<p>is the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior. 
</p>
<p>41. The Coast Guard has been monitoring an area of approximately 500,000 square 
</p>
<p>kilometres. Officials informed the Special Rapporteur that 90 per cent of the search and 
</p>
<p>rescue operations were conducted outside of the Italian search and rescue area. Libya does 
</p>
<p>not have search and rescue capacity and Malta and Greece have limited capacity. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, Italy is coordinating such operations for the entire Mediterranean. Although 
</p>
<p>they have expressed their commitment to their rescue work, Coast Guard officers also have 
</p>
<p>capacity limitations. Given the sheer numbers of arrivals, the Coast Guard confirmed the 
</p>
<p>need for a more concerted effort to require the European Union and the broader 
</p>
<p>international community to save lives. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Mare Nostrum 
</b></p>
<p>42. In October 2013, following two major shipwrecks in which 500 people died off the 
</p>
<p>Italian coast and criticism that disputes between Italy and Malta had led to delays in rescue 
</p>
<p>response time, Italy launched a naval search and rescue operation entitled Mare Nostrum. 
</p>
<p>Its goal was to prevent further tragedies at sea and apprehend smugglers. The Italian navy 
</p>
<p>employed an average of five of its ships and their air units in search and rescue operations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur noted the extraordinary efforts made under Mare Nostrum, 
</p>
<p>which resulted in over 150,000 persons being rescued. Italy had to devote 9 million euros 
</p>
<p>monthly to this operation, at a time of high unemployment and economic crisis. Its repeated 
</p>
<p>requests for financial, technical and human support from the European Union and other 
</p>
<p>European Union member States were rejected and met with criticism.  
</p>
<p>44. Unable to sustain its bold operation, Italy officially ended Mare Nostrum in 
</p>
<p>November 2014. However, its navy has continued to save lives at sea and has cooperated 
</p>
<p>with Operation Triton, managed by the European Agency for the Management of 
</p>
<p>Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European 
</p>
<p>Union (FRONTEX), as discussed below. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Merchant vessels  
</b></p>
<p>45. Private vessels cooperate in and sometimes carry out search and rescue operations at 
</p>
<p>the request of the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre. In 2014, 660 merchant 
</p>
<p>vessels were involved in such operations; however, such assistance is provided at their own 
</p>
<p>financial cost. The crews on the merchant vessels provide migrants with whatever 
</p>
<p>emergency support they are able to offer until the migrants are disembarked at an Italian 
</p>
<p>port. The Special Rapporteur noted that in February 2015 the International Organization for 
</p>
<p>Migration had underlined that support provided by merchant vessels to search and rescue 
</p>
<p>operations should remain exceptional, and that States should shoulder the main 
</p>
<p>responsibility of fielding sufficient search and rescue capacity. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation on border management 
</b></p>
<p>46. The management of the external borders of Italy is further supported by FRONTEX, 
</p>
<p>which works with the Guardia di Finanza and the border police to combat irregular 
</p>
<p>migration, migrant smuggling and other migration-related offences. The FRONTEX joint 
</p>
<p>operations Hermes 2014 and Aeneas 2014 were established at the request of the 
</p>
<p>Government of Italy. Under Hermes, air surveillance was provided to detect migrant flows 
</p>
<p>from Tunisia towards the south of Italy, whereas under Aeneas, flows from Egypt, Greece 
</p>
<p>and Turkey towards Apulia and Calabria were monitored.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>47. In April 2014, Regulation No. 656/2014 of the European Parliament and of the 
</p>
<p>Council on surveillance of the external sea borders in the context of operational cooperation 
</p>
<p>coordinated by FRONTEX was adopted, aimed at resolving confusion arising from 
</p>
<p>diverging national interpretations of international provisions on maritime surveillance. The 
</p>
<p>Regulation sets out clear rules for FRONTEX joint operations at sea, including with respect 
</p>
<p>to the interception of vessels, search and rescue situations and the disembarkation of 
</p>
<p>intercepted or rescued people; operational plans are to be established in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>provisions of the regulation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Joint Operation Triton 
</b></p>
<p>48. In November 2014, the joint operations Hermes 2014 and Aeneas 2014 were 
</p>
<p>combined to form Joint Operation Triton. The operational area and necessary assets were 
</p>
<p>agreed between FRONTEX and Italy, as the host State, on the basis of the requests for 
</p>
<p>assistance made by the Italian authorities. The operation relies primarily on the human and 
</p>
<p>technical resources made available by Italy.  
</p>
<p>49. Triton supports the Italian efforts &#8212; it does not replace or substitute Italian 
</p>
<p>obligations in monitoring and surveying the Schengen external borders and in guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>full respect of European Union and international obligations, including those relating to 
</p>
<p>search and rescue operations. Italy will have to continue to make substantial efforts using 
</p>
<p>national means, in full coordination with the FRONTEX operation, to manage its external 
</p>
<p>borders. 
</p>
<p>50. The forces deployed as part of Joint Operation Triton respond to distress calls and 
</p>
<p>have conducted search and rescue operations. However, they have limited reach outside 
</p>
<p>Italian territorial waters and are not as well equipped as those under Mare Nostrum were, 
</p>
<p>and will therefore not have the same impact. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Bilateral agreements 
</b></p>
<p>51. Italy has a number of bilateral agreements in place with countries of transit and 
</p>
<p>origin. The refoulement of asylum seekers in the Hirsi case, discussed above, took place 
</p>
<p>under the auspices of a bilateral agreement with Libya. The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
</p>
<p>his concerns about bilateral agreements being used as a means of border control, often 
</p>
<p>without sufficient human rights safeguards. He remains concerned about the lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency surrounding such agreements: not only are negotiations conducted seemingly 
</p>
<p>with very little external oversight or input, but often the final text is not publicly available, 
</p>
<p>thus contributing to uncertainty regarding the content, interpretation and implementation of 
</p>
<p>the agreements. 
</p>
<p>52. Of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur is the information he received about 
</p>
<p>continued violations of the principle of non-refoulement and of the prohibition of collective 
</p>
<p>expulsions with regard to the return of some migrants, possibly including minors, 
</p>
<p>immediately after their arrival. He learned that, on the basis of bilateral readmission 
</p>
<p>agreements, nationals of Egypt and Tunisia are often returned without having had access to 
</p>
<p>asylum procedures; this has occurred in, among other places, Pozzallo. In addition, push-
</p>
<p>backs to Greece reportedly continue to occur in some locations, for example Fiumicino 
</p>
<p>Airport in Rome; children are sometimes involved.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Regional processes 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur learned of the involvement of Italy in the Khartoum and 
</p>
<p>Rabat regional processes, which are aimed at ensuring more effective border control, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>tackling smuggling and trafficking and addressing the root causes of migration, such as 
</p>
<p>economic development and human rights issues in countries of origin. They are also 
</p>
<p>exploring a common approach to enable those seeking asylum to do so closer to their 
</p>
<p>countries of origin. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur remains cautious about such processes, as they are 
</p>
<p>perceived mainly as enablers of migration control mechanisms aimed at preventing 
</p>
<p>migrants from crossing the Mediterranean and reaching European Union territory, 
</p>
<p>regardless of the consequences in terms of human rights violations. This approach leads to 
</p>
<p>practices that drive migrants further underground, thus empowering and entrenching 
</p>
<p>smuggling rings, increasing the precariousness of migrants and exposing migrants to more 
</p>
<p>exploitation and human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>55. However, if conceived as part of a long-term plan to support development assistance 
</p>
<p>cooperation with, and the political stabilization of, the countries of origin and transit, such 
</p>
<p>processes could be useful. Clear objectives, transparency and accountability will be needed 
</p>
<p>to inspire trust that these mechanisms have the human rights of migrants at heart.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Detention and reception of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Detention practices and legislation 
</b></p>
<p>56. All irregular migrants who arrived in 2013 and 2014 were channelled into the Italian 
</p>
<p>asylum system, which is focused more on reception rather than detention. This government 
</p>
<p>decision seriously affected the Italian reception system, which did not have the capacity to 
</p>
<p>host the increasingly large number of irregular migrants arriving by sea. The Government 
</p>
<p>consequently established the following policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>57. In 2012, the Ministry of the Interior established a national working group to 
</p>
<p>coordinate the progressive expansion of the centres under the System for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Asylum Seekers and Refugees (SPRAR), with a view to accommodating asylum seekers in 
</p>
<p>small centres for shorter periods of time instead of keeping them in the large, often 
</p>
<p>overcrowded reception centres for asylum seekers (CARAs). The working group was set up 
</p>
<p>in response to the increase in the number of migrants arriving as a result of the Arab Spring.  
</p>
<p>58. Legislative Decree No. 18/2014 confirmed the mandate of the working group, which 
</p>
<p>includes activities aimed at improving the national reception system and establishing an 
</p>
<p>integration plan for the beneficiaries of international protection. The working group 
</p>
<p>includes representatives of UNHCR and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>59. In recognition of the rise in numbers of irregular arrivals by sea, in 2013 the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior issued decrees in which it envisioned increasing the capacity of 
</p>
<p>SPRAR centres to 20,000 places between 2014 and 2016. As at February 2015 the system&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>capacity had grown to 20,956 places. 
</p>
<p>60. Decree-Law No. 119/2014 sets out new procedures for gaining access to 
</p>
<p>international protection. Among other things, the law increased from 10 to 20 the number 
</p>
<p>of territorial commissions tasked with analysing asylum claims,
2
 and provided for the 
</p>
<p>possibility of establishing up to 30 additional commissions. To date there are 40 
</p>
<p>commissions. Additionally, the Decree-Law allows the Ministry of the Interior to take 
</p>
<p>exceptional measures to simplify the procedure applied by the commissions should the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Commissions are composed of two officials from the Ministry of the Interior, one representative of 
</p>
<p>the local authorities and one representative of UNHCR. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>number of claims increase considerably; establish new standards for the composition and 
</p>
<p>the competence of the commissions; increase the budget allocated to the reception of 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers and migrants arriving by sea; and provide for tax reductions for local 
</p>
<p>authorities involved in providing assistance for asylum seekers and migrants arriving by 
</p>
<p>sea.  
</p>
<p>61. Law No. 161/2014 reduced the maximum time limit for detention of irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants in identification and expulsion centres from 18 months to a strict limit of 
</p>
<p>3 months. The new maximum is reduced to 30 days if the irregular migrant has already 
</p>
<p>spent 3 months or more in prison. In his previous report the Special Rapporteur had 
</p>
<p>criticized the country&#8217;s practice of lengthy detention and consequently welcomes this 
</p>
<p>reform. Such developments help to protect the human rights of migrants in Italy. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Types of accommodation 
</b></p>
<p>62. The reception system for irregular migrants and asylum seekers is complex and 
</p>
<p>includes a number of different structures. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. First reception centres 
</b></p>
<p>63. First accommodation centres accommodate large numbers of irregular migrants and 
</p>
<p>generally offer basic assistance, including food, accommodation, clothing, some 
</p>
<p>information, legal services, first aid and emergency treatment. Upon arrival, irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants may be placed temporarily in reception centres for migrants (CDAs),3 which 
</p>
<p>provide short-term accommodation, or in first assistance and reception centres (CSPAs),4 
</p>
<p>depending on what is locally available. Currently 10 CDAs and 4 CPSAs are operating. In 
</p>
<p>April 2014, in response to the increase in arrivals, centres for extraordinary reception were 
</p>
<p>established as open centres that host people for up to six months. Those who arrive by sea 
</p>
<p>are taken first to CPSAs and then to either a centre for extraordinary reception or a CARA. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reception centres for asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>64. CARAs are longer-term accommodation facilities for asylum seekers. Article 20 of 
</p>
<p>Legislative Decree No. 25/2008 stipulates that asylum seekers should be accommodated in 
</p>
<p>CARAs for identification reasons. However, in practice, many are placed in such centres 
</p>
<p>owing to a lack of places in other centres. 
</p>
<p>65. SPRAR centres also offer longer term accommodation. Such centres, which were 
</p>
<p>established in 2002, are managed by local authorities through the National Association of 
</p>
<p>Italian Municipalities and in cooperation with NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 
</p>
<p>are funded by the Ministry of the Interior. They offer several services aimed at integrating 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers and refugees into Italian society. Unlike the other types of reception centre, 
</p>
<p>which host significant numbers of migrants at any one time, SPRAR centres are small to 
</p>
<p>medium size, better tailored to individual needs and better equipped to assist in local 
</p>
<p>integration. There are currently 456 such centres. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Accommodation for Dublin returnees 
</b></p>
<p>66. Temporary reception centres have been established to host migrants transferred to 
</p>
<p>Italy on the basis of the Dublin regulations. Under those systems accommodation is 
</p>
<p>provided until the migrant&#8217;s legal situation is defined; if a migrant belongs to a vulnerable 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 This type of centre was created in 1995. 
</p>
<p> 4 This type of centre was created in 2006. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>category, an alternative facility is found. The Ministry of the Interior, through the European 
</p>
<p>Refugee Fund, has financed these temporary reception facilities. Currently 13 centres for 
</p>
<p>the reception of Dublin returnees are operating; of those, 7 are designated for vulnerable 
</p>
<p>persons. There are four centres in Rome, three in the province of Milan, two in Venice, two 
</p>
<p>in Bologna and two in Bari; all together they can accommodate a total of 572 Dublin 
</p>
<p>returnees.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to reception centres 
</b></p>
<p>67. In accordance with Legislative Decree No. 140/2005 of 30 May 2005, asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers who lack the financial resources to ensure an adequate standard of living for 
</p>
<p>themselves and their family, in terms of health and subsistence, can present a reception 
</p>
<p>request when lodging their asylum claim. To do so, an asylum seeker must fill in an ad hoc 
</p>
<p>declaration of destitution when filing the asylum application at the immigration office of 
</p>
<p>the police (Questura). 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur noted that the Legislative Decree did not provide a 
</p>
<p>definition of &#8220;adequate standard of living and subsistence&#8221; and did not envisage specific 
</p>
<p>financial support for different categories of migrants according to identified vulnerability, 
</p>
<p>such as people with special needs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Challenges to gaining access to reception centres 
</b></p>
<p>69. Irregular migrants and asylum seekers face a number of challenges in gaining access 
</p>
<p>to reception centres in Italy.  
</p>
<p>70. First, relevant law stipulates that access to reception centres is to be provided from 
</p>
<p>the moment of the presentation of the asylum request and the fingerprinting. In practice, 
</p>
<p>however, asylum seekers may gain access to accommodation centres only after formal 
</p>
<p>registration. The waiting times between the fingerprinting and registration differ among the 
</p>
<p>police immigration offices. Depending on, among other things, the number of asylum 
</p>
<p>applications, the waiting period can be several months. Consequently, asylum seekers must 
</p>
<p>find alternative temporary accommodation and, if they lack economic resources, must 
</p>
<p>either resort to friends, find emergency facilities or sleep on the streets. 
</p>
<p>71. Second, there are capacity issues. Given the surge in the numbers of asylum seekers, 
</p>
<p>the Italian reception system does not have sufficient capacity to provide adequate reception 
</p>
<p>services in all cases. In addition, owing to a shortage of Prefecture (local government 
</p>
<p>office) staff and of cultural mediators and interpreters, not all accommodation requests can 
</p>
<p>be assessed and processed in a timely manner. Reception requests are transmitted by the 
</p>
<p>Questura to the Prefecture, which checks the availability of places in SPRAR centres and 
</p>
<p>CARAs. If those are full, the Prefecture is obligated by law to grant a financial allowance 
</p>
<p>until accommodation is located. In practice, it will still send asylum seekers to one of the 
</p>
<p>reception centres, resulting in overcrowding and a deterioration of living conditions. A 
</p>
<p>partial response to the limitations in capacity is the enlargement of the network of SPRAR 
</p>
<p>centres, as mentioned above. 
</p>
<p>72. A related obstacle is the length of the asylum procedure, including the appeal phase, 
</p>
<p>which leads to asylum seekers staying for long periods in CARAs and SPRAR centres, thus 
</p>
<p>creating difficulties in guaranteeing that places will be made available for new asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers.  
</p>
<p>73. Lastly, there can also be confusion among migrants and asylum seekers as to how to 
</p>
<p>access accommodation. In large cities, such as Rome, there is a lack of information on how 
</p>
<p>to submit to the Questura a request for accommodation.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>74. These barriers can have serious consequences in relation to the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants. Asylum seekers who have neither access to reception centres nor a financial 
</p>
<p>allowance are obliged to live in the self-organized settlements that have flourished in 
</p>
<p>metropolitan areas. These settlements are usually overcrowded and have terrible living 
</p>
<p>conditions. One example is Salam Palace, an abandoned university building in a southern 
</p>
<p>suburb of Rome, occupied by about 800 irregular migrants from the Horn of Africa. These 
</p>
<p>settlements, and other precarious forms of accommodation, including living on the street, 
</p>
<p>impede the enjoyment by migrants and asylum seekers of their economic and social rights, 
</p>
<p>as well as their integration into society.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Conditions of reception centres 
</b></p>
<p>75. The issue of inadequate living conditions of asylum seekers in Italy has been gaining 
</p>
<p>more attention from other European Union member States, owing to the rising number of 
</p>
<p>appeals filed before the European Court of Human Rights by asylum seekers against their 
</p>
<p>transfer to Italy on the basis of the Dublin regulation (see, for example, the case of <i>Tarakhel 
</i></p>
<p>v.<i> Switzerland</i>).  
</p>
<p>76. Owing to the limited duration of the follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>unable to visit detention and reception centres. However, he received, from various 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, the information below describing the services and conditions of those 
</p>
<p>facilities. Reception conditions vary to a significant degree among different types of 
</p>
<p>accommodation and also within the same type of accommodation. Therefore it is difficult 
</p>
<p>to gain a full picture of and reliable information for each reception centre. 
</p>
<p>77. CARAs do not all offer the same reception services. The quality of assistance varies 
</p>
<p>between facilities, and sometimes fails to meet adequate standards. Areas of concern 
</p>
<p>include the provision of legal and psychosocial assistance; inadequate identification, 
</p>
<p>referral and care provided to vulnerable individuals owing to low levels of coordination 
</p>
<p>among stakeholders; lack of capacity for necessary logistical follow-up; and unsystematic 
</p>
<p>monitoring of reception conditions by the relevant authorities, resulting in complaints not 
</p>
<p>being unaddressed.  
</p>
<p>78. CARAs are reportedly often overcrowded; accordingly, the quality of the 
</p>
<p>accommodation services offered is not equivalent to those of the SPRAR centres or other 
</p>
<p>reception facilities of a smaller size, and can be highly variable among CARAS themselves. 
</p>
<p>Depending on the CARA, and to differing extents, overcrowding can exacerbate problems 
</p>
<p>relating to insufficient food; a lack of sufficient sanitation facilities; limited space available 
</p>
<p>for assistance, legal advice and socialization; the physical inadequacy of the facilities; the 
</p>
<p>remoteness of the centres and their isolation from the community; and difficulties in 
</p>
<p>gaining access to appropriate information. 
</p>
<p>79. In order to ensure the proper monitoring of reception facilities, the Senate 
</p>
<p>Commission for Human Rights issued a resolution in March 2014 asking the Government 
</p>
<p>to review the mechanisms for the outsourcing of the management of all identification and 
</p>
<p>expulsion centres.
5
 The Commission recommended that a single public entity be appointed 
</p>
<p>for the management of all centres at the national level.6 In addition, on 17 November 2014 
</p>
<p>the Chamber of Deputies established an inquiry commission to monitor and assess CARAs 
</p>
<p>and CDAs and the detention conditions of migrants held in identification and expulsion 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>centres, as well as to investigate the outsourcing mechanisms for the management of the 
</p>
<p>centres, which often lack transparency. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts to 
</p>
<p>standardize and improve reception centre conditions, it is important that Italy ensures the 
</p>
<p>full and effective implementation of those changes.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Length of stay in reception centres 
</b></p>
<p>80. The maximum stay in a CARA is 35 days, or 20 days for asylum seekers without 
</p>
<p>travel or identity documents and those who had false or counterfeited documents. However, 
</p>
<p>the actual stay has been systematically extended to six months or more, since the asylum 
</p>
<p>procedure takes several months and the asylum seeker has the right to stay in the centre 
</p>
<p>during the appeal stage. 
</p>
<p>81. Depending on the availability of places, the urgency of the case and the vulnerability 
</p>
<p>of the person, asylum seekers can also be referred to SPRAR centres, where typically they 
</p>
<p>stay for up to 12 months.  
</p>
<p>82. A number of provisions govern access to SPRAR centres by migrants who exercise 
</p>
<p>their right to work within Italy. If a decision on the asylum request is not adopted within 
</p>
<p>six months after the submission of the request, the asylum seeker receives a new six-month 
</p>
<p>residence permit allowing him to work until the asylum procedure is completed. Asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers who work may continue to benefit from SPRAR accommodation provided that they 
</p>
<p>contribute financially. Those who lodge an appeal against a negative decision on their 
</p>
<p>asylum application are allowed to remain on the national territory and have access to 
</p>
<p>accommodation in a SPRAR centre only if they are not allowed to work or their physical 
</p>
<p>condition prevents them from working. 
</p>
<p>83. As mentioned earlier, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the new law that limits 
</p>
<p>detention to a period of 90 days and looks forward to its successful implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Revocation of the provision of accommodation in reception centres 
</b></p>
<p>84. In accordance with Legislative Decree No. 140/2005, the Prefect of the province 
</p>
<p>where the accommodation centre is placed can decide on an individual basis to revoke the 
</p>
<p>provision of accommodation to a migrant on a number of grounds, including failure to 
</p>
<p>notify the Prefecture before leaving a centre, the lodging of a previous asylum claim in Italy 
</p>
<p>and a serious violation of a centre&#8217;s internal rules. 
</p>
<p>85. By law, asylum seekers may, with the benefit of free legal aid, lodge an appeal 
</p>
<p>before the Administrative Regional Tribunal against the decision of the Prefect to 
</p>
<p>discontinue the provision of accommodation in a centre. In practice, appeals are rarely 
</p>
<p>lodged, because asylum seekers who do not present themselves at the centres or leave the 
</p>
<p>centres after their arrival have usually left to enter another European Union member State.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Access to reception centres by third parties 
</b></p>
<p>86. Lawyers, international organizations, the asylum seeker&#8217;s family members, Italian 
</p>
<p>citizens and NGOs need prior permission from the Prefecture to enter CARAs; this is not 
</p>
<p>required for SPRAR centres. The Special Rapporteur urges that access to all reception 
</p>
<p>centres be facilitated for all stakeholders. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>87. Italian legislation does not establish specific limits on the freedom of movement of 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers. Nevertheless, it does allow the competent Prefect to delimit a specific 
</p>
<p>place of residence or a geographic area where asylum seekers may circulate freely. 
</p>
<p>88. To the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s knowledge, this provision has never been applied. The 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement of migrants can, however, be affected by the fact that it is not 
</p>
<p>possible to leave the reception centre temporarily, for example to visit relatives, without 
</p>
<p>prior authorization. If a person leaves a centre without permission or does not return within 
</p>
<p>the period of time agreed upon with the management body, that person cannot be 
</p>
<p>readmitted to the same centre.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Special categories of detainees 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>89. Article 8 (1) of Legislative Decree 140/2005 stipulates that any accommodation 
</p>
<p>provided should take into account the special needs of the asylum seekers and their family 
</p>
<p>members, in particular those who are vulnerable, such as children, disabled persons, elderly 
</p>
<p>people, pregnant women, single parents with minor children and persons who have been 
</p>
<p>subjected to torture, rape or other forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence. It 
</p>
<p>also stipulates that the managers of reception centres are to provide adequate psychological 
</p>
<p>support in order to address the special needs of vulnerable asylum seekers. However, 
</p>
<p>special needs assessment is not always carried out systematically and in some cases the 
</p>
<p>required facilities and services cannot be provided. In addition, Legislative Decree 
</p>
<p>140/2005 specifies that asylum seekers, wherever possible, are to be accommodated in 
</p>
<p>structures that ensure the protection of family unity. Sometimes a father is accommodated 
</p>
<p>in a wing for single men and his wife and children are placed in a separate wing for women 
</p>
<p>or single parents with children. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Minors 
</b></p>
<p>90. Italy still lacks an adequate multidisciplinary age determination procedure, which is 
</p>
<p>necessary to ensure that children are treated as such and are granted forms of protection 
</p>
<p>tailored to their specific vulnerabilities and needs. The Special Rapporteur notes that the 
</p>
<p>current emphasis on age determination, which currently includes wrist X-rays and body 
</p>
<p>examination and the application of the benefit of the doubt for children who manifestly 
</p>
<p>appear to be under 18, seems a cautious approach that favours protection over expediency. 
</p>
<p>The test will be whether it is possible to sustain the political resolve necessary to implement 
</p>
<p>the policy over the long term. Particularly worrying is the situation of unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>minors who seem to lack adequate protection. All unaccompanied minors are provided with 
</p>
<p>a legally appointed guardian. However, the guardian, who is often the Mayor, the 
</p>
<p>Councillor of Social Affairs or a municipal official, can be responsible for over 60 minors 
</p>
<p>at any one time. The Special Rapporteur urges Italian authorities to develop a more 
</p>
<p>structured system of guardianship for unaccompanied minors. It is important for their 
</p>
<p>protection and development that the guardian be appointed quickly, have the necessary 
</p>
<p>expertise, capacity, experience and competence, be appropriately supported with the 
</p>
<p>necessary resources, and not be responsible for an excessive number of minors. The best 
</p>
<p>interest of the child depends on the guardian being able to make the best and quickest 
</p>
<p>decisions possible on all matters of concern to the child.  
</p>
<p>91. Another issue of concern is that young people in reception centres are not always 
</p>
<p>engaged in any educational or vocational activity. Consequently, they sometimes engage in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and prostitution, to earn money. Those arrested 
</p>
<p>and found guilty of such crimes serve their sentences in a juvenile penitentiary; once they 
</p>
<p>are 18, they are returned to a reception centre, if they have completed their sentence, or sent 
</p>
<p>to an adult prison to serve out the rest of their sentence. The Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that new legislation on providing improved reception centres for unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>minors, including management aspects, will be developed. The resources for the centres 
</p>
<p>will no longer come from strained municipal budgets, but rather from a central budget. 
</p>
<p>Regarding unaccompanied minors who arrive in Italy but do not want to stay, Italy should 
</p>
<p>establish a process with other countries that helps minors reach, as quickly as possible, their 
</p>
<p>preferred country of destination, thereby helping them avoid transit through countries 
</p>
<p>where conditions are dangerous or being led into criminal activity. 
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur learned that Italy will be adopting a bill to better protect 
</p>
<p>migrant children and assist in their integration. The idea of offering such children 
</p>
<p>integration avenues through language training, schooling and professional training 
</p>
<p>programmes is promising, as most young people will adapt quickly to their new 
</p>
<p>environment and become productive citizens. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of 
</p>
<p>several bills designed to allow easier access to Italian citizenship for migrants born in Italy 
</p>
<p>and for young people educated in Italy, which is a positive step towards the integration of 
</p>
<p>migrant children. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that barriers to access to justice exist at 
</p>
<p>many different stages of the processes of migration to Italy.  
</p>
<p>94. Issues around access to justice can sometimes arise at the border. Some migrants 
</p>
<p>have reportedly been returned upon apprehension when entering irregularly, commonly 
</p>
<p>known as push-back; others have been found at the border and admitted provisionally to 
</p>
<p>Italian territory for reasons of emergency health-care assistance, but were then returned, 
</p>
<p>which is known as deferred push-back. Such practices may exclude migrants from the 
</p>
<p>procedural guarantees linked to the ordinary expulsion procedure, thereby denying migrants 
</p>
<p>the opportunity to submit an asylum claim.  
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about access to justice for migrants who, 
</p>
<p>after arriving in Italy, apply for asylum while in detention. When a migrant who is detained 
</p>
<p>in an identification and expulsion centre makes an application for asylum, the expulsion 
</p>
<p>order is suspended, pending the evaluation of the application. However, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur learned that, despite this safeguard, some migrants detained in identification 
</p>
<p>and expulsion centre had been deported, even though they had previously expressed their 
</p>
<p>desire to make an asylum claim. 
</p>
<p>96. In addition, migrants are also often not able to obtain legal advice before submitting 
</p>
<p>their asylum claim. This creates problems later, when legitimate cases are rejected owing to 
</p>
<p>a lack of information on how best to submit the claim. Some migrants are unaware that 
</p>
<p>some of their experiences amount to torture, making them eligible for an asylum claim. In 
</p>
<p>other cases, migrants are given the information they need to submit a claim, but often may 
</p>
<p>be too traumatized to respond effectively. Consequently, although the asylum application 
</p>
<p>must be submitted immediately upon arrival in Italy, often victims of violence are unable to 
</p>
<p>report immediately the violence they experienced. They only learn of the importance of 
</p>
<p>such reports after their claim has been rejected; some, if they are fortunate, are able to then 
</p>
<p>submit such information when they appeal. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>97. Migrants who receive an expulsion order risk being returned, owing to the lack of 
</p>
<p>automatic suspensive effect of appeals against such orders and the practical difficulties of 
</p>
<p>lodging appeals &#8212; the procedure does not allow sufficient time to contact a lawyer, or even 
</p>
<p>an interpreter. Moreover, the judges deciding whether expulsion and detention orders 
</p>
<p>should be extended are justices of the peace without any particular expertise in immigration 
</p>
<p>issues. The ability of these lay judges to review the detention orders on the merits seems to 
</p>
<p>be limited; rather, the confirmation of the detention orders is perceived to be, in many 
</p>
<p>cases, based on mere formalities, thus resulting in a lack of real judicial control over the 
</p>
<p>order. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges the Government to streamline expulsion and 
</p>
<p>detention orders so as to ensure that the relevant procedures work well to protect those in 
</p>
<p>need and allow for improved access to justice.  
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the appeal system for expulsion and 
</p>
<p>detention orders is unnecessarily complex, requiring two parallel appeal procedures in the 
</p>
<p>city where the order was made, which often requires the hiring of a local lawyer. This can 
</p>
<p>be very difficult for migrants to navigate, as they may not speak the language and may have 
</p>
<p>limited access to information in detention facilities; often, their access to funds or legal 
</p>
<p>advice is restricted. Even if the expulsion and detention orders were issued in the same city, 
</p>
<p>the bifurcation of the process still requires two separate proceedings.  
</p>
<p>99. Migrants within Italy still have problems obtaining competent and reliable legal 
</p>
<p>representation. Some are able to obtain legal advice and support from NGOs. Others are 
</p>
<p>able to engage private lawyers, but remain easy targets for dishonest lawyers who wish to 
</p>
<p>make extra money. The Special Rapporteur urges the Italian authorities to work with bar 
</p>
<p>associations to ensure that migrants are able to gain access to competent legal 
</p>
<p>representation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>100. Legislative Decree No. 109/2012, which transposed into national law Directive 
</p>
<p>2009/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on sanctions against employers, 
</p>
<p>has yet to be fully implemented. Employers continue to exploit migrants physically and 
</p>
<p>financially without fear of sanctions.  
</p>
<p>101. Labour inspectors should respect and protect the human rights of workers, 
</p>
<p>irrespective of their status, and certainly should not have immigration enforcement powers, 
</p>
<p>which only serves to deter migrants from reporting exploitation because they fear being 
</p>
<p>arrested, detained and deported. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Xenophobic and discriminatory acts against migrants 
</b></p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur learned that migrants continued to be victims of violent 
</p>
<p>attacks and murders in recent years, with both mob violence and individual attacks 
</p>
<p>reported. At the same time, the number of prosecutions for racially motivated attacks is 
</p>
<p>low, owing to a lack of general awareness about the law and insufficient training for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement and judicial personnel.  
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the terminology and discourse 
</p>
<p>around migration used by some government institutions and agencies. The term clandestine 
</p>
<p>remains in widespread use, in particular by the media. Such language further legitimizes a 
</p>
<p>discourse of exclusion and criminalization of migration, which then entrenches attitudes of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and xenophobia and creates an environment in which the exploitation of 
</p>
<p>irregular migrants is perceived as legitimate. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>104. Xenophobic and racist discourse, including by elected officials and other public 
</p>
<p>figures, contributes to a climate of impunity and intolerance. Law No. 654/1975 of 
</p>
<p>13 October 1975 criminalized incitement to racial hatred. However, in practice, even Italian 
</p>
<p>politicians found guilty of such crimes were not penalized for their conduct.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Normative and institutional framework for the protection  
</b></p>
<p><b>of the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Develop a comprehensive national system of data collection, analysis and 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissemination regarding immigration policies and practices, which should be used as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>foundation for rights-based policymaking on migration. Data relating to migrants in 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention and deportations should also be included</b>;  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Establish a national human rights institution in line with the principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights (the Paris Principles), and ensure that it is both functionally and 
</b></p>
<p><b>financially independent of the Government and vested with the authority to 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigate all issues relating to human rights, including those of migrants, regardless 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their administrative status;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure the establishment of a fully independent national preventive 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism, in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate to visit all places where migrants may be deprived of their liberty;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(d) Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Border management 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Fully respect the human rights of migrants when implementing 
</b></p>
<p><b>readmission agreements;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that readmission and cooperation agreements aimed at, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia, combating irregular migration include safeguards for the full respect of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of migrants and ensure the adequate protection of vulnerable migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including asylum seekers and refugees, in particular with regard to the principle of 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-refoulement;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(c) Establish a comprehensive mechanism for the identification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>unaccompanied minors that includes not only medical exams but also a psychosocial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural approach, in order to best identify specific protection measures in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>best interests of each child.</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Bilateral agreements 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)</b> <b>Ensure that all bilateral and multilateral agreements on migration issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>are negotiated and made publicly available in full transparency, with clear human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights protections integrated at all stages;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Eliminate the practice of informal automatic push-backs to Greece;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that readmission agreements, such as those with Egypt and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Tunisia, adequately protect the human rights of migrants and ensure proper and

</b></p>
<p><b>access by international organizations and civil society organizations, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>Praesidium project members, at landing sites and to all temporary and permanent 
</b></p>
<p><b>reception centres. The Praesidium project should be formalized.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Detention and reception 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that migrants are detained only when they present a danger to 
</b></p>
<p><b>themselves or others or a demonstrated risk of absconding from future proceedings, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>always ensure that detention is used for the shortest time possible and as a measure of

</p>
<p><b> (b) Improve and standardize the management of reception centres for

</b></p>
<p><b>of reception centres and in other facilities in Europe and around the world, and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with relevant standards set out in international human rights law;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that all detained migrants have access to proper medical care, 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpreters, adequate food and clothing, hygienic conditions, adequate space to move 
</b></p>
<p><b>around and outdoor exercise;</b>

<p><b>understand, of the reason for their detention, its duration and their rights to access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>a lawyer, to promptly challenge their detention and to seek asylum;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Implement legislation concerning the early identification of migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>prisoners to avoid further detention;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that all migrants deprived of their liberty are able to promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and easily contact their family, consular services and a lawyer, which should be free of 
</b></p>
<p><b>charge;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (g) Guarantee full access by international organizations, including UNHCR 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, doctors, journalists and lawyers, to all areas where migrants are held 
</b></p>
<p><b>or detained, at all stages of the procedure, including in reception centres;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (h) Develop comprehensive human rights training programmes for all staff

</b></p>
<p><b>determine asylum claims;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Establish a fairer and simpler system for migrant detainees to be able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge expulsion and detention orders, and ensure that the appeal proceedings are 
</b></p>
<p><b>based on the merits and validation of the detention;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Provide justices of the peace with training on international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law and international refugee law;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that migrants awaiting a judicial decision on their request to 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspend repatriation procedures, following a negative decision made by the competent 
</b></p>
<p><b>territorial commission, are not repatriated before the decision on suspension is made.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Provide access to basic services to everyone living on Italian territory, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regardless of their immigration status, in accordance with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Take all necessary measures to execute the judgements of the European 
</b></p>
<p><b>Court of Human Rights in the Hirsi and Sharifi cases;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Fully implement the directive on sanctioning employers, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing comprehensive measures to punish Italian employers who abuse the 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability of migrants by paying them exploitative wages;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Effectively penalize landlords who house migrants in inappropriate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>unsanitary conditions; </b> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Use terminology that does not reinforce prejudices against migrants, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>refrain from using charged expressions s</b>uch as &#8220;illegal migrant&#8221; or &#8220;clandestin<b>e</b>&#8221;<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b>take a leadership role in developing a political discourse that stresses the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights for all, including migrants, regardless of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative status;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Support, both technically and financially, civil society organizations that 
</b></p>
<p><b>offer services and support to migrants regardless of their administrative status, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially those that help migrants defend their rights;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (g) Develop and implement a national diversity and integration programme.  </b></p>

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to the European Union 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the European Union: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that European Union frameworks do not contribute to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>restriction of human rights protections of migrants in Italy;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that European cooperation frameworks with partner countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>do not result in the externalization of border controls without adequate human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees in favour of migrants being implemented, with the support of European 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, in such partner countries;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Establish a programme for the quick relocation of asylum seekers across 
</b></p>
<p><b>Europe, according to a distribution key and taking into account the wishes of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum seekers themselves, the possibilities of family reunification and humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>considerations that are essential to an equitable redistribution of responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>among States. If well managed, such a system would incentivize asylum seekers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>register in the first European Union country of entry. It would encourage asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>seekers not to use the evasion tactics that are now systematically employed to avoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>their identification and the application of the Dublin regulations;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Accept the inevitability of increased migration to the European Union 
</b></p>
<p><b>region. The European Union and its member States therefore need to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>channels for regular migration into Europe;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure a well-managed reception capacity that can sustain the expected 
</b></p>
<p><b>seasonal migration peaks. Fully accept the shared responsibility among all member 
</b></p>
<p><b>States; for example, some States could offer part of their reception capacity to other 
</b></p>
<p><b>front-line States experiencing migration peaks;</b> 
</p>
<p>112. <b>European Union member States must strive to create a common asylum policy, 
by embracing two mechanisms. First, States should recogniz</b>e each other&#8217;s <b>refugee 
status determination decisions, thus ensuring the mobility of refugees throughout the 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory of the European Union</b>. Second, in order to gain confidence in each other&#8217;s 
<b>refugee status determination systems, they should create a roster of decision makers 
</b></p>
<p><b>from each European Union member State, at first decision and at appeals levels, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the joint screening of asylum applications. With the help of the European Asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>Support Office and UNHCR, this would allow for the sharing of expertise, experience, 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practices and lessons learned. It would also help create trust in the capacity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>each national system through the knowledge that it is grounded on a common 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge base of country-of-origin information, to be developed around a common 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpretation of the legal criteria for protection and to be responsive to the same 
</b></p>
<p><b>factors as considered in other systems. </b> 
</p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the European Union:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that the cooperation with FRONTEX takes full account of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of migrants, rather than focusing only on security-related aspects;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Promote family reunification between unaccompanied minors, both 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum seekers and other migrants, and their relatives who are regularly resident in 
</b></p>
<p><b>other European Union member States;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure the full implementation of responsibility sharing among 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Union member States in the management of its external borders, taking 
</b></p>
<p><b>into full account the geographical position of Italy, which renders its coastlines 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly exposed to migration flows. This should include allowing asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p><b>the freedom of movement within the European Union and attributing European 
</b></p>
<p><b>Union support funds to the country where asylum seekers establish themselves. </b>
