<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council

<p><b>  27/1  
</b></p>
<p><b>Enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that protect the right to life, the 
</p>
<p>right to liberty and security of person, the right not to be subjected to torture and the right to 
</p>
<p>recognition as a person before the law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 
</p>
<p>1980, in which the Commission decided to establish a working group of five members to 
</p>
<p>serve as experts in their individual capacity and to examine questions relevant to enforced 
</p>
<p>or involuntary disappearances, and also all previous resolutions on this subject, in particular 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolutions 7/12 of 27 March 2008 and 16/16 of 24 March 2011, in 
</p>
<p>which the Council renewed by consensus the mandate of the Working Group on Enforced 
</p>
<p>or Involuntary Disappearances, as well as Council decision 25/116 of 27 March 2014 and 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 21/4 of 27 September 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, by which 
</p>
<p>the Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance as a body of principles for States, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the fact that 98 States have signed the International Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and that 43 States have ratified or 
</p>
<p>acceded to it, and recognizing that its implementation is a significant contribution to ending 
</p>
<p>impunity and to the promotion and the protection of all human rights for all, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> <i>in particular</i> by the increase in enforced or involuntary 
</p>
<p>disappearances in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, 
</p>
<p>when these are part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number 
</p>
<p>of reports concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of 
</p>
<p>disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared, 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling</i> that the Convention sets out the right of victims to know the truth 
</p>
<p>regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and the result of 
</p>
<p>the investigation and the fate of the disappeared person, and sets forth State party 
</p>
<p>obligations to take appropriate measures in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note with interest</i> of the recommendation made by the Working Group that 
</p>
<p>more assistance should be provided to family members and members of civil society in 
</p>
<p>order to enable them to report alleged cases of enforced disappearances to the Working 
</p>
<p>Group, given that, in a large number of cases, the underreporting of cases of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances remains a major problem due to various reasons including, inter alia, fear of 
</p>
<p>reprisals, weak administration of justice, poverty and illiteracy,1 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note with interest</i> <i>also</i> of the general comments of the Working Group on the 
</p>
<p>right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances,<footnote name="2">See A/HRC/16/48, para. 39. 
</footnote> on children and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances,<footnote name="3">A/HRC/WGEID/98/1 and Corr.1. 
</footnote> and on women affected by enforced disappearances,<footnote name="4">A/HRC/WGEID/98/2. 
</footnote> as well as of its 
</p>
<p>general comment on enforced disappearance as a crime of a continuous nature,<footnote name="5">See A/HRC16/48, para. 39. 
</footnote> and in this 
</p>
<p>regard recalling the relevant provisions of the Convention and the Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the fact that acts of enforced disappearance may amount to crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity as it is defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the decision of the General Assembly to declare 30 August International 
</p>
<p>Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, as well as the decision of the Assembly in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 65/196 of 21 December 2010 to proclaim, pursuant to the recommendation 
</p>
<p>made by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 14/7 of 17 June 2010, 24 March as the 
</p>
<p>International Day for the Right to the Truth concerning Gross Human Rights Violations and 
</p>
<p>for the Dignity of Victims, and its call upon Member States, the United Nations system and 
</p>
<p>other international and regional organizations, as well as civil society, to observe these 
</p>
<p>days, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that many States cooperate with the Working Group, and 
</p>
<p>encouraging States to cooperate with the Working Group, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
</p>
<p>Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
</p>
<p>Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
</p>
<p>duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the 
</p>
<p>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance to 
</p>
<p>consider doing so as a matter of priority, and to consider as well the option provided for in 
</p>
<p>articles 31 and 32 of the Convention regarding the Committee on Enforced Disappearances; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the reports of the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances,<footnote name="6">A/HRC/22/45 and Corr.1, and A/HRC/27/49. </footnote> and encourages States to give due consideration 
</p>
<p>to the comments and recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Welcomes</i> the important work undertaken by the Working Group to address 
</p>
<p>all situations of enforced disappearances, and encourages the Working Group to pursue the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of its mandate as set out by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 7/12; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>4. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the cooperation established between the Working Group and 
</p>
<p>the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, as well as with other relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures and treaty bodies, within the framework of their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Working Group for a further period of 
</p>
<p>three years, in conformity with the terms set forth in Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>7/12; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not provided for a long period of time substantive 
</p>
<p>replies concerning claims of enforced disappearances in their countries to do so, and to give 
</p>
<p>due consideration to relevant recommendations concerning this issue made by the Working 
</p>
<p>Group in its reports; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> the Working Group, in accordance with its working methods, to 
</p>
<p>continue to provide concerned States with relevant and detailed information concerning 
</p>
<p>allegations of enforced disappearances in order to facilitate a prompt and substantive 
</p>
<p>response to these communications without prejudice to the need for concerned States to 
</p>
<p>cooperate with the Working Group; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Notes with concern</i> that, according to the Working Group, it has insufficient 
</p>
<p>resources to exercise its mandate effectively, particularly in relation to human resources, 
</p>
<p>where there is an acute need,<footnote name="7">A/HRC/27/49, para. 122. </footnote> and requests the Secretary-General to provide the Working 
</p>
<p>Group with all the resources and assistance necessary for it to be able to sustainably fulfil 
</p>
<p>its mandate effectively, in particular by putting adequate and predictable human and 
</p>
<p>material resources at its disposal; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Decides </i>to continue consideration of the question of enforced disappearances 
</p>
<p>in accordance with its programme of work. 
</p>
