</b></p>
<p><b>26/15  Accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women: violence against women as a barrier to women&#8217;s political 
and economic empowerment 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> <i>also </i>by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and 
Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, as well as those of 
the Commission on Human Rights, on the elimination of all forms of violence against 
women, and recalling also relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and relevant 
resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, </p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the important role that can be played by the regional instruments to 
combat violence against women, 
</p>
<p><i>Outraged</i> about the continued persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence 
against women and girls worldwide, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, 
abuse or impairment of human rights and as such is unacceptable, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> the need to intensify efforts at all levels to prevent and eliminate all 
forms of violence against women and girls throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and 
structural inequality in power relations between women and men, and that all forms of 
</p>

<p>violence against women and girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability 
of women and girls to make use of their capabilities, </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a 
permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, 
services and basic activities, and impedes their economic and political empowerment, </p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the need for States, and all segments of society, including civil society 
organizations, the private sector and the media, as well as community leaders, including 
tribal leaders, and religious leaders to take meaningful steps to promote the empowerment 
of women and girls in order to achieve gender equality and to strongly condemn and 
address attitudes and behaviours that perpetuate violence against women and girls, </p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that any custom, tradition or religious consideration should not be invoked 
by States to avoid their obligations with respect to the elimination of all forms of violence 
against women and girls, as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence 
against Women,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the important role that men and boys can play in preventing and 
eliminating violence against women and girls, and further encouraging men and boys to 
take an active part and become strategic partners and allies in the prevention and 
elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls, and the 
importance of effectively responding to violence against boys as well, in order to break the 
intergenerational cycles of violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that poverty and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their 
marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of 
education, health and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, 
and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, are 
impediments to the development of their full potential as equal partners in all aspects of 
life, as well as obstacles to the achievement of the internationally agreed development 
goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the continuing need to increase women&#8217;s full and effective 
participation in all actions and activities related to the prevention and resolution of armed 
conflict, the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peacebuilding in line with 
relevant Security Council resolutions, including Council resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 
October 2000 and related resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>further </i>that child, early and forced marriage continues to be an 
impediment to not only the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but 
also to the development of the community as a whole, and that the empowerment of and 
investment in women and girls, as well as their meaningful participation in decisions that 
affect them, are a key factor in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, 
violence and poverty and is critical for sustainable development and economic growth, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> about institutional and structural discrimination against women 
and girls, such as laws, policies, regulations, programmes, administrative procedures or 
structures and services that directly or indirectly regulate access to institutions, property and 
land ownership, health, education, employment and access to credit, which negatively 
affect women&#8217;s empowerment and increase their vulnerability to violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that indigenous women and girls, women and girls with disabilities, 
older women, women migrants and minorities often experience multiple forms of 
discrimination, which may increase their vulnerability to all forms of violence and limit 
their ability to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political 
autonomy, </p>


<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that social norms and legal constraints that restrict women&#8217;s 
agency in the public and private sphere and their economic independence can constrain a 
woman&#8217;s ability to leave an abusive or violent situation and reduce her ability to access 
protection and to secure an adequate standard of living, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that violence against women has both short- and long-term adverse 
consequences for women&#8217;s health, including their sexual and reproductive health, and for 
the enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and 
reproductive health, and protecting and fulfilling reproductive rights in accordance with the 
Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the 
Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences is a 
necessary condition to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women to enable 
them to enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to prevent and mitigate 
violence against women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also </i>the important role of the United Nations system, in particular of 
the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, in 
addressing discrimination and violence against women and girls at the global, regional and 
national levels and in assisting States, upon their request, in their efforts to eliminate and 
prevent all forms of violence against women and girls, and highlighting the relevance of 
such efforts to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the work of the Statistical Commission of the United Nations and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, towards 
developing a set of indicators on violence against women, </p>
<p><i>Underscoring</i> the positive role that intergovernmental organizations, international 
financial institutions, regional development banks, civil society, including non-
governmental organizations, the private sector, employer organizations, trade unions, media 
and other relevant organizations can play in supporting State action to promote women&#8217;s 
economic empowerment and political participation, which can help to reduce violence 
against women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking particular note</i> of the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on 
the Post-2015 Development Agenda,1 and noting other relevant contributions by United 
Nations agencies, programmes and funds on the post-2015 development agenda, which 
highlight the impact of violence against women and girls on development outcomes and 
consider the elimination of violence against women and women&#8217;s empowerment as a key 
factor for achieving gender equality, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all acts of violence against women and girls, whether 
these acts are perpetrated by the State, private persons or non-State actors, and calls for the 
prevention and elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the 
general community and where perpetrated or condoned by the State; </p>
<p>2. <i>Urges</i> States and all segments of society, including all levels of government, 
civil society organizations, the private sector and the media, as well as community and 
religious leaders, to take meaningful steps to address the harmful attitudes, customs, 
practices, stereotypes and unequal power relations that underlie and perpetuate violence 
against women and girls, including by designing, implementing and evaluating national 
policies, programmes and strategies aimed at transforming social norms that condone 
violence against women and girls, and to counteract attitudes by which women and girls are

<p>regarded as subordinate to men and boys or as having stereotyped roles that perpetuate 
practices involving violence or coercion; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to develop or strengthen comprehensive national women-
centred multisectoral responses involving relevant authorities in sectors such as justice, 
health, social services, education and child protection services, as well as relevant non-State 
actors, that focus on the prevention of violence, the provision of support services for 
victims and survivors of violence and the punishment of perpetrators to enable 
accountability and to promote the empowerment of women and girls by changing harmful 
attitudes, practices and stereotypes; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Underlines</i> the detrimental impact of sexual violence in armed conflict on 
women&#8217;s participation in the resolution of conflict, post-conflict transition, reconstruction, 
and peacebuilding processes, takes note of international and regional initiatives to combat 
sexual violence in armed conflict, and acknowledges with appreciation in this context the 
Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, which launched the International 
Protocol on the Documentation and Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict as a tool to 
promote accountability and victim support; </p>
<p>5. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> that violence against women and girls severely

development goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals, including goals on 
education, health, gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls;

<p>(<i>e</i>) Ensuring that legal provisions accord women an equal status in law and in 
practice, including in relation to the head-of-household provisions in family law and 
custody law, and guaranteeing women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; inheritance rights and their full and
