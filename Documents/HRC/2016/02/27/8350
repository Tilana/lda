<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  Annual meetings of special rapporteurs, representatives, independent experts and 
chairs of working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Right Council have been held since 1994. The Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 
1993, underlined the importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special 
procedures and specified that the procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to 
harmonize and rationalize their work through periodic meetings (A/CONF.157/24 (Part I), 
part II, para. 95). 
</p>
<p>2. Mandate holders exchanged views with the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the President of the Human Rights Council, the facilitator of the Human 
Rights Council review segment relating to special procedures, and States. A joint meeting 
was convened with the twelfth inter-committee meeting of treaty bodies, and the special 
procedures mandate holders also met with representatives of United Nations entities, 
headquarters and field presences staff of the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR), 
representatives of non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>3. The meeting was opened by the Chair of the seventeenth annual meeting and Chair 
of the Coordination Committee of special procedures, Najat Maalla M&#8217;jid, She welcomed 
the recently appointed mandate holders, and expressed profound thanks to the outgoing 
mandate holders for their work and contributions. She also welcomed the observers to the 
meeting, including the Special Rapporteur on Disabilities of the Commission on Social 
Development of the Economic and Social Council. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, was elected 
Chair of the eighteenth annual meeting and of the Coordination Committee; the 
independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti, Michel Forst, was elected 
Rapporteur of the meeting and a member of the Coordination Committee. The Chair of the 
Working Group on the elimination of discrimination against women in law and in practice, 
Kamala Chandrakirana, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, Juan Mendez, and the Chair of the Working Group on 
enforced or involuntary disappearances, Jeremy Sarkin, were endorsed as the other three 
members of the Committee selected by the meeting Chair Maalla M&#8217;jid, who, as former 
Chairwill remain as an ex officio member during the coming year.  
</p>
<p>5. The provisional agenda was adopted as revised. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Activities of the Coordination Committee 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Chair of the Coordination Committee briefed participants on the activities of the 
Committee in 2010/11, and made suggestions on how to strengthen the special procedures 
system. She thanked all mandate holders for their valuable contributions, and their 
encouragement and confidence throughout the year.  
</p>
<p>7. The Coordination Committee had focused on the engagement of the system with the 
Human Rights Council review and follow-up to the seventeenth annual meeting to improve 
working methods and cooperation with OHCHR. The Committee had ensured that the 
special procedures provided a joint contribution to the review, which emphasized their 
independence, cooperation by States, resources and the importance of the protection of 
persons cooperating with the special procedures system against reprisals. It had underlined 
the importance of the participation of mandate holders in the review process, including in </p>


<p>the inter-governmental working group, and through engagement with the President of the 
Council and the facilitator of the special procedures segment.  
</p>
<p>8. As part of the measures to improve working methods and to promote dialogue, the 
Coordination Committee and OHCHR had discussed questions frequently asked by special 
procedures and possible answers. The Chair noted that these discussions took into account 
aspects raised during the review, and information contained in the manual, which itself 
might warrant review, given the developments since its finalization. Discussions had not 
concluded and she encouraged the incoming Committee to continue to approach these as an 
ongoing process. Other Committee activities had included coordination of joint action, such 
as statements for special sessions and on the occasion of Human Rights Day; contribution 
to the selection procedure for new mandate holders; the formulation of proposals to 
enhance working methods; promoting dialogue and strengthening constructive engagement 
with States, suggesting further work on concrete recommendations to strengthen States&#8217; 
capacity; and cooperation with other mechanisms, such as the treaty bodies and the 
universal periodic review mechanism of the Human Rights Council. Dissemination of 
information had been facilitated through an orientation session for new mandate holders 
and meetings with other new experts. The Committee had introduced a regular letter from 
the Chair to update mandate holders on Committee activities.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to the code of conduct, no formal complaints had been received under 
the internal advisory procedure during the past cycle, but the Coordination Committee had 
provided individual guidance to mandate holders on working methods in a number of cases. 
There was a need for the Committee to remain proactive in responding to issues raised 
under the code of conduct and to continue to champion the independence of mandate 
holders.   
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Exchange of views with the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>10.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights assured the meeting that 
she consistently emphasized the importance and added value of special procedures in the 
global system for the promotion and protection of human rights. She noted the high-quality 
professional support provided by OHCHR staff in Geneva, New York and Office&#8217;s more 
than 50 field presences, and that the synergy between her Office and special procedures 
could be strengthened in order to maximize impact in implementation of human rights. She 
highlighted recent developments, including in countries in the Middle East and North 
Africa, and commended the special procedures for seizing opportunities to engage with 
States, including through recent visits, communications, outreach and technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>11. The High Commissioner referred to the role of special procedures in major thematic 
areas, such as the International Year of People of African Descent; the tenth anniversary of 
the Durban Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance; the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration 
on the Right to Development; the open-ended working group on ageing of the General 
Assembly; and the work on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. She 
commended the Coordination Committee for facilitating the common contribution by all 
mandate holders to the Human Rights Council review and for working with OHCHR on 
questions frequently asked by mandate holders. She encouraged mandate holders to 
consider updating the manual. On resources, she pointed out that the current financial 
climate, additional mandates and additional mandated activities had stretched the capacity 
of OHCHR to support mandate holders, and limited the scope of action of mandate holders, 
and that she was doing her utmost to secure additional regular budget resources for special 
procedures. Transparency relating to external support was important in order to counter 
perceptions that the independence and integrity of mandate holders could be compromised.  </p>


<p>12.  Discussions were held on the best use of synergy between the special procedures and 
the High Commissioner for maximum impact in the implementation of human rights; how 
best to advocate in the Human Rights Council; effective strategies to attract more regular 
budget and extra-budgetary resources; and ways in which field presences could integrate 
the work of special procedures at the national and local levels and within United Nations 
country teams more fully, including through collaboration with the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) to enhance the understanding of country representatives 
of the human rights mechanisms. Mandate holders expressed appreciation that some of their 
concerns raised at the seventeenth annual meeting had been addressed, but indicated that 
work was required on outstanding issues and that the Coordination Committee would seek 
to address these in partnership with OHCHR. Concern was raised in relation to conference 
servicing constraints, such as with regard to translation and the recruitment of local 
interpreters rather than of those based at the United Nations Office at Geneva for the visits 
of mandate holders, taking into account the integrity of the process and the safety of those 
cooperating with mandate holders and the interpreters themselves. Furthermore, concerns 
were raised in relation to inconsistencies among working groups in terms of meeting time 
and the number of missions. The High Commissioner was asked to provide information on 
the focus of her future thematic priorities, as these could be drawn upon by mandate 
holders. The importance of capitalizing on the linkages among the special procedures, the 
treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council and the universal periodic review was highlighted. 
Proactive engagement by special procedures with the United Nations at large, and the 
importance of linkages between the work of special procedures and OHCHR, was 
emphasized, as was flow of information, including from United Nations country teams.  
</p>
<p><b> V.  Human Rights Council and the special procedures system 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>13. Participants exchanged views with the President of the Human Rights Council, 
Laura Dupuy Lasserre, Permanent Representative of Uruguay to the United Nations Office 
at Geneva, who highlighted the fact that the work of the special procedures was essential 
for the protection of human rights, as it alerted the Council to emerging problems, and 
provided information and expertise in an independent manner on thematic and country-
specific issues. She also stressed the importance of the regular participation of the special 
procedures in special sessions of the Council, including through innovative means, noting 
the recent example of a statement of all mandate holders delivered via video technology at 
the sixteenth special session. 
</p>
<p>14.  The facilitator of the Human Rights Council review process on special procedures, 
Hannu Himanen, Permanent Representative of Finland to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva, underlined the good and regular contacts he had had with the previous chair of the 
Coordination Committee, in particular in the context of the Council review and discussed 
resolution 16/21 on the review of the work and functioning of the Council, as adopted by 
the General Assembly in its resolution 65/281 on the outcome of the review. Where special 
procedures were concerned, the outcome had addressed selection and appointment of 
mandate holders, working methods, resources and funding.  
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the selection process of mandate holders, the Human Rights Council, 
in the annex to resolution 16/21, envisaged that individual candidates would submit an 
application, accompanied by a short motivation letter, and the Consultative Group would 
interview shortlisted candidates to ensure equal treatment of all candidates. National human 
rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles now may also nominate 
candidates. With regard to working methods, the review reaffirmed that States should 
cooperate with mandate holders in the performance of their tasks; it was incumbent on 
mandate holders to exercise their functions in accordance with their mandates and in 
compliance with the code of conduct. Their integrity and independence and the principles </p>


<p>of cooperation, transparency and accountability are integral to ensuring a robust system to 
enhance the capacity of the Council to address human rights situations on the ground. The 
national human rights institution of the country concerned would be entitled to intervene 
immediately after that country during the interactive dialogue following a mandate holder&#8217;s 
presentation of a country mission report. OHCHR will continue to maintain information on 
special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner and any act of 
intimidation or reprisal against individuals and groups who cooperate with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights was strongly 
rejected. 
</p>
<p>16. More transparency in special procedures resources and funding was a recurring 
theme throughout the review, and the outcome highlights the need for full transparency in 
this context, while recognizing the importance of ensuring the provision of adequate and 
equitable funding to the special procedures according to their specific needs through the 
regular budget. The Human Rights Council recognized the continued need for extra-
budgetary funding and welcomed further voluntary contributions, which should be, to the 
extent possible, unearmarked. 
</p>
<p>17. Participants agreed with the principle of transparency, and emphasized the 
importance of greater interaction to address misconceptions. Cooperation by States, through 
timely responses to requests for visits, including when a standing invitation has been 
issued, and communications were considered essential, and it was suggested that 
assessment of cooperation might be useful. Feedback was requested on the expectations of 
States in relation to constructive dialogue. It was suggested that outgoing mandate holders 
might provide a list of qualities required for incoming mandate holders to assist in 
selection. The modalities of how the comments of the State concerned would be included as 
an addendum to the country mission reports of mandate holders as required by the review 
outcome were raised. Concern was expressed that Council decision 17/119 on the follow-up 
to resolution 16/21 with regard to the universal periodic review, which emphasized that the 
second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation 
of accepted recommendations and the development of human rights situations in the State 
under review, could result in the weakening of special procedures recommendations that 
had not been accepted by the State under review. The point was made that these 
recommendations and any follow-up, such as communications or recent country visits, 
should be included under the rubric of the development of human rights situations in the 
State under review. Follow-up to special procedures recommendations was raised, as was 
the role of special procedures in following up on universal periodic recommendations and 
those of the treaty bodies, particularly in the light of the plethora of recommendations 
directed at States.  
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Thematic issues and working methods 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Strengthening follow-up, working with external support and enhancing 
information-sharing 
</b></p>
<p>18. Strengthening mechanisms and structures for follow-up and implementation of 
recommendations, working with external support, enhancing information-sharing among 
mandate holders, with OHCHR, and other stakeholders, and common issues relating to the 
five special procedures working groups were discussed by mandate holders and OHCHR.  
</p>
<p><b>  1.  Strengthening mechanisms and structures for follow-up to and implementation 
of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>19. Participants noted that the primary responsibility for implementation rested with 
States. Mandate holders and United Nations entities had a strong interest and responsibility </p>


<p>to enhance follow-up and to strengthen their cooperation and coordination to that end. 
Ways in which recommendations were taken into account through existing mechanisms and 
procedures, including other human rights mechanisms, such as the universal periodic 
review and the procedures of treaty bodies, entities such as OHCHR field presences, New 
York-based bodies such as the Peacebuilding Commission, and in the development and 
implementation by New York-based bodies of Common Country Assessments and United 
Nations Development Assistance Frameworks  and other national level mechanisms, were 
discussed. The initiatives of several individual mandates in relation to follow-up were 
highlighted, with the differences between country and thematic mandates being taken into 
account. These included regional consultations to take stock of the status of implementation 
of recommendations in countries of a particular region; and follow-up reports and visits and 
the practice of sending letters and questionnaires to Governments and other stakeholders to 
seek feedback on the status of implementation of recommendations on a systematic basis. 
Feedback was used to inform strategies and work plans of mandate holders. A compilation 
of good practices on follow-up was recommended. 
</p>
<p><b>  2.   External support  
</b></p>
<p>20. Participants were briefed on the effects of the current financial climate on the United 
Nations and OHCHR, particularly in the light of the fact that new mandates and additional 
tasks required of special procedures were not always funded. It was pointed out that, 
although statements of programme budget implications had been presented to the Human 
Rights Council, new activities were frequently required to be undertaken within existing 
resources. While increased regular budget funding was essential, voluntary funding from 
States, sometimes generated through the activities of mandate holders, had been very 
valuable, with the Office taking advantage of unearmarked contributions to ensure that 
resources were equitably distributed among mandates. The independence and integrity of 
mandate holders were underlined, and it was emphasized that contributions should come 
without conditions. Various arrangements to support mandate holders through a 
combination of United Nations and non-United Nations resources existed in the light of the 
insufficiency of regular budget resources. There were several positive examples of how 
staff within the United Nations and teams based outside the Organization worked together 
on the basis of a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities. The 
importance of transparency among and between mandate holders and OHCHR and 
disclosure of resources available for the functioning of the mandates was emphasized by 
mandate holders. Good practices in seeking and accepting non-OHCHR support were 
discussed, as were the different considerations to be taken into account in respect of country 
and thematic mandates. Mandate holders agreed that further work should be undertaken to 
enhance transparency and safeguard mandate holders&#8217; independence and impartiality. 
</p>
<p><b>  3.   Enhancing information-sharing 
</b></p>
<p>21. Ways to improve information-sharing on thematic issues, existing resources and 
tools, including the Universal Human Rights Index, were presented and discussed. While 
acknowledging the current workload and resource constraints, additional ways to 
institutionalize and exchange knowledge of thematic issues, tools and methodologies (for 
example, the preparation of missions, reports, formulation of recommendations and 
cooperation with United Nations agencies), including through new technologies, such as 
extranets or databases accessible by mandate holders and staff, were also considered. It was 
suggested that guidance on the use of new technologies to facilitate efficiency and 
effectiveness of the work of mandate holders be developed. It was recommended that 
reports should be made more user-friendly for the general public by, for example, including 
short summaries of the findings in more accessible language and making the thematic focus 
of reports more visible. Efforts to make the website more user-friendly, including though 
the posting of additional information on the impact of the work of mandates and cross-
cutting themes or mandates&#8217; thematic focus, were recommended. Suggestions on ways to </p>


<p>enhance provision of information on the thematic work of OHCHR and treaty body 
priorities (for example, future general comments and recommendations) through internal or 
external information tools were also discussed. 
</p>
<p><b>  4.  Special procedures working groups 
</b></p>
<p>22. Additional meetings and meeting time, extra resources for missions, participation by 
all or by at least two members of each working group in the annual meeting and the 
creation of further opportunities to exchange information about working group practices 
and procedures to ensure greater consistency were highlighted as common issues 
confronting the five special procedures working groups.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Strengthening the effectiveness of the special procedures: a joint report 
on communications 
</b></p>
<p>23. Mandate holders recalled that that, at their sixteenth annual meeting in 2009, they 
decided to report on their communications jointly (A/HRC/12/47, paras. 24-26), which was 
endorsed at the seventeenth annual meeting (A/HRC15/44, paras. 26-27). Mandate holders 
discussed methodological issues, including ways to reflect statistical and other information, 
given that the first joint communications report was to be submitted to the Human Rights 
Council at its eighteenth session.  
</p>
<p>24. It was recalled that two thirds of all communications were issued jointly by two or 
more mandate holders, but communications had been reported on in more than 20 
individual reports submitted as an addendum to main reports. The joint communications 
report, to be arranged chronologically, would increase consistency, transparency and 
efficiency, including by enabling communications and related State responses to be 
accessible in full. It would also reduce documentation costs  and respond to the call by the 
Human Rights Council to make documents available in accessible electronic formats. 
Victim protection measures relating to reporting on communications would also be 
implemented across mandates in a more harmonized manner.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Documentation issues 
</b></p>
<p>25.  Participants were briefed by representatives of the United Nations Office at Geneva 
on issues relating to documentation and interpretation and translation services. Guidelines 
regarding interpretation services during missions with human rights mechanisms were 
shared. Participants were informed of the increasing workload of translators and 
interpreters that has not been matched by commensurate increases in human or financial 
resources of the United Nations. They were informed of contracting arrangements with 
local interpreters through the relevant UNDP office or by the United Nations Office. 
Participants raised the concern that more frequent use of local interpreters could harm the 
integrity and credibility of special procedures and place the victims, their families and 
interpreters at risk of reprisal. Some participants raised concerns about editing and enquired 
about the possibility of reviewing translations. Some asked whether resources for the 
translation of reports into  languages other than those of the United Nations were available 
in order to raise awareness at the domestic level. The lack of translation of documents for 
the current annual meeting was noted with regret. <b> </b></p>


<p><b> VII.  Consultations with human rights mechanisms, States and others 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Joint meeting with human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>26. The joint meeting with the twelfth inter-committee meeting focused on good 
practices in cooperation between the treaty bodies and the special procedures, and 
welcomed the compilation of good practices on cooperation between the two mechanisms 
prepared by OHCHR at the request of participants in the 2010 joint meeting. The discussion 
was informed by examples of cooperation identified in the report; additional positive 
examples of cooperation were shared and further modalities were suggested to coordinate 
work on issues of common interest. 
</p>
<p>27. Participants noted that collaboration between treaty bodies and special procedures 
was extensive and had contributed to the mutual reinforcement of each mechanism&#8217;s 
recommendations. It was also noted that collaboration and coordination was essential to 
avoid divergence in the interpretation of human rights norms by special procedures and 
treaty bodies. Increased cross-referencing of recommendations, joint meetings on thematic 
issues and country situations, joint activities on follow-up to recommendations, and joint 
advocacy (for example aimed at increasing the number of ratifications of human rights 
treaties) were advocated. It was noted that special procedures, in particular country 
mandates, could contribute to the preparation by treaty bodies of consideration of States 
parties&#8217; reports through briefings and other input. 
</p>
<p>28. Several participants referred to cases where special procedures had contributed or 
were actively contributing to the development of treaty bodies&#8217; general comments and 
where treaty bodies had been engaged in the development of guiding principles supported 
by special procedures. The importance of strategic information-sharing, in particular in 
relation to thematic priorities, was identified as an area requiring further strengthening; it 
was agreed that measures, such as an exchange of work plans and the use of new 
technologies, should be adopted to facilitate cooperation. It was also suggested that 
examples of best practices in implementation relating to themes common to treaty bodies 
and mandates should be collected. Systematic and more structured exchanges and 
interactions between the two mechanisms were also regarded as crucial. 
</p>
<p>29. At the joint meeting, it was recommended that the compilation should include 
additional and recent examples of good practices, such as those highlighted by treaty body 
members and special procedures mandate holders during the joint meeting or immediately 
afterwards. It was also recommended that the consolidated document should be finalized in 
consultation with the chairs of the joint meeting, kept updated and made publicly available. 
</p>
<p>30. The provision by OHCHR over the past year of regular updates and newsletters on 
the outputs and activities of treaty bodies and special procedures was welcomed, and 
participants in the joint meeting recommended further promotion of the Universal Human 
Rights Index website and use of other new technologies to increase the availability and 
accessibility of recommendations of the treaty bodies and special procedures, as well as 
those made in the context of the universal periodic review. OHCHR was also urged to 
maintain the forecast of country visits of special procedures and to make this available to 
treaty bodies, and also to inform treaty bodies when mandate holders were available at the 
time of their sessions. 
</p>
<p>31. Recalling that it was the primary responsibility of States to follow up on and 
implement the recommendations of the human rights mechanisms, participants in the joint 
meeting noted that the political bodies, including the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council, also had a role to play in following up with States on the implementation of 
these recommendations.  </p>


<p>32. Participants reiterated points of agreement adopted at the eleventh inter-committee 
meeting and at the seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders1 and 
agreed that the next joint meeting should focus on substantive issues and specific themes to 
be agreed upon by the two Chairs prior to the meeting.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Exchange of views with States 
</b></p>
<p>33. Opening the exchange of views, the Chair of the Coordination Committee 
underlined the importance of mandate holders and of States maintaining open and 
constructive dialogue in relation to their common objectives of ensuring human rights 
protection at the national level. Appreciation was extended to the former President of the 
Human Rights Council and to the facilitator of the Council review segment on special 
procedures for allowing the Committee to contribute actively to the review process on 
behalf of mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>34. States welcomed the opportunity to meet with mandate holders and looked forward 
to enhanced interaction, emphasizing the importance of the integrity, impartiality and 
independence of special procedures. It was observed that the outcome of the Human Rights 
Council review reaffirmed these principles and the obligation of States to cooperate with 
special procedures. Mandate holders were urged to coordinate their visit requests and to 
ensure that their recommendations were practical, concrete and realistic, and took into 
account the context of the State concerned. More resources had to be provided from the 
regular budget to support special procedures, and transparency in relation to extra-
budgetary and non-United Nations resources should be the guiding principle; special 
procedures were urged to be proactive in this context. Ways to enhance interactive 
dialogues with mandate holders during the Council sessions were discussed, and more 
informal interaction with States, such as through side events and other imaginative formats, 
was encouraged, including, if possible, with States recently visited. It was noted that 
multiple visit requests and follow-up to the recommendations of special procedures 
sometimes posed a challenge for States, particularly as there were also requirements to 
follow up on the recommendations of the universal periodic review and treaty bodies. 
Harmonization and synchronization of all recommendations were encouraged, and special 
procedures were urged to provide recommendations for technical assistance and capacity-
building. It was noted that special procedures could track the implementation of treaty body 
and universal periodic review recommendations. They also had a role to play in the second 
round of the review, which would be diluted if the compilation report failed to include 
developments reported by mandate holders. States also called for improved follow-up to 
country visits; a suggestion was made that thematic reports might contain a section on this. 
Consistency across mandates in relation to communications should be an objective, and 
mandate holders were asked to strengthen efforts to verify information in respect of these 
and to take into account the constraints that some States faced in responding by deadlines.  
</p>
<p>35. Mandate holders raised concerns regarding the lack of adequate regular budgetary 
support for their work and noted that the creation of additional mandates by the Human 
Rights Council without additional and sufficient resources posed significant challenges to 
the system. While regular budgetary funding remains inadequate, mandate holders noted 
that they would continue to rely upon voluntary extra-budgetary support. There was 
agreement that transparency should apply to all such support and that it should be 
distributed among mandates as equitably as possible, taking into account their 
requirements. 
</p>
<p>36. The importance of building on the outcome of the Human Rights Council review as 
a basis for further joint efforts to strengthen the work of the Council was underlined. The 
</p>

<p>increase in the number of standing invitations by States was welcomed by special 
procedures; however, concern was expressed that some States that had issued an invitation 
had not permitted visits by mandate holders. Mandate holders and States both emphasized 
the importance of dialogue and meeting with each other to discuss cooperation and follow-
up on the basis of mutual respect.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Exchange of views with United Nations entities and field presences of 
the Office of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>37. Mandate holders exchanged views with representatives of the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the 
World Health Organization. Participants welcomed the work of United Nations entities in 
support of their activities, in particular with regard to visits. Several good practices of 
engagement and partnerships were underlined, and it was noted that United Nations entities 
helped to identify priority issues, provide information regarding the national context, 
organize meetings with stakeholders, recommend areas to visit during country missions and 
support implementation of recommendations of mandate holders by enhancing their 
incorporation into policies, programmes and strategies at the national level by means of 
sustained and coordinated advocacy and technical cooperation with States. The benefit of 
United Nations statistics, tools and guidelines to mandate holders was underlined.  
</p>
<p>38. Participants highlighted the ways in which the work of mandate holders could 
support that of United Nations entities. For example, mandate holders could alert the 
international community to issues that might be ignored, encourage States to act on 
recommendations of United Nations country teams, and provide international expert advice 
to actors at the regional, national and local levels, including through facilitating the 
participation of mandate holders in national events and by highlighting good practices from 
other countries. 
</p>
<p>39. Good practices of cooperation between United Nations entities and mandate holders 
were identified, such as joint ratification campaigns, issuing of joint press releases on 
critical situations, and individual and systemic collaboration in relation to protection 
concerns. The importance of providing members of United Nations entities and country 
teams with additional, structured awareness-raising and training on how to apply a human 
rights-based approach was noted. 
</p>
<p>40. The OHCHR Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division and 
representatives of field presences from Ecuador and the Russian Federation also provided 
input on the role, responsibilities and scope for action of different types of field presences, 
adding that the recommendations of special procedures often informed their strategies.  
</p>
<p>41. Participants discussed specific examples of collaboration with special procedures in 
all regions, and the importance of ensuring that cooperation was part of a cycle of 
engagement aimed at the promotion and protection of human rights on the ground. Regular 
consultations with mandate holders where views on priority countries and issues could be 
exchanged were considered valuable, as were the mutual support and joint action on issues 
of common concerns. OHCHR could encourage greater cooperation by States and advocate 
for acceptance of country visit requests. It could also facilitate joint action with regional 
bodies and mechanisms. In addition, special procedures had a role in the development of 
national human rights action plans and their implementation.  
</p>
<p>42. Mandate holders expressed their appreciation for the support provided by OHCHR 
at Headquarters and in the field. They emphasized the need to enhance information-sharing 
and priority-setting, and decided to continue to discuss ways of maximizing collaboration 
for greater impact, particular in the light of resource constraints. </p>


<p>43.  Participants also exchanged views with Special Rapporteur on Disability of the 
Commission on Social Development, Shuaib Chalklen, who described his mandate and 
referred to ongoing cooperation with several thematic and country-specific special 
procedures. Ways in which to enhance communication with special procedures were 
discussed, and greater interaction between the Special Rapporteur and mandate holders was 
recommended. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Exchange of views with civil society and national human rights 
institutions 
</b></p>
<p>44. Opening the exchange of views with civil society and national human rights 
institutions, the Chair of the Coordination Committee stressed the fact that mandate holders 
regarded civil society organizations and national human rights institutions as critical 
partners in their efforts to promote and protect human rights on the ground. The civil 
society organizations congratulated the Chair on her election, welcomed the new mandate 
holders, provided information on their collaboration with special procedures, made specific 
proposals on how to enhance their effectiveness and encouraged special procedures to 
dedicate more time to meeting them. It was suggested that enhanced cooperation by States 
was required, as low response rates to communications and negative responses by States, 
including those that had issued standing invitations, to visit requests were a matter of 
concern, as was the lack of resources available to special procedures. The organizations 
encouraged mandate holders to include information on cooperation with States in their 
annual reports and specific follow-up activities in their work plans. They also encouraged 
the Human Rights Council and States to take additional steps to follow up on 
implementation of recommendations. It was suggested that special procedures should 
engage strategically in the second cycle of the universal periodic review, including by using 
the preparation for the review in the country under review to issue invitations for country 
visits and to conduct follow-up. In relation to treaty bodies, the organizations commended 
the use by mandate holders of the recommendations made by treaty bodies in their 
preparation for country missions, and suggested that this should be strengthened. They also 
suggested that mandate holders should provide input into the development of Council 
resolutions, particularly those relating to the subject matter of their mandate, and to follow 
up on the implementation of them. 
</p>
<p>45. It was noted the space for civil society was shrinking in some countries, but it was 
positive that the outcome of the Human Rights Council review strongly rejected reprisals 
against persons who cooperated with human rights mechanisms. Reprisals were regarded as 
an attack on the integrity of the Council and the special procedures system, and mandate 
holders had the responsibility to follow up on cases of reprisals proactively, including by 
informing the President of the Council and the State concerned. The civil society 
organizations called for enhanced interaction of mandate holders during Council sessions 
and opportunities to provide input for thematic reports. They also encouraged mandate 
holders to obtain detailed and updated information from the organizations prior to country 
visits, and to coordinate their visit planning with each other to achieve more comprehensive 
coverage. The work of mandate holders on specific areas, such as the fight against torture, 
was welcomed and further encouraged. In particular, mandate holders were urged to 
strengthen the mainstreaming of disability issues into their work, including through the 
incorporation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and to cooperate 
with disabled persons&#8217; organizations, especially in the preparation of and during visits. The 
use of language in accordance with that of the Convention and further efforts to make 
documentation disability-accessible were also encouraged.  
</p>
<p>46. Mandate holders reiterated that civil society organizations are drivers of change, and 
encouraged human rights organizations to create coalitions beyond the traditional human 
rights mainstream for greater impact and change. They noted the challenges to the </p>


<p>recognition of economic, social and cultural rights, and emphasized the need for civil 
society organizations to enhance their communications with special procedures by 
including more detailed and reliable information. The importance of follow-up on 
communications to safeguard the safety of victims was stressed; mandate holders noted that 
they were considering further practical measures to protect individuals against reprisals. 
Civil society organizations were informed that a new joint communications report was 
being drafted to facilitate access and streamline reporting on communications, and the 
organizations were encouraged to use such reports as a basis of further advocacy and work 
with States.  
</p>
<p>47. The Chair highlighted the important role of civil society organizations in early 
warning and follow-up, and welcomed the concrete recommendations they had made. She 
encouraged non-governmental organizations working at the international level to 
disseminate information to local organizations, and to ensure that the opinions and concerns 
of the local organizations were transmitted to international human rights forums, including 
the special procedures. She emphasized the importance of social movements in accelerating 
human rights implementation, noting that they shared the objectives of human rights 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>48.  A statement delivered by the Director of the German Institute for Human Rights on 
behalf of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions outlined the 
role of national human rights institutions in preparing and supporting country visits and 
following up on recommendations of special procedures. It was suggested that the manual 
of special procedures should be enhanced through the addition of guidance on working with 
national human rights institutions, that future induction sessions for new mandate holders 
include additional information on interaction with such institutions, and that a compilation 
of best practices on cooperation between institutions and special procedures be prepared. It 
was furthermore suggested by participants that mandate holders should participate in the 
proceedings of the International Coordination Committee. </p>
