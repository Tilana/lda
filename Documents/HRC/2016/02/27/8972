<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is the fourth submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, since his appointment in 
July 2005. The report covers the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur in 2008, in 
accordance with Council resolution 8/10. 
</p>
<p> In the thematic section of the report, he focuses on the protection of children in the context 
of migration, recalling the obligation of the State to ensure the protection of all children in all 
stages of the migration process. The Special Rapporteur presents an overview of the international 
legal framework applicable, proposes a conceptual framework and refers briefly to three 
categories of children affected by the migration process: those left behind by migrating family 
members; migrant children moving across borders; and migrant children in host countries. The 
Special Rapporteur concludes the report with recommendations for further consideration and 
action by States and other stakeholders.

<b>II.  THEMATIC ISSUES:  THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 
</b></p>
<p><b>IN THE CONTEXT OF MIGRATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Migration and the international protection afforded to children 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  General background on migration and children 
</b></p>
<p>18. Children have always been part of migration and affected by it in different ways. Children 
left behind by migrant family members are affected by migration in countries of origin. Children </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on the move are affected at the pre-departure stage in countries of origin and in 
countries of transit and destination at the passage and arrival stages. Children in host 
countries are affected at the post-arrival and long-term stay and integration stages of the 
migration process. 
</p>
<p>19. Children can migrate in various ways. Children move across borders with their parents or 
are accompanied by extended family members or other adults and within mixed migratory 
flows.<b>1</b> Children are also increasingly seeking migration opportunities to move across borders 
autonomously and unaccompanied. Falling prey to transnational organized crime and 
exploitation practices including smuggling, trafficking in persons and contemporary forms of 
slavery, which are described, in some instances, as abusive forms of migration,<b>2</b> may also be a 
part of the migration experience for many children.  
</p>
<p>20. There is no accurate statistical information on the number of children involved in the 
international migration process.<b>3</b> Age is not a common variable of disaggregated statistical data 
on international migration,<b>4</b> which remains as the most difficult component of population change 
to measure.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Like adult migration, child migration is influenced by the political, social, economic and 
environmental situation. This includes new global phenomena such as climate change, the food 
crisis and the financial and economic crisis.<b>6</b> Child-specific phenomena such as child abuse and 
domestic violence may also influence the movement of children across borders.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Mixed migratory flows are defined as &#8220;complex population movements, including refugees, 
</p>
<p>asylum-seekers, economic migrants and other migrants&#8221;. See International Migration Law, 
<i>Glossary on Migration</i>, International Organization for Migration, 2004, p. 42.

</b>  See, for example, the introduction by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking 
(E/2002/68/Add.1). 
<b>3
</b>  The United Nations Global Migration Database includes data from official statistical sources, 
</p>
<p>that do not always include age as a variable for disaggregating data 
(http://esa.un.org/unmigration/). 
<b>4
</b>  Information available at the World Migrant Stock database includes five variables; age was not 
</p>
<p>included among them. See World Migrant Stock: the 2005 Revision Population Database, 
available at http://esa.un.org/migration/.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. Migration potentially enhances the child&#8217;s opportunities and future choices.<b>7</b> However, 
many forms of migration, like the treatment of children during the migration process, can also 
pose serious threats to the child&#8217;s rights. Evidence suggests, for example, that the potential 
benefits of migration may be eroded for both undocumented children and children with an 
irregular migration status,<b>8</b> who are exposed to the denial of rights, such as arbitrary deprivation 
of liberty and limited or no access to health-care services and education.  
</p>
<p>23. Children who are unaccompanied<b>9</b> or separated from their parents<b>10</b> are particularly 
vulnerable to human rights violations and abuses at all stages of the migration process. Some 
special procedures have documented, for example, that unaccompanied children looking for 
asylum are often at risk of deportation without access to the protection measures to which they 
are entitled. They have also documented that unaccompanied children, especially the most 
vulnerable categories such as victims of sale of children or trafficking in persons, are often 
treated like adult irregular migrants (E/CN.4/1999/71).  
</p>
<p>24. The lack of distinction between adult and child migrants is therefore a major challenge that 
a number of States still have to overcome. National migration laws do not always include a child 
rights perspective and usually lack specific provisions on children. Additionally, most public 
policies on children do not yet include the specific needs and protection to be afforded to the 
child in the context of migration. The treatment of migrant children as adults may lead to 
harmful practices, for example, when irregular migration is criminalized (A/HRC/7/12), or when 
deportation and detention procedures do not comply with the protection that should be given to 
children in those circumstances.  
</p>
<p>25. The protection of the child during migration demands the consideration of issues related to 
irregular migration, since they may affect the child&#8217;s enjoyment of human rights. For example, 
the criminalization of irregular migration addressed by the Special Rapporteur in a previous 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  For an in-depth study of the positive impact of migration on human development, see <i>Human 
</i></p>
<p><i>Development on the Move</i>, Human Development Report, United Nations Development 
Programme (forthcoming in September 2009). 
<b>8
</b>  Irregular migration remains as low as 10 to 15 per cent of the global international migration 
</p>
<p>stock. See <i>Towards a Fair Deal for Migrant Workers in the Global Economy</i>, Report VI, 
International Labour Organization, 2004, para. 37.  
<b>9
</b>  Children referred to as &#8220;unaccompanied&#8221; are those separated from parents or other relatives, or 
</p>
<p>as not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so. See 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 6 on treatment of unaccompanied 
and separated children outside their country of origin (HRI/GEN/1/Rev.8), para 7.  
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  Children referred as &#8220;separated&#8221; are those that may be accompanied by adult family members 
or caregivers. See Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 6, para. 8. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>report (A/HRC/7/12) has proven to be at the origin of ill-treatment and other human rights 
abuses. This is of particular concern in the case of children, especially those unaccompanied and 
undocumented, in countries of transit and destination where irregular migration is sanctioned 
with imprisonment, particularly when migration management policies are yet to mainstream a 
child rights approach. 
</p>
<p>26. The protection of children during migration necessarily implies a gender dimension, since 
women and girls account for almost 50 per cent of international migrant stock.<b>11</b> The need to take 
into consideration the special vulnerability of the girl child to gender-based violence and 
discrimination<b>12</b> is illustrated, inter alia, by the impact that additional restrictions on travel owing 
to male guardianships may have on the number of girls resorting to irregular channels to migrate. 
The gender dimension of migration also includes issues of trafficking in persons for purposes of 
sexual exploitation, forced labour and other forms of exploitation,<b>13</b> as well as other abuses to 
which the girl child is more vulnerable during migration, such as the request of sexual favours in 
exchange for protection or for the promise to cross borders.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>27. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur deems it important that a discussion on the 
protection of children in the context of migration be held. In the present report, he refers to the 
international legal framework applicable to children in the context of transnational human 
mobility, reminding States of their obligation to ensure the protection of all children at all stages 
of the migration process.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur also highlights some of the specific vulnerabilities of children, 
especially of unaccompanied or separated children, in the migration process, and presents an 
overview of some of the issues affecting the realization of the human rights of the child in the 
context of migration.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  International legal framework and responsibility of the State 
</b></p>
<p>29. Existing international human rights instruments are aimed at protecting the rights of all 
human beings, including children. The rights of the child are also recognized in several

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties<b>15</b> including the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which contains several provisions on the 
rights of children of migrant workers.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>30. The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most comprehensive legal instrument on 
the protection of the child, enshrining a set of universal rights that constitute the minimum 
standards that States must ensure for every child under their jurisdiction, without discrimination 
of any kind, including, but not limited to, on the grounds of age, sex, nationality, migration or 
stateless status of the child, his or her parents or legal guardians (art. 2.1).  
</p>
<p>31. In article 1, the Convention defines a child as &#8220;every human being below the age 
of 18 years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier&#8221;. Although 
the Convention neither focuses on child migration nor defines the migrant child, its provisions 
are of the highest relevance to ensure the adequate protection of all children in all circumstances, 
including therefore all stages of the migration process.   
</p>
<p>32. States parties to the Convention must ensure that its provisions and principles are fully 
reflected and given legal effect in relevant domestic legislation (art. 4).<b>17</b> States parties are also to 
be guided, in all its actions concerning children, by the overarching principles of 
non-discrimination (art. 2), the best interests of the child (art. 3), the right to life, survival and 
development (art. 6) and the rights of the child to express his or her views in all matters affecting 
him or her and to have them taken into account (art. 12 and general comment No. 5). 
</p>
<p>33. The international legal framework also recognizes the particular vulnerability of certain 
categories of children affected by migration, such as unaccompanied or separated children, as 
well as child victims of transnational organized crime.   
</p>
<p>34. With regard to unaccompanied and separated children, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, in its general comment No. 6, mentions, for example, the rights of the child to a guardian 
in procedures related to border control, repatriation and deportation, and to a legal representative;

</b>  See the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 14.1, 18.4, 23.4, 24; the

the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, arts. 5 (b), 
9.2, 11.2 (c), 16.1 (d)-(f), 16.2; and the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, arts. 3 (h), 4.3, 7, 8.2 (b), 16.5, 18.2, 23.1 (b), 23.2-5; 24.2 (a), 24.3 (c), 25 (b), 
30.5 (d).

<p>  See also Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 5 on general measures 
of implementation for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, paras. 18-25, and 
general comment No. 6, para. 14.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the principle of non-refoulement, which in the case of children should be construed as including 
socio-economic conditions in countries of origin; and family reunification entitlements in 
countries of origin and destination.  
</p>
<p>35. The minimum measures that should be taken into consideration in the process of initial 
assessment once unaccompanied or separated children enter a country of transit or destination is 
also addressed in general comment No. 6; they include prioritized identification of a child as 
separated or unaccompanied immediately upon arrival at ports of entry or as soon as their 
presence in the country becomes known to the authorities including age assessment (art. 8); 
prompt age appropriate and gender sensitive registration and determination of the identity of the 
child, in a language the child understands, by professionally qualified persons; the recording of 
further information in order to meet the specific needs of the child, including the reasons for 
being separated or unaccompanied; and an assessment of particular vulnerabilities, such as 
health, physical, psychosocial, material and other protection needs, including those deriving from 
domestic violence, trafficking or trauma.   
</p>
<p>36. Children who are victims of transnational organized crime should be identified as such in 
accordance with existing international standards. Therefore, child victims should not be regarded 
as criminals or irregular migrants, but as victims entitled to appropriate assistance and measures 
of protection. Applicable legal instruments, such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the 
two protocols supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime contain similar provisions emphasizing that States parties should take appropriate 
measures to protect the rights and interests of child victims of those practices and adapt 
procedures that take into consideration their special needs and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, 
principle 1 of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.1) suggests, that children who are victims of trafficking should be 
identified as such, while principle 8 recommends that special measures be taken for their 
protection and support. 
</p>
<p>37. Additional international legal instruments may complement the general legal framework in 
specific circumstances. For example, in cases of detention of unaccompanied migrant children, 
legal instruments dealing with consular relations<b>18</b> and with human rights in the context of the 
administration of justice<b>19</b> may play an important role for the protection of the child. Maritime 
law is relevant in cases of the interception and rescue of migrant children at sea,<b>20</b> and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  See for example the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, art. 36, para. 1 (b).  
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  See for example the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of Their 
</p>
<p>Liberty, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice 
and the Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System.  
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  See for example the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, art. 98.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law is to be considered in, for example, the case of children under 
15 years of age, orphaned or separated from their families as a result of international armed 
conflicts.<b>21</b> This is also the case of provisions on contemporary forms of slavery<b>22</b> and 
international labour standards on child labour and forced labour.<b>23</b>  
</p>
<p>38. Treaty bodies have issued general recommendations providing guidance to ensure the 
respect of human rights in the context of migration. This is the case of the two general 
recommendations on non-citizens issued by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination,<b>24</b> general recommendation No. 26 on women migrant workers issued by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the general comment on 
the position of aliens under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights issued by the 
Human Rights Committee.<b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>39. The international legal framework applicable to the protection of children in the context of 
migration is complemented by a number of resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. Special mention should be made 
of Council resolution 9/5, in which the Council expressly recognizes the vulnerability of migrant 
children and calls upon States to protect the human rights of migrant children, particularly 
unaccompanied children, ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration 
in their policies of integration, return and family reunification. 
</p>
<p>40. In their resolutions on the protection of migrants, the General Assembly and the Council 
call upon States to promote and protect effectively the human rights of all migrants, regardless of 
their migration status, especially those of women and children, and highlight specific concerns 
related to their protection. For example, the Assembly, in its resolutions 62/157 and 63/184, and 
the Council in its resolution 9/5, urge States to ensure that repatriation mechanisms allow for the 
identification and special protection of persons in vulnerable situations and take into account, in 
conformity with their international obligations and commitments, the principle of the best 
interest of the child and family reunification. Furthermore, the obligation of the State to respect 
the human rights of the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and children, 
who place themselves in a vulnerable situation by attempting to cross international borders 
without the required travel documents, is recognized by the Assembly in its resolutions 63/184 
and 62/157 and the Council in its resolution 9/5.

<p>41. The international legal framework for the protection of the child applies irrespective of the 
migration status of the child or his or her parents or family members. Notwithstanding the State&#8217;s 
prerogative to determine the conditions of entry and stay of non-nationals on its territory and to 
sanction violations to its migration laws and regulations, no human being under the jurisdiction 
of a State should be devoid of protection; the State has the obligation to respect human rights 
during its engagement with children affected by migration, regardless of their or their parents&#8217; 
migration status.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Protection gaps 
</b></p>
<p>42. Most migration laws do not adopt a children&#8217;s rights perspective, nor do they have specific 
provisions on children. This issue should be addressed in part by harmonizing migration law 
with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international and regional 
human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>43. For instance, in cases of deportation and detention, children suffer the same consequences 
(and receive the same treatment) as adults, which often results in the deprivation of children&#8217;s 
rights. For that reason, public policies and programmes should ensure the protection of children 
from detention and deportation, and migration laws should include concrete regulations to fulfil 
children&#8217;s rights and needs in such circumstances. In particular, these laws should include such 
children&#8217;s rights principles as detention as a last resort; priority and alternative measures to 
detention; and prohibition of deportation of unaccompanied children as a punishment for 
irregular migration status. Additionally, States should only repatriate children as a measure of 
protection, for instance, to ensure family reunification (in cases where it is in the child&#8217;s best 
interests) and due process of law, including their right to be heard and their right to a guardian 
and a legal representative. A children&#8217;s rights perspective in migration law and policies, together 
with the rights-based approach, would therefore ensure both that the particular needs and rights 
of children be expressly included (the principle of &#8220;childhood integral protection&#8221; should be fully 
incorporated in migration law and policies) and that all human rights will be recognized for all 
migrant children, irrespective of age, sex, nationality or migration status.  
</p>
<p>44. The second general gap concerns public policies aimed at children. In many countries, 
policies meant for the protection of the rights of the child (most of them based in the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child) have not yet taken into account the specific conditions and needs of 
migrant children (in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, civil society has 
highlighted the government expression &#8220;Every child matters&#8221;, in order to advocate for the 
inclusion of child migrants in public policies on childhood). This gap is evident in policies 
concerning, inter alia, education (such as access, dropping out and language barriers), health 
care, birth registration, adolescent professional training and commercial exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Children in the migration process 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Children left behind 
</b></p>
<p>45. The term &#8220;children left behind&#8221; refers to children raised in their home countries or in their 
countries of habitual residence who have been left behind by adult migrants responsible for 
them, such as one or both parents, extended family members, legal guardians or caregivers. 
Children left behind may be actually better off in their new circumstances, such as in the case of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>those benefiting from remittances allowing them greater access to health care and education. 
However, children left behind may also be neglected, as in the case of those raised without any 
type of parental care or guidance, abandoned by migrating parents or extended family members 
and with no or limited access to social services. 
</p>
<p>46. The impact of migration on children left behind is difficult to measure.<b>25</b> Many factors may 
play a role in assessing how migration may affect the rights of children left behind.<b>26</b> For 
example, some studies indicate that remittances help to reduce the overall level of poverty and 
promote economic development in countries of origin,<b>27</b> while others suggest that parental 
absence creates new challenges, including family instability, a greater burden on the household 
and social stigmatization.<b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>47. Children left behind might also be at greater risk of psychosocial trauma, violent 
behaviour, drug abuse and teenage pregnancy.<b>27</b> Previous findings by the mandate also indicate 
instances when children left behind were obliged to take on huge tasks inappropriate to their age 
and were subject to physical, psychological and sexual abuse by relatives or neighbours to whom 
they were entrusted during their parents&#8217; absence (E/CN.4/2002/94/Add.1). Instances where 
households endured increased economic and psychological vulnerabilities such as families left 
behind, sometimes weighed down by debt, exploited by moneylenders and exposed to pressure 
and control from relatives because of their dependency on remittances have also been 
documented by the Special Rapporteur in some of his country visits.  
</p>
<p>48. Social policies in countries of origin or residence - for example, the kind of social support 
available for the protection of children and the specific living situation of the child in his or her 
country of origin or residence (whether the child has access to education, shelter, health care and

<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  The role of remittances has been a significant focus of studies by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development 
(IFAD) and the World Bank. See for example R. Vargas-Lundius, G. Lanly, M. Villareal and 
M. Osorio, <i>International migration, remittances and rural development</i>, IFAD-FAO, 2008 and

<p>sanitation), and whether the State protects the child against the many hazards and dangers 
including those posed by national and transnational organized crime, intermediaries, employers, 
or working conditions - are a key factor in determining the impact of migration on children left 
behind.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>49. The attention of the Special Rapporteur has been drawn to the migration of health 
professionals as a serious impediment to the delivery of health-care services to the population in 
communities characterized by high levels of migration. This has also affected the provision of 
health-care services to children in some countries of origin.<b>30</b> In this connection, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts made by some host countries to transform migration 
challenges for countries of origin into opportunities for cooperation. A good example is the pilot 
project &#8220;Migration and Development for Africa&#8221;, launched by the International Organization for 
Migration (Helsinki) with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland, which 
promotes the return of qualified professionals of Somali background on a temporary basis to 
Somaliland and Puntland to assist and share their skills with local health authorities, civil society 
organizations, hospitals and universities.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>50. Assessing the human rights impact of migration on children left behind also includes a 
gender dimension that requires careful consideration by the State. Research studies carried out in 
the Latin American region, suggest, for example, that children left behind may be affected 
differently by the absence of their mother compared to the father, given that when a family 
member migrates, relations are redefined and subsequent changes in roles and responsibilities 
affect the daily life of the child. Furthermore, studies by the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) in Tajikistan suggest that the prolonged absence of the male head of the household often 
leaves the rest of the family destitute.<b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>51. The inclusion of measures to promote family unity and facilitate the reunion of children 
with their parents in host countries is also necessary to address adequately the special needs and 
protection of children left behind. Many parents and other family members initially migrate

<p>without children, but subsequently plan to bring them to a host country. Therefore, it is important 
that States of origin develop policies and strengthen bilateral, regional and international 
cooperation to reduce the number of unaccompanied children seeking to join their parents or 
other family members in host countries through regular channels.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Children on the move 
</b></p>
<p>52. Children on the move are migrant children taking an active part in the migration process, 
particularly at the passage and arrival stages in countries of transit and destination. They may be 
found, inter alia, migrating with their family members or independently, to seek opportunities at 
both the educational and employment levels. They may also be found entering host countries to 
rejoin migrant members of the family, being relocated or sent by families to stay with relatives or 
friends in third countries or, as the Special Rapporteur has documented, sent by 
family members to find work abroad and send part of their earnings home 
(E/CN.4/2005/85/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>53. Children may also be forcibly on the move, such as when falling prey to transnational 
organized crime and exploitation networks. The Special Rapporteur has received reports about 
growing numbers of trafficked children,<b>33</b> which in some instances is a consequence of 
oppressive or abusive home conditions, poverty or the absence of economic opportunities in the 
home region.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>54. Unaccompanied and separated children on the move may face greater vulnerabilities and 
risks<b>35</b> including discrimination, sexual and other forms of violence, and being coerced into 
begging, drug dealing or prostitution by criminals or criminal organizations 
(E/CN.4/2005/85/Add.3).

World Health Organization (WHO), large numbers of migrants die each year while being 
smuggled by land or sea, and smuggled migrants on the move may face hardships, including 
starvation and psychologically challenging circumstances. See Helena Nygren-Krug, 
&#8220;International Migration, Health and Human Rights&#8221;,<i> Health and Human Rights Publication 
Series</i>, No. 4, WHO, 2003. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>55. Frequent human rights issues affecting children on the move also include deportation and 
repatriation. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw the attention of States to the numerous 
allegations he has received of cases of children being expelled at international borders, thus 
endangering their well-being and physical integrity (E/CN.4/2002/94 and Add.1).  
</p>
<p>56. With regard to the deportation of children of migrants and the importance of respecting the 
best interests of the child in such procedures, the Special Rapporteur believes that the concerns 
set out below should be borne in mind. 
</p>
<p>57. Consideration could be given to the principle of non-deportation of unaccompanied 
children, whereby children should be repatriated only if it is in their best interest, namely, for the 
purpose of family reunification and after due process of law. The enforcement of this principle 
would require public policies and a legal framework in both countries. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the recently adopted European Union directive on return (2008/115/EC) 
authorizes the deportation of children migrants in the same sense as adults (art. 10), despite some 
specific protection measures. No distinction is made on the nature of the deportation, which in 
both cases is a &#8220;punitive approach&#8221; instead of a &#8220;protection approach&#8221;, as stressed by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child<b>36</b> and other human rights institutions.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p>58. The possibility of reunification in the country of destination, as suggested by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child in its general comment No. 6 (paras. 81-90) could also be 
considered. Furthermore, it might be mentioned expressly that, within these procedures, States 
should fulfil &#8220;age appropriate&#8221; due process of law, including, inter alia, rights to a guardian, a 
legal representative, free legal aid, access to jurisdiction, effective remedy, an interpreter if 
necessary and to be heard. 
</p>
<p>59. Mechanisms are also needed to ensure children&#8217;s rights and perspectives within the 
deportation procedures of their parents (based on their migration status), especially their right to 
be heard. While States tend to consider the rights of the adults involved in these procedures 
(including the right to the family unit), there is no specific mechanism that considers the rights of 
their children. 
</p>
<p>60. Another major concern of the Special Rapporteur with regard to children on the move 
relates to the particular vulnerability of children who are unaccompanied, undocumented and/or 
entering countries irregularly, including within mixed migratory flows, to unlawful or arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty.<b>38</b> The Committee on the Rights of the Child has asserted that

 <p> 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied children should not be detained because of migration-related conditions; States 
should therefore include alternative measures to detention and express the priority of these 
measures in their legislation. Subsequently, States should develop public policies which ensure 
the effective enforcement of these alternative measures by competent authorities, both 
administrative and judicial. 
</p><p>61. Any detention order should justify the reasons for not applying alternative measures, and 
the place of detention should be chosen for the child&#8217;s integral protection; they should not be 
detained in prisons or with adults. Child protection approaches should be at the core of the goals 
and functions of detention institutions/centres, and include the realization of such rights as 
education, health care, recreation, consular assistance, guardian protection and legal 
representation, among others. Furthermore, detention centres should be managed by childhood 
protection officers who have received training on children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>62. Migration-related detention of children should not be justified on the basis of maintaining 
the family unit (for example, detention of children with their parents when all are irregular 
migrants). As UNICEF and other experts have stressed, detention of children will never be in 
their best interests.<b>39</b> Hence, the ideal utilization of a rights-based approach would imply 
adopting alternative measures for the entire family; States should therefore develop policies for 
placing the entire family in alternative locations to closed detention centres. 
</p>
<p>63. Some countries make distinctions among children (for instance, children above 12 years of 
age) with regard to detention policy. In such cases, children over 12 years of age are detained 
in detention centres, while those under 12 are placed in protection centres for 
children. Such a practice should be considered an unlawful interpretation of article 1 of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Furthermore, adolescents should not be treated as 
adults.  
</p>
<p>64. A number of countries still consider the breach of migration law a criminal offence (for 
example, in cases of irregular entry, lack of residence permit, using an expired residence 
authorization or unauthorized re-entry after a deportation and re-entry prohibition decision). 
Furthermore, since in most countries migration laws lack a children&#8217;s rights perspective, the 
criminalization of irregular migration applies also to children. 
</p>
<p>65. For this reason, it is important to stress that the criminalization of irregular migration leads 
to human rights violations and to recall the recommendations made by several human rights

transit centres and transit zones), with a particular focus on provisions and facilities for persons

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mechanisms,<b>40</b> and international declarations<b>41</b> on this issue. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur 
suggests that States that still punish irregular migration with imprisonment should revise and 
reform their migration laws, de-criminalize irregular migration and provide special protection for 
unaccompanied and accompanied migrant children.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Protecting children in host countries 
</b></p>
<p>66. The protection of children in host countries is in most circumstances context specific, and 
therefore depends on the particular situation of the child: whether the child&#8217;s situation amounts 
to the protection afforded under refugee law; whether the child is a victim of transnational 
organized crime; whether the child is migrating with his family and one or both parents are 
migrant workers; or whether the child is migrating irregularly, unaccompanied or undocumented. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur has identified two areas where States generally should enhance 
efforts to provide rights-based responses to protect children in host countries. The first area 
relates to the general protection of children affected by transnational organized crime. The 
second area relates to the full enjoyment of human rights by children from a migrant 
background.  
</p>
<p>68. The first area covers grey areas of the general protection of the child affected by 
transnational organized crime. For example, the classification of a child as a trafficking victim 
implies in some instances additional migration obstacles for the child at the border or forced 
return to his or her place of origin, without taking into consideration the child&#8217;s view on their 
return to the country of origin, in proportion to age and maturity.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the criminalization of traffickers is sometimes 
construed in a way that undermines or diminishes the child&#8217;s rights, for example, when affording 
protection to a child victim is conditional on the child&#8217;s agreement to testify against the 
traffickers in court.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the situation of children born and living in 
countries where their mothers have been trafficked, particularly when there is a well-founded 
fear of reprisals against them by traffickers and when children are left behind because their

</p>
<p>trafficked mothers are in police custody or detention centres as a result of police or immigration 
raids, as highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography (A/HRC/7/8).  
</p>
<p>71. The second area in which States need to enhance protection concerns children from a 
migrant background. Children in this category do not necessarily fall into the definition of 
migrant children, but they are affected by the immigration background of their parents or family 
members. Evidence suggests that States should enhance their efforts to address, from a 
rights-based perspective, a number of issues affecting children falling into this category; for 
example, the European Commission found that factors lying behind discrimination in education 
may apply to subsequent generations of migrants, including in some instances those already 
naturalized.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>72. The protection of migrant children in host countries has been addressed by the Special 
Rapporteur in his communications<b>44</b> and country visits,<b>45</b> in which he identified irregular 
migration and its criminalization as situations causing him deep concern in relation to the 
effective protection of migrant children. When criminalized, irregular migration has proven to be 
a deterrent, for example, for the child&#8217;s birth registration, because irregular or undocumented 
migrants usually fear imprisonment and/or deportation and therefore try to avoid all contact with 
local authorities.<b>46</b> Barriers to birth registration and/or its denial have serious consequences for 
the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to be recognized as a person before the law.<b>47</b> 
Furthermore, the State should prevent situations of statelessness.<b>48</b>

<p>  No specific information is available on the number of children who may be unregistered for 
reasons associated with the migration status of their parents, extended family members, legal 
guardians or caregivers. UNICEF has estimated that approximately 48 million child births are 
unrecorded each year. See &#8220;The rights&#8217; start to life: A statistical analysis of birth registration&#8221;, 
UNICEF, 2005. 
<b>47
</b></p>
<p>  In the case of <i>The Yean and Bosico children v. Dominican Republic</i>, the Inter-American Court 
of Human Rights, in a judgement of 8 September 2005, referred, inter alia, to the State obligation 
to guarantee the right of the child to birth registration, which may under certain circumstances 
include non-national children. 
<b>48
</b></p>
<p>  See Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, art. 1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight that the general barriers to health-care services 
and education, particularly in the case of low-skilled and irregular migrants and their children, 
are often dependent on social inclusion (A/58/153/Rev.1). In most instances, access barriers may 
be economic, social and cultural and relate to discrimination, language obstacles and legal 
status.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>74. In past years, the Special Rapporteur was informed of cases of migrant children with an 
irregular migration background who were devoid of protection and access to education, living in 
shacks or abandoned buildings in extremely poor sanitary conditions (E/CN.4/2005/85/Add.3), 
and observed the progress made in the protection of migrant children, particularly in relation to 
the extension of health coverage and care services, regardless of the immigration status of those 
concerned. A good practice documented by the Special Rapporteur on the right to health was the 
case of Sweden, where undocumented children receive health-care assistance on the same basis 
as resident children (A/HRC/4/28/Add.2). Some States have also prohibited the denial of 
health-care services on the grounds of irregular migration status; such is the case in Uruguay 
(law 18.250, art. 9) and Argentina (law 25.871, art. 7). 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur invites States to apply their immigration laws, in line with the 
protection of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society<b>50</b> and the most 
favourable environment for the full and harmonious development of the child personality,<b>51</b> 
unless they deem it not appropriate to do so in the child&#8217;s best interests.<b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw the attention of States to the need to adopt a 
comprehensive rights-based approach to the management of migration, since migration policies 
may have a direct impact on the enjoyment of human rights by children. Policies excluding legal 
avenues for the regularization of irregular migrants and that prohibit the access of irregular 
(adult) migrants to employment may also have an impact on the standard of living of children; 
migration policies should therefore take into consideration the impact that they may have on the 
enjoyment of human rights by migrants. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
highlight that regularization policies constitute a good example of practices aimed at 
strengthening social integration and cohesion, ensure the human rights of migrants and attain 
State goals such as social security, public health coverage and social inclusion. Regularization

<p>measures should benefit unaccompanied children and children with their families and should 
have the necessary flexibility to improve the social integration of migrants, as well as provide 
access to fundamental rights, including the right to seek and obtain employment.  
</p>
<p>77. In discharging his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has come across other initiatives, 
activities and policies implemented by Governments that reflect the commitment of host 
countries to the realization of the rights of the child in the context of migration. Some examples 
of good practices aimed at ensuring the realization of the right to education of the migrant child 
are given below.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the attention devoted by some States, including 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, to early childhood 
services aiming at developing children&#8217;s capacities in general while also addressing specific 
issues, such as the language skills of children who have little opportunity to speak the local 
language in their families or neighbourhoods.<b>53</b> Although common services and facilities for all 
children should be the guiding principle, the Special Rapporteur commends the efforts made by a 
number of OECD countries to include migrant children and children from a migration 
background in support programmes aimed at fostering both their linguistic development and 
cultural integration in host countries<b>54</b> and encourages States, especially host countries, to 
continue their efforts to integrate migrant children and children from a migrant background and 
their families in these or similar programmes. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the efforts of host countries to improve equality in 
access to education for migrant children. This is the case of a number of OECD countries, such 
as in Japan, where migrant children, regardless of their immigration status, are allowed to enrol 
in public schools free of charge (A/HRC/11/7/Add.1). This is also the case of Uruguay 
(law 18.250, art. 11) and Argentina (law 25.871, art. 8).  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur also commends host countries, especially those belonging to the 
European Communities, for their efforts to build intercultural and teaching skills to favour the 
inclusion of migrant families and their children, regardless of their migration status.<b>55</b> The 
Special Rapporteur furthermore praises the efforts made to accommodate linguistic and religious 
diversity and cultural perspectives in education plans and programmes<b>55</b> and welcomes bilateral

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of an adequate legal framework 
for the protection of the rights of all children in the context of migration, including through 
ratification of relevant international human rights and other instruments and their 
translation into national laws and policies, and wishes to make a number of 
recommendations for further consideration and action. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mainstreaming a child rights-approach to migration into national plans, programmes and 
policies 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>All policies and programmes aimed at addressing the situation of children in the 
context of migration should have a human rights-based approach and be based on 
fundamental principles, such as the best interest of the child, non-discrimination and the 
right of the child to be heard in all decisions that concern him or her. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>States are encouraged to consider the impact of migration on children in the 
elaboration and implementation of national development frameworks, poverty reduction 
strategies, human rights plans of action,56 programmes and strategies for human rights 
education and the advancement of the rights of the child. States are also encouraged to 
adopt and develop programmes and policies to address significant gaps remaining in social 
policies and other areas where the protection of the migrant child is yet to be 
mainstreamed.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Protecting the most vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Effective protection of the human rights of the child should be ensured in States of 
origin, transit and destination at every stage of the migration process and in all migration 
management procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>States, especially those of transit and destination, should devote special attention to 
the protection of undocumented, unaccompanied and separated children, as well as to the 
protection of children seeking asylum and children victims of transnational organized 
crime, including trafficking in persons, smuggling, sale of children, child pornography and 
child prostitution.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>States should also consider the specific vulnerability of the migrant girl child and the 
gender impact of migration and human rights implications for girls and boys of any 
migration-related planned action, including legislation, policies and programmes, and 
address existing gaps in protection. 
</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>87.<b> Migration policies, programmes and bilateral agreements should preserve family 
unity, including by facilitating family reunification and interaction among family members. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information-sharing, data and analysis  
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> States should strengthen efforts to collect data and measure the impact of migration 
on children in countries of origin, transit and destination, with due regard for the 
opportunities and challenges for children in all stages of the migration process.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> States are especially encouraged to share across boundaries and regions information 
about key indicators of the impact of migration on children, as well as common challenges 
and best practices to address migrant children protection-related gaps at all levels. It is also 
important that stakeholders contribute to make available statistical and substantive 
information on, inter alia, the root causes of migration of children and adolescents (with 
family members or unaccompanied), to help States to identify policy gaps. 
Protecting children left behind in countries of origin 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the situation of children staying behind in 
countries of origin be included in the agenda of international debates and forums on 
migration issues and that all relevant actors undertake further studies to better understand 
the impact of migration processes on the well-being and enjoyment of human rights of the 
children left behind in countries of origin. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends the compilation and sharing of best practices in 
addressing the situation of children left behind in countries of origin, especially in the area 
of education. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> States should develop public policies to address the situation of children left behind in 
countries of origin, taking into account the best interest of the child as a guiding principle 
and ensuring the participation of these children in the design and implementation of those 
policies.  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages States to develop public policies to prevent the 
irregular migration of children and undertake public information campaigns in 
communities of origin to alert them to the dangers of irregular migration and to inform 
them of the existing protection mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protecting children on the move  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the collection of data at the national level and the 
preparation of studies and research on unaccompanied or separated children. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> States should recognize that general comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child on the treatment of unaccompanied and separated children provides useful 
guidance for the protection of the rights of unaccompanied migrant children.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> States should recognize that migrant children, especially those unaccompanied, are 
most exposed to the worst forms of child labour and, in this context, recalls the relevance of </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>the ILO Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination 
of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (Convention No. 182) and relevant Recommendation 
No. 190 and their implementation framework.  
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the conclusion of bilateral and multilateral 
agreements based on existing international human rights norms and standards and 
increased cooperation at the regional level to protect migrant children, especially those 
unaccompanied, including in matters of safe repatriation, the fight against trafficking, 
sexual exploitation and smuggling and assistance to victims. The Special Rapporteur also 
encourages consular services to continue ensuring respect for the rights of the child in the 
context of return of migrant children. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the establishment and implementation of 
institutionalized services and programmes to provide comprehensive support and 
protection to migrant children, especially those unaccompanied, including means to detect 
those who are in need of international protection. Protection services should include access 
to food, health, legal advice; support for return to the community of origin; professional 
and vocational training; and the search for durable solutions in the case of refugee 
children.  
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that protection programmes include 
reproductive sexual health awareness and training to address psychological trauma.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the design and implementation of programmes 
for the sustainable return and reintegration of children, including alternatives to return on 
the basis of the best interest of the child.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends the development of standardized procedures to 
ensure access to asylum procedures for unaccompanied migrant children who cannot 
return to their countries of origin because their life, safety or freedom are at risk, and to 
ensure an assessment of the situation in the country of origin or habitual residence of the 
children before deciding on their repatriation. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that migration officials be trained, including on 
the rights of the child and cultural sensitivities. States should ensure that age-assessment 
processes comply with international standards and that the persons concerned are allowed 
access to effective remedies to challenge age-assessment decisions. States should also 
consider according the benefit of the doubt in age-determination procedures.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Protecting children deprived of liberty because of their migratory status or that of their 
parents 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> States should recognize the need to comply with and implement the provisions 
contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and all relevant human rights 
instruments. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>104.<b> States should recognize that all practices and norms implying a restriction or a 
deprivation of liberty of children in the context of migration must respect minimum 
standards as defined in international human rights instruments. 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls that, as provided in article 37 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, detention of children should be a measure of last resort and should 
only be taken for the shortest period of time possible. He also recalls that deprivation of 
liberty of children in the context of migration should never have a punitive nature. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The Special Rapporteur furthermore recalls that migrants should not be deprived of 
liberty as a sole consequence of their migratory status and that, according to general 
comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, as a general rule, 
unaccompanied migrant children should not be detained. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages States to provide alternatives to detention for the 
family group when parents are detained on the sole basis of migratory status, keeping in 
mind the necessary balance between the need to protect family unity and the best interest 
of the child. Exceptional migration-related detention of children should be done in places 
ensuring the integral protection and well-being of the child, taking due consideration for 
the fulfilment of the child&#8217;s rights to education, health care, recreation, consular assistance 
and legal representation, among others. 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> States should bear in mind that children should be kept separate from adults, or 
when housed with families, they should have accommodation distinct from other adults. 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls that the causes and circumstances leading to the 
deprivation of liberty of migrant children should be previously defined by law and provide 
for adequate and effective remedies, including judicial review, in order to avoid arbitrary 
detention and guarantee access to legal services. 
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends the development of alternatives to deprivation 
of liberty, such as sheltered housing and alternative care with national child protection 
services. 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls that irregular migration should not be criminalized 
and migrants, especially children, should not be detained in penitentiaries or facilities for 
criminal detention, and they should have, inter alia, the right to legal advice, an 
interpreter, legal review, to have contact with the external world as well as access to 
education and health services. 
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages States to define the regime to be applied in the 
case of migrants with premises, to avoid arbitrariness and the application of a penitentiary 
regime. 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> States should recognize the need to allow independent scrutiny and control 
mechanisms of the conditions of detention of children (judicial authorities, international </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>and local non-governmental organizations, international human rights mechanisms, 
consular services), and recognize the role played by civil society and local communities in 
addressing this and other issues concerning the protection of migrant children.  
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> States should recognize the important role played by consular offices in the protection 
of migrant children, and those offices should share good practices and strengthen 
cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> States should pay special attention to the training of officials working with separated 
and unaccompanied children and dealing with their cases. States should ensure that all 
immigration officials in contact with children are aware of the principles and provisions of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</b></p>
<p>116.<b> States should recognize the need to allocate sufficient resources, including budgetary 
resources, to institutions and programmes working with migrant children deprived of their 
liberty. 
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> State authorities should ensure that private companies in charge of managing 
detention facilities act in conformity with international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protecting children in countries of destination 
</b></p>
<p>118<b> States should protect and respect the human rights of migrant children, irrespective 
of their migration status, including the rights to basic social services for all children, in 
particular the rights to food, health, education and an adequate standard of living, as well 
as access to justice. Dialogue and cooperation between Governments of States of origin and 
those of destination is highly encouraged, to ensure the fulfilment of these rights. 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends the development of strategies to pay special 
attention to migrant children in order to guarantee their access, on an equal basis and 
regardless of legal status, to the same rights as those of children nationals of the country 
concerned. 
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages States to take effective measures to guarantee the 
birth registration of children born outside their parents&#8217; country of origin and to uphold 
the principle of avoiding statelessness, and highlights the importance of harmonizing 
migration policies with public policies concerning childhood, adolescence and the family. 
</b></p>
<p>121.<b> States should recognize the importance of strengthening institutes for the protection 
of children and adolescents, including by increasing their budgets. 
</b></p>
<p>122.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that Governments in countries of transit and 
destination encourage greater harmony, tolerance and respect among migrants, 
asylum-seekers, refugees and the rest of society, with a view to eliminating acts of racism, 
xenophobia and other forms of related intolerance directed against migrants. States that 
have not eliminated the general barriers to the enjoyment of human rights by migrant 
children and their families, especially those encountered by children who are 
undocumented or have an irregular status, should do so.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>123.<b> States should base any decision to return a child or its parents to the country of origin 
on the best interests of the child, including the right to family unity.  
</b></p>
<p>124.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that inter-institutional and intersectoral 
coordination in all countries be strengthened with a view to protecting children from all 
forms of exploitation, including commercial sexual exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p>125.<b> States should recognize the need to protect child victims of transnational organized 
crime, including trafficking, as well as of violence and traumas related to migration, 
through the implementation of standards that guarantee their protection and access to 
medical, psychosocial and legal assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>126.<b> States should also promote regularization programmes with a view to preventing 
human rights violations and abuses associated with irregular migration, and take into 
consideration the fact that regular migration status facilitates the integration of migrant 
children in the communities of destination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Strengthening partnerships and international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>127.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages special procedures and treaty bodies, especially 
the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families to continue to pay special attention to the rights of migrant children. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the synergy of capacities and mandates of international 
organizations as a key element in supporting States to fulfil their respective obligations 
under international instruments. To the extent possible and when appropriate, 
policymaking discussions on migration should be built upon existing international policy 
platforms, composed by Member States, key institutions and civil society organizations 
with relevant mandates and competencies. 
</b></p>
<p>128.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages inter-institutional coordination at the national 
level, including through specific mechanisms and with the participation of civil society, 
consular services, local governments and the private sector, for the development and 
implementation of multidisciplinary policies to ensure the protection of the rights of 
children in the context of migration.
