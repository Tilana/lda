<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The programme of action for the Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s 
Indigenous Peoples highlights the importance of ensuring the effective participation of 
indigenous peoples in decision-making. One of the five objectives of the programme, as 
adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 59/174, is to promote the full and effective 
participation of indigenous peoples in decisions which directly or indirectly affect their 
lifestyles, traditional lands and territories, their cultural integrity as indigenous peoples with 
collective rights, or any other aspects of their lives, considering the principle of free, prior 
and informed consent (A/60/270, paragraph 9 (ii)).  In October 2009, the Human Rights 
Council, in resolution 12/13, requested the Expert Mechanism, in accordance with its 
mandate, to carry out a study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-
making, to present a progress report to the Council at its fifteenth session, and a final study 
to the eighteenth session.  </p>
<p>2. The range of articles in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples relating to indigenous participation in decision-making highlights the importance 
of this principle for indigenous rights (see paragraph 8 below).1 Indeed, indigenous 
participation in decision-making on the full spectrum of matters that affect their lives forms 
the fundamental basis for the enjoyment of the full range of human rights. This principle is 
a corollary of a myriad of universally accepted human rights, and at its core enables 
indigenous peoples to be freely in control of their own destinies in conditions of equality. 
Without this foundational right, the human rights of indigenous peoples, both collective and 
individual, cannot be fully enjoyed. </p>
<p>3. Importantly, the Declaration distinguishes between internal and external decision-
making processes. Thus, indigenous peoples have the right to autonomy or self-government 
over their internal and local affairs (article 4), as well as the right to participate fully, if they 
so choose, in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State (article 5), and to 
participate in all decisions affecting them or their rights (articles 18 and 19). In other words, 
the Declaration affirms the right of indigenous peoples to develop and maintain their own 
decision-making institutions and authority in parallel to their right to participate in external 
decision-making processes and the political order of the State. The present report will thus 
focus on both of these areas in light of the relevant international framework.  </p>
<p>4. While the concept of &#8220;external&#8221; decision-making processes can be generally 
understood to mean both State and non-State institutions and processes affecting indigenous 
peoples, it should be noted that the Declaration refrains from defining the concept of the 
&#8220;internal and local affairs&#8221; of indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, the wording of some of the 
provisions in the Declaration appears to be conceptually linked to the right to autonomy and 
self-government, including articles 5 and 14. </p>
<p>5. The principle of participation in decision-making also has a clear relationship with 
the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination, including the right to autonomy or 
self-government, and the State obligation to consult indigenous peoples in matters that may 
affect them, based on the principle of free, prior and informed consent. These legal 
concepts form an inherent part of any discussion of the right of indigenous peoples to 
participate in decision-making, and will be considered throughout the report as important 
aspects of that right.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 Art. 3&#8211;5, 10&#8211;12, 14, 15, 17&#8211;19, 22, 23, 26&#8211;28, 30&#8211;32, 36, 38, 40 and 41. </p>


<p>6. Finally, as the right to participation applies to indigenous peoples both collectively 
and individually, and taking into account the fact that the rights specific to indigenous 
peoples are generally formulated as collective rights, the report will also focus on the 
collective right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. International human rights law refers to the right to participation in both general and 
specific forms. Participation in its general form is to take part in the conduct of public 
affairs, whereas electoral participation is a specific form of participation. The right to take 
part in public affairs is not limited to formal political institutions, as it also includes social 
activities of a public nature. Furthermore, the right to participation is characterized as an 
individual right as well as a collective right. These fundamental principles are protected 
under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: article 21 (1) affirms that everyone has 
the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen 
representatives; and article 21 (3) establishes that the will of the people should be the basis 
of the authority of government. 
</p>
<p>8. The Declaration contains more than 20 provisions affirming the right of indigenous 
peoples to participate in decision-making, articulated as, inter alia, (a) the right to self-
determination; (b) the right to autonomy or self-government; (c) the &#8220;right to participate&#8221;; 
(d) the &#8220;right to be actively involved&#8221;; (e) the duty of States to &#8220;obtain their free, prior and 
informed consent&#8221;; (f) the duty to seek &#8220;free agreement&#8221; with indigenous peoples; (g) the 
duty to &#8220;consult and cooperate&#8221; with indigenous peoples; (h) the duty to undertake 
measures &#8220;in conjunction&#8221; with indigenous peoples; and (i) the duty to pay due &#8220;respect to 
the customs&#8221; of indigenous peoples. This emphasizes that the right to participation of 
indigenous peoples is a core principle and right under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>9. The articulation of the right to the individual dimension of participation has been 
further elaborated in human rights treaty provisions, including article 25 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which establishes the rights of citizens (a) to take 
part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; (b) to 
vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections; and (c) to have equal access to public 
service. 
</p>
<p>10. In contrast to all other provisions of the Covenant, article 25 employs the notion of 
&#8220;citizen&#8221; when referring to the subjects of the right. Thus, States may require citizenship as 
a condition for exercising the rights under article 25, although the provision does not 
prevent States from extending these rights to non-citizens. However, the particular 
reference to citizenship is a fundamental legal obstacle for a large number of stateless 
indigenous individuals, as their legal status as aliens in their country of birth and residence 
restricts their ability to participate in public affairs.  
</p>
<p>11. In its general comment No. 25 (1996) on participation in public affairs and the right 
to vote, the Human Rights Committee clarified that the rights under article 25 are related to, 
but distinct from, the right of peoples to self-determination, under article 1 (1) of the 
Covenant.2 The Committee concluded that the rights covered by article 1 (1) include the 
right of peoples to freely determine their political status and to enjoy the right to choose the 
form of their constitution or government, whereas article 25 deals with the right of 
individuals to participate in those processes that constitute the conduct of public affairs. In a 
1991 case involving indigenous peoples, <i>Marshall et al. (Mikmaq people) v. Canada</i>, the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 General comment No. 25, para. 2. </p>


<p>Committee further affirmed that the right to participation under article 25 (a) includes the 
right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely-chosen 
representatives. The Committee concluded that the provision did not establish a right to 
direct representation by an indigenous group in a constitution-making process as long as the 
individual members of the group enjoyed rights of participation along with other groups.3 It 
should, however, be pointed out that more recently, the Committee has made several 
explicit references to either article 1 or to the notion of self-determination in the context of 
indigenous peoples, relevant to the right to participation of indigenous peoples.4  
</p>
<p>12. On the other hand, the right to participation relating to certain matters concerning 
internal or local affairs is evoked under article 27 of the Covenant, which protects the 
cultural rights of indigenous peoples. The Human Rights Committee observed that the 
enjoyment of those rights might require positive legal measures of protection and measures 
to ensure the effective participation of indigenous communities in decisions affecting 
them.5 The right to participation has been further elaborated in subsequent observations and 
conclusions of the Committee in the context of individual complaints brought under the 
first Optional Protocol to the Covenant. The absence of meaningful consultations with the 
indigenous community concerned regarding measures that may affect them, normally 
constitutes a denial of their cultural rights under article 27.6  
</p>
<p>13. Articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women make clear that women&#8217;s right to participation in the 
political and public life of a State should be on equal terms with that of men, including in 
the international area. While the Convention does not specifically make reference to the 
rights of indigenous women, the articles must be read in the light of article 22 of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which ensures that the special needs of 
indigenous women should be protected against all forms of discrimination. Similarly, 
although the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action does not explicitly refer to the 
participation of indigenous women, the Commission on the Status of Women has now 
called for the participation of indigenous women in both the Beijing Platform and the 
Millennium Development Goals.7  
</p>
<p>14. Participation is also one of the guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. Article 12 affirms that children, both individually and collectively, have the right 
to participate in decision-making that may be relevant to their lives and to influence 
decisions taken in their regard, within the family, school or community. Moreover, the 
provisions of the Convention should be interpreted in conjunction with article 30 of the 
Convention, which provides for the right of the indigenous child, in community with other 
members of his or her group, to enjoy, individually or collectively, his or her own culture, 
to profess and practise his or her own religion or to use his or her own language. 
</p>
<p>15. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination obliges States to prohibit and eliminate all forms of racial discrimination, 
including in relation to the enjoyment of political rights, as well as in the conduct of public 
affairs (article 5). In its general recommendation No. 23 (1997) on the rights of indigenous

<p>peoples, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged States parties to 
ensure that members of indigenous peoples had equal rights in respect of effective 
participation in public life and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests 
were taken without their informed consent.8  
</p>
<p>16. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights contains 
provisions affirming the right to participate in the economic, social and cultural life of the 
State. In its general comment No. 20 (2009) on non-discrimination in economic, social and 
cultural rights, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasized that the 
principle of non-discrimination and equality, as articulated in article 2 (2) and reflected 
throughout the Covenant, applies to all the rights contained in the Convention.9  
</p>
<p><b> A. International Labour Organization Convention No. 169  
</b></p>
<p>17. The International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) 
concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries contains a number of 
key provisions on the right to participation of indigenous peoples. The Convention itself is 
grounded in the recognition of the aspirations of indigenous peoples to exercise control 
over their own institutions, ways of life and economic development, and to maintain and 
develop their identities, languages and religions within the framework of the State in which 
they live; the rights of consultation and participation thus represent the cornerstone of the 
Convention. Articles 2 and 33 of the Convention require States to institutionalize the 
participation of indigenous peoples in policies that affect them, as an essential framework 
for the proper application of the provisions of the Convention. These provisions provide for 
States to develop coordinated and systematic action, with the participation of indigenous 
peoples from the outset, to protect the rights of these peoples and to guarantee respect for 
their integrity.10  
</p>
<p>18. Articles 6, 7 and 15 of Convention No. 169 provide a general legal framework with 
regard to the consultation and participation of indigenous peoples. Article 6 requires that 
indigenous peoples be consulted in good faith through appropriate procedures and, in 
particular, through their representative institutions, with the objective of achieving 
agreement or consent, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or 
administrative measures that may affect them directly. This applies to all levels of decision-
making. Although the obligation to consult under the provisions of the Convention is 
interpreted as not requiring that an agreement be reached with indigenous peoples, article 6 
(2) nonetheless requires that there should be an &#8220;objective of achieving agreement or 
consent&#8221; to the proposed measure.  
</p>
<p>19. Article 7 establishes that indigenous peoples have, inter alia, the right to decide their 
own priorities for the process of development as it affects their lives, beliefs, institutions 
and spiritual well-being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use, and, to the extent 
possible, to exercise control over their own economic, social and cultural development. 
These provisions on consultation and participation are key provisions of the Convention 
and establish an important basis for applying all the other provisions, although a number of 
other provisions also make references to the duty of States in relation to consultation and 
participation.11

</i> </p>


<p>20. Article 15 of Convention No. 169 establishes the principle that indigenous peoples 
have the right to the natural resources existing on their lands, including the right to the 
participation, use, management and conservation of these resources. In cases where States 
retain the ownership of mineral or subsoil resources, article 15 (2) requires, as a 
fundamental safeguard, that indigenous peoples be consulted prior to undertaking or 
authorizing the exploration or exploitation of natural resources on indigenous lands, with a 
view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their interests would be prejudiced. 
</p>
<p>21. Convention No. 169 establishes five qualitative requirements for State consultations 
with indigenous peoples. Article 6 (1) (a) of the Convention requires that consultations be 
carried out through representative institutions of indigenous peoples. ILO supervisory 
bodies have emphasized that the determination of representativeness &#8220;should be a result of 
a process carried out by the indigenous peoples themselves&#8221;.12 Consequently, it is required 
that the indigenous peoples or community concerned identify the institutions that meet 
these requirements, prior to any consultations. Moreover, in the light of the fact that many 
indigenous institutions have been undermined in discriminatory historical processes that 
have resulted in an asymmetry in the relationship between States and indigenous peoples, it 
is of crucial importance that States support the development of indigenous peoples&#8217; own 
institutions and initiatives and, when appropriate, provide these with the necessary 
resources.13  
</p>
<p>22. Article 6 (1) (a) of Convention No. 169 establishes that consultations should be 
carried out through appropriate procedures. ILO supervisory bodies consider procedures to 
be appropriate if they create favourable conditions for achieving agreement or consent to 
the proposed measures, regardless of the result obtained.14 General public hearing processes 
are not normally regarded to be sufficient to meet the requirement of &#8220;appropriate 
procedures&#8221;. The ILO Committee of Experts has stated that the content of the consultation 
procedures and mechanisms needs to allow the full expression of the viewpoints of the 
indigenous peoples or communities concerned, in a timely manner and based on their full 
understanding of the issues involved, so that they may be able to affect the outcome and a 
consensus be achieved, and that it be undertaken in a manner that is acceptable to all 
parties.15  
</p>
<p>23. Article 6 (2) of the Convention establishes that consultations should be undertaken 
in good faith and in a form appropriate to the circumstances. This requires that 
consultations be carried out in a climate of mutual trust and transparency. Governments 
must ensure that indigenous peoples have all relevant information concerning the matter at 
hand and that the information can be fully understood by them. Indigenous peoples must be 
given sufficient time to allow them to engage in their own decision-making process, and 
participate effectively in decisions taken in a manner consistent with their cultural and 
social traditions. 
</p>
<p>24. Furthermore, in accordance with article 6 (2) of the Convention, the objective of the 
consultation should be to achieve agreement or consent. This requires that agreement or 
consent be the goal of the parties, and that genuine efforts need to be made to reach an

<p>agreement or achieve consent. This qualitative requirement is closely and inherently linked 
to the requirement that consultations be carried out in good faith. 
</p>
<p>25. Finally, the ILO supervisory bodies have established that there should be a periodic 
evaluation of the effectiveness of existing consultation procedures or mechanisms between 
States and indigenous peoples, with the participation of the indigenous peoples concerned, 
with a view to continuing to improve the effectiveness of such procedures or mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>26. In addition to these standards, Convention No. 169 contains a number of other 
provisions affirming the right to participation of indigenous peoples: 
</p>
<p> (a) The right to participation (art. 2, 5&#8211;7, 15, 22, 23); 
</p>
<p> (b) The right to be consulted (art. 6, 15, 17, 22, 27, 28); 
</p>
<p> (c) The State obligation to cooperate with indigenous peoples (art. 7, 20, 22, 25, 
27, 33); 
</p>
<p> (d) The right of indigenous peoples to decide their own priorities (art. 7); 
</p>
<p> (e) The obligation to refrain from taking measures contrary to the freely 
expressed wishes of indigenous peoples (art. 4); 
</p>
<p> (f) The obligation to seek agreement or consent from indigenous peoples (art. 6); 
</p>
<p> (g) The obligation to seek free and informed consent from indigenous peoples 
(art. 16); 
</p>
<p> (h) The right of indigenous peoples to exercise control over their own 
development (art. 7); 
</p>
<p> (i) The right of indigenous peoples to effective representation (art. 6 and 16). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional instruments and jurisprudence 
</b></p>
<p>27. Regional systems have also contributed significantly to a fuller understanding of the 
content of the right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making. In the Inter-
American regional human rights system, a draft American declaration on the rights of 
indigenous peoples is currently being debated.16 The American Convention on Human 
Rights generally sets forth only individual rights and does not directly address the 
corresponding rights of indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, the lack of specific indigenous 
provisions has not prevented the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights from developing significant case law on the rights 
of indigenous peoples, which have particular relevance to the right to participation in 
decision-making.  
</p>
<p>28. Of particular importance regarding the right to political participation is the case of 
<i>Yatama v. Nicaragua</i>. The Inter-American Court held that the electoral law of Nicaragua 
constituted a disproportionate restriction on the political rights of the candidates of an 
indigenous and ethnic party because the State requirements for participation in the 
municipal elections required a form of organization that was foreign to the customs and 
traditions of the people.17 
</p>
<p>29. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights specifically refers to both the 
rights of individuals and the rights of peoples, and provides for the right of all citizens to

<p>participate freely in the government of the country (article 13), among other relevant 
provisions.18 In 2000, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights established 
the Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities, whose first 
report19 interpreted several provisions of the African Charter in accordance with 
international standards regarding the rights of indigenous peoples. A recent ruling by the 
African Commission for the first time dealt directly with the rights of indigenous peoples. 
In that decision, the Commission condemned the expulsion of the Endorois people from 
their land in Kenya for tourism development, and found that the evictions violated their 
human rights to property, health, culture, religion and natural resources.<b> </b>While not dealing 
explicitly with the right of participation, underlying the case was the fundamental issue that 
the Endorois had been excluded from all decision-making regarding the treatment of their 
lands.20 
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>30. The normative international human rights framework for the collective right to 
participation is the right to self-determination. Affirmed in Article 1 (2) of the Charter of 
the United Nations and other major international legal instruments, including common 
article 1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, self-determination is widely 
acknowledged to be a principle of customary international law and even a peremptory 
norm.21  
</p>
<p>31. The right to self-determination of indigenous peoples is relevant to participation in 
decision-making in various ways. Indigenous peoples have the right to make their own 
independent decisions through which they determine their own political status and pursue 
their economic, social and cultural development. Self-determination is an ongoing process 
which ensures that indigenous peoples continue to participate in decision-making and 
control over their own destinies. It means that the institutions of decision-making should be 
devised to enable indigenous peoples to make decisions related to their internal and local 
affairs, and to participate collectively in external decision-making processes in accordance 
with relevant human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>32. Self-determination is also recognized in article 3 of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, which imports identical wording from the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and recognizes that indigenous peoples are entitled to the right to self-determination, 
as well as the principle of equality enshrined in article 2, recognizing that both indigenous

<p>peoples and individuals are &#8220;equal to all other peoples and individuals&#8221; in the exercise of 
their rights.  
</p>
<p>33. The Declaration also recognizes the related right under article 4 of autonomy or self-
government for indigenous peoples over their internal and local affairs, and clarifies that 
their right to participation goes beyond the right of indigenous individuals to participate in 
electoral processes on the same basis as members of the majority population. Article 5 
states that the exercise of their right to autonomy by indigenous peoples does not in any 
way limit their right to participate fully in the mainstream political life of the State. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Free, prior and informed consent 
</b></p>
<p>34. Indigenous peoples identify the right of free, prior and informed consent as a 
requirement, prerequisite and manifestation of the exercise of their right to self-
determination, as defined in international human rights law. Moreover, the principle is of 
fundamental importance for their participation in decision-making. This is because free, 
prior and informed consent establishes the framework for all consultations relating to the 
acceptance of projects that affect them, and any related negotiations pertaining to benefit-
sharing and mitigation measures. Particular emphasis is placed on free, prior and informed 
consent for projects or measures that have a substantial impact on indigenous communities, 
such as those resulting from large-scale natural resource extraction on their territories22 or 
the creation of natural parks, or forest and game reserves on their lands and territories. 
</p>
<p>35. The Declaration contains a number of provisions requiring the free, prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples in the context of certain decisions affecting them. 
The importance of free, prior and informed consent for the realization of the rights 
articulated in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is reflected in the fact 
that six of its articles contain explicit requirements concerning such consent. Article 10 
establishes that no relocation should take place without the free, prior and informed consent 
of the indigenous peoples concerned. Article 11 establishes an obligation for States to 
provide redress through effective mechanisms with respect to property taken without free, 
prior and informed consent. Article 19 obligates States to consult indigenous peoples in 
order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing 
legislative or administrative measures that may affect them. Article 29 (2) establishes that 
States should take effective measures to ensure that no storage or disposal of hazardous 
materials takes place on lands or territories of peoples without their free, prior and informed 
consent. Finally, article 32 provides in more general terms that States should consult 
indigenous peoples in order to obtain their free, and informed consent prior to the approval 
of any project affecting their lands, territories or resources.  
</p>
<p>36. International human rights treaty bodies, such as the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, have 
also clarified that the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples is required in 
accordance with State obligations under their corresponding treaties.23 In its general 
comment No. 21 (2009) on the right of everyone to take part in cultural life, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights underlined the fact that States parties should

<p>respect the principle of the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples in all 
matters covered by their specific rights.24 In this context, the Committee referred to 
article 6 (1) (a) of ILO Convention No. 169 and article 19 of the Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have also urged States to obtain the 
consent of indigenous peoples in relation to extractive industry projects.25 
</p>
<p>37. Other international instruments also recognize the importance of free, prior and 
informed consent in the context of decision-making by indigenous peoples. For example, 
the Akwe: Kon guidelines for the implementation of article 8j of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity26 and the programme of work on protected areas adopted by the 
Conference of the Parties to the Convention in 200427 recognize free, prior and informed 
consent as being of fundamental importance in the context of protection of the traditional 
knowledge and intellectual property of indigenous peoples, and resettlement in the 
establishment of protected areas. 
</p>
<p>38. At the regional level, the draft American declaration on indigenous peoples contains 
a similar clause to article 32 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
requiring free, prior and informed consent for any plan, programme or proposal affecting 
the rights or living conditions of indigenous peoples. Importantly, the Inter-American Court 
of Human Rights, in relation to mining on the lands of the indigenous Saramaka people in 
Suriname, stated that &#8220;regarding large-scale development or investment projects that would 
have a major impact within Saramaka territory, the State has a duty not only to consult with 
the Saramakas, but also to obtain their free, prior, and informed consent, according to their 
customs and traditions&#8221;.28 
</p>
<p>39. The evolving policies of international financial institutions and development 
agencies, moreover, reflect the importance of the principle of free, prior and informed 
consent. The environmental and social policy adopted by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, recognizes that, for the rights of indigenous peoples to be 
upheld, enabling them to engage in partnerships where they so choose, their free, prior and 
informed consent must be obtained.29 The Asian Development Bank has also recently 
revised its policy in relation to indigenous peoples. The draft of the Safeguard Policy issued 
in October 2008 includes the requirement to obtain free, prior and informed consent in 
relation to projects involving &#8220;commercial development of natural resources on lands used 
by indigenous peoples with impacts on the livelihood, or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual 
uses that define the identity and community of indigenous peoples&#8221;.30  </p>

<p>40. Finally, several treaties between States and indigenous peoples affirm the principle 
of the consent of indigenous peoples as an underpinning of the treaty relationship between 
States and indigenous peoples.31  
</p>
<p>41. The right of indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent forms an integral 
element of their right to self-determination. Hence, the right shall first and foremost be 
exercised through their own decision-making mechanisms. As the right to free, prior and 
informed consent is rooted in the right to self-determination, it follows that it is a right of 
indigenous peoples to effectively determine the outcome of decision-making processes 
impacting on them, not a mere right to be involved in such processes.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The internal decision-making processes and institutions of 
indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>42. Owing to the diversity of situations in which indigenous peoples find themselves 
today, it is difficult to cover the characteristics of their internal decision-making processes 
and institutions globally. The present section can only generalize on the principles of 
indigenous decision-making processes upheld by societies that find themselves in 
traditional and contemporary settings. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Indigenous decision-making processes 
</b></p>
<p>43. The everyday lives of indigenous peoples, both egalitarian communities with no 
obvious hierarchy and more hierarchical ones, are often guided by traditional indigenous 
legal systems, referred to in certain jurisdictions as &#8220;customary laws&#8221;. This term refers to a 
range of legal instruments and can include a variety of distinctive customs, spirituality, 
traditions, procedures and practices. 
</p>
<p>44. Traditional decision-making processes can be localized and restricted to the village 
level, be geographically wide or apply to a whole community of a particular indigenous 
people. While these traditional legal systems are dynamic and responsive to the modern 
world, the laws of a particular community are constantly reinforced through traditional 
practices, socialization and intergenerational transfer of knowledge. These laws also guide 
the bulk of decisions made by the respective indigenous authorities.32  
</p>
<p>45. Decision-making processes include dispute resolution or the adjudication of 
important matters that often rely upon traditional leaders/chiefs and advisers, a council of 
elders or, in some communities, the convening of a council. Wisdom and experience 
account for a large component of decision-making by the leaders or council members, but 
generally, depending on the nature of the concern, all community members are free to 
participate in discussions directly or indirectly. As much as possible, problems are solved 
by consensus using procedures that engage all affected parties and exhaust dissent. Where 
necessary, the physical resolution of differences between parties may involve battles 
</p>
<p>  
 31 In Canada, treaties Nos. 6, 7 and 8 contain provisions on the consent of indigenous peoples. For 
</p>
<p>instance, treaty No. 6, concluded in 1876, provides that &#8220;&#8230;whereas the said Indians have been 
notified and informed by Her Majesty&#8217;s said Commissioners that it is the desire of Her Majesty to 
open up for settlement, immigration and such other purposes ... and to obtain the consent thereto of 
Her Indian subjects inhabiting the said tract&#8230;&#8221; (para. 3).

<p>conducted according to rules until an agreement is reached or affirmed. The main aim of 
any dispute resolution, whether among community members or with others, is primarily to 
maintain peace, unity and harmony. 
</p>
<p>46. With the guidance of indigenous laws and dispute-resolution procedures, decisions 
are generally reached through inclusive and participatory processes. Even in communities 
with strict systems of hierarchy, the chiefs or headmen are expected to obtain counsel from 
wise elders, provide a fair hearing to aggrieved parties, and provide an explanation to the 
community for any disputed decisions. This applies to standard-setting for the community, 
including guidelines for the management of resources and judicial matters. In the case of 
major issues that could dramatically affect the survival of a community, such as a dispute 
over resources, a unanimous decision is often required from a council of elders and the 
community as a whole.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous decision-making institutions 
</b></p>
<p>47. The structure of traditional decision-making institutions varies; systems may be 
hierarchical or flat, but generally there is a council responsible for administering matters in 
order to maintain the peace, harmony and well-being of a community. Indigenous 
institutions usually embody democratic principles in reaching decisions through consensus, 
and these are manifested in power-sharing and co-responsibility among council members. 
Personal integrity, reliability, honesty and far-sightedness are characteristics applied in 
selecting community leaders or council members, besides their knowledge, wisdom and 
sense of justice. The recognition and transfer of authority and leadership, whether 
hereditary or through selection, are also guided by oral history and spiritual and ceremonial 
traditions.33 
</p>
<p>48. Leaders and council members play an important role in ensuring cultural, legal, 
health, economic and political integrity, as well as the development and intergenerational 
transfer of knowledge. Within the council of elders, the village chief is often tasked with 
the overall administration of the village and presides over community meetings and 
hearings to ensure security, peace and stability in the community and that indigenous laws 
and rituals are followed. The role of other council members is often to advise the village 
chief on important matters of concern according to their specialization and to decide 
collectively on various matters. Some communities have shamans or priestesses, whose role 
is to advise the council on spiritual matters. This involves all aspects of life, such as birth, 
puberty, marriage and death, as well as on security, and traditional occupations upon which 
a particular community depends.34  
</p>
<p>49. One key concern for traditional decision-making institutions is that the influence of 
contemporary structures has sometimes led to the council of elders falling into disuse. In 
such cases, village chiefs are the only recognized authority for administering matters that 
concern the community. Not only does this place a burden on the leadership of the 
community, it has also effectively eroded the democratic decision-making principles of 
indigenous communities. Under pressure to act as the spokesperson for governments, this 
arrangement has led, in many countries, to a decline in the village chief&#8217;s objectivity and 
ability to support the interests of the community. This situation is made worse in some

<p>countries where traditional leaders are now appointed by the government to represent the 
community and, in some cases, by companies that have an interest in influencing the affairs 
of a particular community.35 Changes in traditional leadership and representation in this 
manner have a significant negative impact on the internal decision-making systems of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>50. Where traditional leaders have been put in place by mainstream authorities, 
resources are often not made available to support these &#8220;new&#8221; traditional leaders. 
Moreover, not enough training and exposure is given to appointed community leaders to 
ensure that legal and administrative decision-making processes result in quality judgements 
and decisions. Consequently, many indigenous peoples have lost confidence in, or mistrust, 
their own decision-making institutions. Collective reflections by indigenous communities to 
revitalize and regain the respect of decision-making processes and institutions are also 
lacking. Such efforts would represent a major undertaking and require multiple levels of 
intervention, including promoting respect for capable indigenous institutions, asserting the 
right to internal decision-making, and advocating for recognition of indigenous customary 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>51. Many indigenous peoples continue to utilize, have access to and develop traditional 
decision-making structures for internal purposes, notwithstanding the lack of formal 
recognition of these institutions by the State. Some indigenous peoples, nations and 
communities also prefer to remain unrecognized, and forgo the funding, services, 
programmes and legal protections that come with recognition in order to maintain full 
control and independence over their structures.36 
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous parliaments and organizations 
</b></p>
<p>52. Some contemporary indigenous decision-making institutions take the form of 
indigenous parliaments and organizations. These institutions are modelled on traditional 
decision-making institutions, comprising leaders selected by the people they aim to 
represent, and are often guided by statutes and adopt functions that promote the integrity 
and well-being of their constituency or community. 
</p>
<p>53. The Sami Parliaments provide a clear example of an indigenous parliament; the 
indigenous governance in Kuna Yala represents another kind of institution.37  
</p>
<p>54. Many indigenous peoples and communities have now established organizations at 
the local, national, regional and international levels to facilitate decision-making internally, 
and also to engage with the State on various matters. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Indigenous legal systems 
</b></p>
<p>55. Indigenous legal systems, which include legislative (indigenous laws), judicial and 
procedural aspects, are critical to internal decision-making. The judicial and procedural 
aspects include rulings of indigenous courts by the chiefs and councils of elders when

 37 The Kuna Yula is an autonomous territory, or <i>comarca</i>, in Panama, inhabited by the Kuna indigenous 
</p>
<p>people. The name means &#8220;Kuna-land&#8221; or &#8220;Kuna mountain&#8221; in the Kuna language. See Vicente 
Cabedo Mallol, <i>Constitucionalismo y Derecho Ind&#237;gena en Am&#233;rica Latina</i> (Valencia, Polytechnic 
University of Valencia Press, Collecci&#243;n Amadis), pp. 243&#8211;247. </p>


<p>administering indigenous laws and addressing disputes. Indigenous legal systems are often 
based on the principles of collective indemnity and communal solidarity. Fines and 
compensations are regularly decided upon and meted out to provide wrongdoers with an 
opportunity to ask forgiveness from the aggrieved party and the whole community. 
</p>
<p>56. Indigenous law can be seen as having two components: personal law and territorial 
law. Personal law includes aspects related to the family, social, cultural, language, spiritual, 
and traditional economy and property, while territorial law refers to lands, natural resources 
and subsurface resources, but also has a social dimension. Indigenous law applies to 
persons as individuals, as well as to persons in a community.38 
</p>
<p>57. Indigenous legal systems are also linked to indigenous institutions and participatory 
decision-making processes. Equal opportunities are given to all parties to be heard by the 
village chief or leader. If the matter cannot be resolved at that level, it can go through a 
general meeting that includes all members of the community. Such systems usually also 
allow for intercommunity dispute resolutions, as well as with non-indigenous persons. 
Indigenous justice systems are seldom adversarial. Adjudicators do not seek to identify and 
punish the defaulter (unless deemed necessary), but to reconcile the disputing parties with 
each other and the rest of society. 
</p>
<p>58. Often, however, more than one legal system exists in a State, and indigenous 
peoples face enormous problems in maintaining their traditional legal systems. The main 
challenge is the non-acceptance of legal pluralism, including the failure of mainstream legal 
authorities to respect the rulings of indigenous chiefs, elders or councils when 
administering indigenous laws and other disputes, or the failure to recognize such decisions 
as judicial acts. Other obstacles include limited administrative and financial support by 
States; the lack of opportunities to enable traditional leaders to update indigenous laws; and 
the lack of respect for indigenous legal systems by other legal systems. 
</p>
<p>59. Even in States where legal pluralism is applied, one often sees that the State only 
recognizes indigenous law in relation to &#8220;soft&#8221; matters such as social, family and cultural 
issues, but not in relation to &#8220;harder&#8221; issues, such as lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The role of indigenous women in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>60. Generally, indigenous women are not part of official decision-making authorities, 
although they may participate in all deliberations on an equal footing with men. It is 
important to note that indigenous women have not always been excluded from decision-
making, and traditionally played, and may still play, a significant role. For example, in 
North America prior to colonization, women played a much more prominent role in 
decision-making, but the recognition of male roles by colonizers contributed to a perception 
of male dominance that was subsequently perpetuated. Among the Kadazan in Malaysia, 
for instance, the <i>bobohizan</i> or priestess played an active part in the council of elders39 and 
women still play significant leadership roles in the intergenerational transfer of knowledge, 
particularly conservation, language, culture, spirituality and social relations. 
</p>
<p>61. Some indigenous laws may also be seen as being unfair to women, whereas the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples establishes that laws and practices must be 
made compatible with internationally recognized human rights standards. Indigenous 
women now demand representation and ask for customary processes to be reformed, 
lobbying their traditional institutions to include women representatives at various levels of 
</p>
<p>

 39 Submission by JOAS (Malaysia). </p>


<p>decision-making and to recognize women&#8217;s potential for leadership. The rising literacy and 
awareness levels of indigenous women provide scope for greater involvement in seeking 
participation in governance, including their commitment as keepers of traditional 
knowledge. Furthermore, most governments are now more sensitive to the representation of 
women in decision-making spheres and there is now greater awareness of their involvement 
at the national level. It is also recognized that, since learning takes place in cultural and 
ceremonial events where women continue to play a crucial role, women should play a 
decision-making role in such spheres.40 
</p>
<p><b> F. Transformation and challenges of indigenous governance 
</b></p>
<p>62. For indigenous peoples, &#8220;transformation&#8221; often means the revolution of traditional 
ways of life and the gradual acceptance of the intrusion of external and foreign factors, be it 
during colonization, later during nation-State building and continuing today, resulting in the 
replacement of traditional institutions and the development of &#8220;new&#8221; institutions in order to 
fit the new spectrum of legislative and administrative bodies established in post-colonial 
times. Various factors and influences have brought about numerous challenges in 
guaranteeing indigenous decision-making processes and institutions, particularly affecting 
leadership and representation, respect for decisions made, effective participation and 
grievance/conflict resolution mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>63. Indigenous communities continue to maintain and adapt decision-making processes 
and institutions in dynamic ways, as evidenced by the involvement of wider sectors of the 
community, such as women and youth leaders. It should be noted, however, that while 
changes, such as the incorporation of voting standards, are sometimes voluntary, in many 
instances they are not by choice but due to external influences, including the State and other 
factors. Nevertheless, indigenous peoples continue to adapt their processes to find workable 
solutions. For example, today, by and large, electoral systems for selecting traditional 
leadership and for internal decision-making have replaced traditional processes of decision-
making, a practice which was once considered culturally foreign to many indigenous 
peoples. In many ways, voting shortcuts and individualizes decision-making processes; it 
can often be more limited than traditional procedures in terms of addressing dissent and the 
concerns of minority voices within a community, and therefore may not encourage 
cohesion within a community. However, many indigenous communities have managed to 
integrate key elements and principles of traditional decision-making systems into modern 
electoral systems, thus maintaining important aspects of internal decision-making processes 
within more contemporary electoral structures.41 
</p>
<p>64. Nevertheless, there are still many traditional decision-making systems that are intact 
and active, and operate in parallel to hybrid governance systems in indigenous 
communities. The self-governing Topokafa people of central Sulawesi still maintain their 
traditional governance structure and religion distinct from the centralized Indonesian 
structure.42 The Hopi traditional system in the mesas of Northern Arizona, the traditional 
form of consensus decision-making among the Pueblos tribes in New Mexico and the 
Haudenosaune traditional longhouse in the United States of America and Canada are other 
examples.43 There are also various other communities which, mainly owing to their

<p>isolation and distance from the centre of power, continue to practise their traditional 
decision-making methods without interference.44 
</p>
<p>65. Even in areas where traditional decision-making institutions remain intact, there may 
also be interference and a lack of respect for decisions made by indigenous institutions. In 
most countries, for example in Asia,45 the establishment of village councils/committees 
responsible mainly for infrastructure development46 has compartmentalized community 
concerns and kept interest away from maintaining cultural integrity (social, spiritual and 
cultural aspects of life), directing their focus towards a different model of development. 
Related challenges include limited jurisdiction of indigenous institutions in deciding on 
matters concerning communal land and resources, divisions within indigenous 
communities, and conflicts where indigenous models of development and thinking are not 
respected or understood. Finally, there is the challenge of effective intergenerational 
transfer of indigenous knowledge, which further contributes to the decline of indigenous 
decision-making principles. 
</p>
<p>66. The deficiencies of not including women in traditional decision-making systems also 
need to be confronted. This challenge provides an opportunity to address issues that 
governments, non-governmental organizations and social scientists often highlight in 
relation to indigenous systems. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Participation in decision-making mechanisms linked to both 
State and relevant non-State institutions, and processes 
affecting indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation in electoral politics 
</b></p>
<p>67. The right of indigenous peoples to participate in electoral politics is grounded in the 
formal legal recognition of indigenous peoples as a specific group of peoples with specific 
rights. Until very recently, indigenous peoples were often denied this basic recognition, and 
it was only in the 1960s that indigenous peoples in a number of settler societies with 
significant indigenous populations, such as Australia, Canada and the United States of 
America, finally obtained full and unrestricted citizenship rights, including the right to vote. 
</p>
<p>68. In Latin America, the return to democratic regimes by the late 1980s, coupled with 
the call by indigenous and other social movements for fundamental changes, saw the 
passing of new national constitutions that tried to establish a more favourable legislative 
and institutional framework for the recognition of truly multi-ethnic, multilingual and 
pluricultural societies, in which the right of indigenous peoples to participate in electoral 
processes is often the cornerstone of these changes. 
</p>
<p>69. While clear progress has been achieved in a number of countries, recognition of 
indigenous rights has not been universal, as many States still do not formally recognize the 
rights of indigenous peoples in their domestic laws.47 Indeed, very few Asian or African 
</p>

 46 While the structure of these bodies is similar to that of the traditional council of elders - where 
</p>
<p>members are selected or appointed from among community members - their aims, values and 
approaches are very different. 
</p>
<p> 47 Submission by the national human rights institution of El Salvador. </p>


<p>States expressly recognize in their laws or constitutions the existence of indigenous peoples 
within their borders.48 
</p>
<p>70. However, even where new laws or legislative amendments provide for the formal 
recognition of indigenous participation in electoral politics, or allow for such participation 
through general equality provisions, the ability to implement these rights often remains a 
challenge. Such a case was seen, for example, when over 400 indigenous San peoples were 
denied the right to vote in the Botswana 2009 general election, and five San communities 
inside the Central Kalahari Game Reserve were omitted from the electoral register.49 Other 
barriers impeding the full realization of these rights include the requirement of 
identification cards for voting, which can exclude indigenous peoples who often do not 
have them; the inaccessibility of polling centres; the limited availability of civic and voter 
education in indigenous languages; the use of money, coercion and threats; and the 
delineation of electoral boundaries, which can put indigenous peoples at a disadvantage.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation in parliamentary processes 
</b></p>
<p>71. Parliament remains the foremost decision-making body in a democracy, where laws 
are passed, budgets are allocated and the government is held accountable. Being 
represented in parliament is thus practically and symbolically important for indigenous 
communities. A parliament that is unrepresentative will disadvantage or even exclude 
indigenous communities altogether from the political process, with consequences for the 
quality of public life and the stability of the political system and society in general. 
</p>
<p>72. Indigenous peoples worldwide have generally enjoyed increased parliamentary 
representation in recent years. This has been achieved in various ways, although there are 
still many challenges to be faced in improving both representation and its effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>73. In certain countries, indigenous peoples have been elected to normal parliamentary 
seats without special measures. This has been most successful in States with large 
indigenous populations, such as in the Plurinational State of Bolivia50 and in Greenland, 
where all members of the <i>Inatsisartut</i> (parliament) and the <i>Naalakkersuisut</i> (cabinet) are of 
Inuit descent. In other States, where indigenous peoples are not in the majority, there is also 
increased representation; for example, in Nicaragua, indigenous peoples have increased 
their representation in the National Assembly.51 
</p>
<p>74. Other States have increased indigenous representation through reserved seats for 
indigenous representatives in parliament, which may also involve specially defined 
electoral districts. Such has been the case, for example, in New Zealand (Aotearoa), since 
</p><p>1867. In some situations, indigenous groups with special political arrangements enjoy 
representation in local processes.52 In other circumstances, while there are no formal 
obstacles to indigenous participation, historical, structural and social pressures have seen 
the increased participation of some groups, but not of others.53

<p>75. Other aspects of indigenous participation in electoral processes include increased 
visibility and influence of indigenous political parties. However, it is also important to 
ensure that mainstream political parties take into account the need for diversity within 
parties and ensure adequate indigenous representation within their own structures to avoid 
ongoing exclusion, particularly of numerically small indigenous groups. Special 
arrangements that provide for indigenous influence in governmental decision-making often 
include ensuring indigenous representation in elective bodies. Examples of these initiatives 
may be found in Burundi and Rwanda, where specific measures have been taken to ensure 
the representation of the Batwa in parliament. 
</p>
<p>76. It is possible that more than one measure is needed. For example, in New Zealand, a 
combination of reserved seats and proportional representation has led to the Maori being 
represented in parliament in proportion to their population. Other political factors, including 
in relation to political parties, have also contributed in such a way that Maori interests are 
currently much better represented in parliamentary decision-making. 
</p>
<p>77. There are also risks, despite special measures being taken. In Nepal, for example, 
despite the significant number of indigenous representatives resulting from demands for 
proportional representation in the Constituent Assembly that is currently drafting the 
country&#8217;s new constitution, the formal representatives were chosen by political parties and 
are expected to act in strict conformity with the manifestos of those parties.54 
</p>
<p>78. A related risk is that a minority representation will be unable to protect indigenous 
interests in the face of political opposition. Although parliamentary systems differ, 
indigenous parliamentarians should have access to leadership positions within the 
parliament. Without the support of parliamentary leaders, indigenous parliamentarians 
experience difficulty in getting their proposals onto the parliamentary agenda and in 
moving them through the parliamentary process.55 
</p>
<p><b> C. Direct participation in governance 
</b></p>
<p>79. Indigenous peoples also participate in the governance and administrative affairs of 
States through a wide variety of mechanisms. Some States have established an indigenous 
secretariat, commission or department to ensure that policy decisions made at the national 
and international levels take into account the human rights of indigenous peoples.56 It 
should be noted, however, that some indigenous peoples are opposed to such a solution, 
believing that this compartmentalizes indigenous issues, which should instead be 
mainstreamed throughout all political structures. 
</p>
<p>80. Some local arrangements provide for communities to define a communal authority, 
chosen according to indigenous customs and traditions to represent them legally, and 
recognize such communal authority as the administrative and traditional government. A 
potential challenge here could take the form of complicated administrative requirements to 
gain legal recognition.57 
</p>
<p>81. A method commonly used in many countries is to recognize autonomous regions 
within a State, whereby indigenous peoples can directly govern themselves and define 
matters within that region. Examples include India58 and Nicaragua.59

<p>82. The introduction of a public government in areas where indigenous peoples form a 
majority is another example of direct self-governance. Examples include Greenland60 and 
Nunavut,61 in which the Inuit enjoy a majority in public government bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Participation in hybrid systems of governance 
</b></p>
<p>83. Alternative models include what have been termed hybrid systems of governance, in 
which indigenous peoples participate in governmental processes by applying, to varying 
degrees, their own decision-making structures and practices. 
</p>
<p>84. In the judicial context, some States incorporate indigenous laws into statutory laws, 
allowing communities to decide matters according to their own laws.62 In some cases, 
constitutional recognition is also accorded to customary laws, as in the case of Malaysia, 
which allows the State of Sabah to enact laws autonomously and establish indigenous legal 
institutions to implement such laws. Other models include recognizing the jurisdiction of 
indigenous law over specific areas of cultural importance.63 
</p>
<p>85. Other jurisdictions have focused on the participation of indigenous elders to varying 
degrees, such as in Australia for instance, in hearing cases involving Aboriginal people 
within the mainstream criminal justice system. The aim is to make court processes more 
culturally appropriate, so as to engender greater trust between indigenous communities and 
judicial officers, and to permit more informal exchanges of information about defendants 
and their cases. 
</p>
<p>86. When looking at different hybrid judicial models, what is important is that 
indigenous peoples are fully consulted and participate in deciding on the structure of such 
bodies. Moreover, from the diverse nature of the submissions received as contributions to 
the study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, it is evident 
that, while some indigenous peoples may applaud the incorporation of indigenous laws into 
national laws, this may not always be the case, as some communities feel that the 
incorporation of these laws into mainstream systems can distort the spirit of these laws or 
contribute to the loss of indigenous control over their own legal and other systems. 
</p>
<p><b> E. State-established councils or committees 
</b></p>
<p>87. Indigenous peoples have been particularly critical of certain State-established 
councils and committees, especially where such bodies have effectively taken over 
traditional decision-making processes. Indeed, these structures have been used historically 
by governments to convey a semblance of engagement with communities, while serving the 
purpose of silencing indigenous dissent towards government policies and practices. 
Indigenous representatives are often appointed to State-controlled committees on the basis 
of their appeal to government, while the procedure for appointment itself has often been

<p>non-transparent. Moreover, these appointees do not necessarily reflect the position of their 
communities, may have limited knowledge of the subject matter and are often inaccessible 
to the community they purport to represent. Since the government often pays the salary of 
appointees, they may be afraid to alienate their employer by criticizing government policy. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Implementing free, prior and informed consent for development 
projects 
</b></p>
<p>88. Increasingly, indigenous peoples worldwide are struggling to maintain control over 
their lands and resources in the face of growing encroachment on their territories by both 
small- and large-scale development projects. Conflicts regarding the protection and use of 
natural resources at stake in many such projects are increasing, and both the human and 
environmental impact of these projects continues to affect indigenous communities. These 
projects often involve a diverse range of actors, including States and private companies, and 
sometimes international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations. Many 
decisions connected to these development projects drastically affect the rights of  
indigenous peoples, yet are taken without their free, prior and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>89. The legal framework for free, prior and informed consent is set out above, and its 
normative character has been explored by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people.64 Substantively, the right of 
consultation as generally established by the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples requires &#8220;effective&#8221; participation, not pro forma consultations, the goal of which is 
to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>90. Despite the clear standard that free, prior and informed consent provides, 
consultation processes have been carried out in this pro forma way, and have been 
manipulated as public relations tools to endorse proposals regarding development projects, 
by demonstrating so-called support from the community, citing irrelevant comments and 
downplaying dissenting voices.65 
</p>
<p>91. In order to avoid such manipulation, some communities have established clear 
protocols to ensure that any consultation with them is based on the standard of free, prior 
and informed consent. Such an approach has been successful in some circumstances,66 and 
indigenous communities need access to capacity-building to be able to continue to develop 
culturally appropriate protocols and procedures for consultation that are relevant to their 
communities. 
</p>
<p>92. States may sometimes impose statutory obligations on third parties involved in a 
project to provide notice to indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples have been frustrated, 
however, by the volume of requests they receive from government agencies, the absence of 
adequate funding, and the lack of an effective mechanism for managing the referrals 
process.67 While indigenous peoples should be included in administrative procedures, 
legislative &#8220;notice&#8221; provisions for third parties may not necessarily meet the standard of 
consulting with indigenous people in a manner consistent with the international standard of 
free, prior and informed consent.

<p><b> G. Participation in establishing alternative organizations 
</b></p>
<p>93. To overcome obstacles to meaningful participation in formalized State-driven 
mechanisms, many indigenous peoples have formed local, regional or international non-
political associations to advocate their interests. Indeed, in countries where indigenous 
peoples have been excluded from formal processes, these organizations have played an 
important role in representing indigenous peoples and making collective decisions about 
social, cultural and religious life.68 
</p>
<p>94. Such structures often provide links between indigenous groups by forming alliances 
and represent a range of diverse and varied interests and peoples. These organizations have 
also used their collaborative positions to discuss common challenges, and speak out 
collectively on fundamental issues that affect them.69 Organizations have worked cross-
border, and have drafted international agreements regarding issues affecting them.70 
</p>
<p>95. Nevertheless, gaining recognition from States is still a significant challenge, since 
these organizations are often overlooked or excluded from formal decision-making 
processes.71 
</p>
<p><b> H. Participation in regional and international forums and processes 
</b></p>
<p>96. Indigenous peoples have also been participating actively in international 
mechanisms in order to achieve greater protection of their rights. Relevant United Nations 
agencies, treaty bodies and other international mechanisms have enabled direct 
participation of indigenous peoples at the highest levels.72 Another example is the Arctic 
Council, an intergovernmental organization where indigenous Arctic peoples and 
organizations have status as &#8220;permanent participants&#8221;. The category of permanent 
participants provides for active participation and consultation with the indigenous 
representatives within the Arctic Council structure.73 It is noted, however, that the ILO does 
not allow indigenous peoples to participate directly in their conferences, despite repeated 
calls for this by a number of United Nations bodies.74 
</p>
<p>97. An appropriate goal is the full and direct participation of indigenous peoples in all 
international processes on matters that particularly concern them. These include 
biodiversity and climate change negotiations, since they often have a disproportionate 
impact on indigenous peoples and their territories. However, consistent financial and 
administrative support is needed to ensure that indigenous peoples maintain appropriate 
participation in international bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Other issues and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>98. While a number of positive steps have been taken regarding indigenous participation 
in external decision-making processes, progress is not uniform and still requires serious

<p>attention. Even in States where the law appears to demonstrate full recognition of the right 
of indigenous peoples to participate in all levels of decision-making, there is often a gap 
between the formal legislative intent and the practical implementation of those rights. 
</p>
<p>99. One key concern is the question of access to information. Information is necessary 
to ensure that indigenous peoples participate in decision-making in an informed way. 
Consistent and wide dissemination of information to indigenous peoples in culturally 
appropriate ways, and in a timely manner, is often lacking. This is particularly true with 
regard to new issues, where indigenous peoples may not necessarily have the skills or 
access to technology to address them properly. 
</p>
<p>100. It is also important that all sectors of indigenous society have the opportunity to 
engage and participate in consultative and decision-making structures. This is especially 
true for women and youth, who are often marginalized from these processes. 
</p>
<p>101. Finally, decision-making structures need to have legitimacy and credibility within 
indigenous communities. Selection processes need to be transparent and truly participatory. 
One challenge is to develop the leadership capacity of indigenous individuals with the long-
term goal of ensuring indigenous participation in decision-making, where indigenous 
peoples feel properly represented, and that their voices are not only heard but taken into 
account.
