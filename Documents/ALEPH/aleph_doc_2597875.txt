COMMENTARY ON RESULTS
Overview 
 
Astron  Corporation  Limited  (Astron  HK)  is  the  group’s  holding  company.  Astron  HK  controls  100%  of  Astron 
Limited.  Astron  Limited  in  turn  controls  three  wholly  owned  operating  subsidiaries:  Donald  Mineral  Sands  Pty 
Limited  (DMS),  Yingkou  Mineral  Resources  Company  Limited  (Resources)  and  Astron  Titanium  Yingkou 
Company Limited (Titanium).  Donald holds the Donald mineral sands mining project (Donald Project). Resources 
and Titanium are Astron’s Chinese operating companies.  
 
Financials 
 
Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income 
 

Total revenue comprising sales, interest received and other income decreased over the prior year. This is 
due to the sale of Chinese land brought to account in the prior year, reduced interest income from cash on 
deposit and limited trading in Chinese markets. 
 
Administration expenditure decreased by $1,622,852 (2015 reduction: $1,332,154). This decrease is due to 
ongoing expenditure rationalisation.


Accrued costs associated with Gambia litigation comprise legal fees and associated advisors’ costs (relating 
to the application for annulment of the award made in favour of Astron that is being pursued by The Gambia).
Statement of financial position 
 

Available for sale financial assets comprise shares in South American Iron & Steel, Altona Mining, Zambezi 
Resources and Greenpower Energy. The combined market value of these investments has decreased by 
$352,614 from 30 June 2015 however this  was offset by proceeds from the sale of Altona Mining shares 
totalling $223,817.



The increase in intangible assets arises from development expenditure capitalised in respect of the Donald 
and Senegal Projects.
Land use rights comprise 50 year land use leases. These leases are capitalised and amortised over the 50 
year period.
The movement in the net asset value from 38.8 cps at 30 June 2015 to 29.9 cps at 30 June 2016 primarily 
results from the increase in capitalised expenditure into the Donald and Senegal projects.
Operations review  
 
Donald 
 
The development of the Donald project (“DMS”) continued during the period under audit.  Progress was made in 
the following areas:

Summary of results and commentary
For the Year Ended 30 June 2016
Feasibility study
  DMS  has  completed  the  technical  aspects  of  the  optimisation  of  the  feasibility  study  as  previously 
announced and work continues on the capex and opex aspects of the optimisation. Initial indications are 
that improvements from the updated technical aspects and the use of Chinese equipment will noticeably 
reduce  capex.  An  updated  feasibility  study  is  anticipated  to  be  completed  and  announced  in  the  4th 
quarter of calendar year 2016.
Water
  DMS had assessed that it had a quantity of carryover water surplus to its anticipated requirements. As 
such DMS traded 5 gigalitres (5,000 megalitres) of water to the Victorian Environmental Water Holder to 
help  protect  habitat,  water  quality  and  animals  in  Wimmera  and  Glenelg  waterways  and  the  western 
rivers.
  DMS  was  able  to  contribute  to  this  important  environmental  cause  (at  well  below  DMS's  cost)  having 
considered  possible  impacts  of  foreseeable  future  water  allocations  and  DMS's  future  project 
commencement needs.
Geology and mining
  Additional 2015 drilling and sampling was undertaken on the Donald and Jackson mineral sands deposits
and a Mineral Resource update for the Donald Mineral Sands Project was announced on 7 April 2016.
  Metallurgical and mining optimisation is ongoing. 
  The work plan is progressing towards submission, anticipated to be in the 4th quarter of calendar year
2016.
Land
  No further land was purchased during the year.
Funding
  The company continues to consider funding and optimisation options on the basis of its feasibility study 
while continuing to work towards satisfaction of conditions precedent as per the funding agreement with 
the  China  Machinery  Engineering  Corporation  (CMEC)  which  sets  out  the  parties’  intentions  and  the 
process for agreeing on an EPC contract for supply and installation of equipment for the MUP/WCP for 
the Donald Mineral Sands project and assistance with funding the Project.
China operations
  Work in China continued to test and develop technology to be applied for downstream advancement of
Group minerals. 
 
Senegal
  Work  continued  on  the  components  required  to  apply  for  the  mining  licence  which  is  subject  to 
Government  approval,  with  the  public  enquiry  meetings  conducted  and  Astron  being  advised  that  in 
principle this milestone will be achieved.
America
  Astron continues to seek mineral sands deposits in USA for processing and sale in China.
