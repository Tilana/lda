7.      
Considering the facts in this case I take 09 months as the starting point for your sentence. 

Aggravating Factors 

8.      
The victim is your sister. Therefore this comes under the definition of domestic violence. For this I add 03 months to reach 12 months. 
9.      

Mitigating Factors 

10.     
For pleading guilty in the first available opportunity I follow the decision in Vilimone v State [2008] and deduct 1/3 from your sentence to reach 08 months imprisonment. 

11.     
You are 28 years and single. You asked for forgiveness from this Court. You are a first offender and also reconciled with the victim. For these mitigating factors I deduct another 03 months from your sentence to reach 05 months imprisonment. 

12.     
Section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree has given powers to this Court to suspend a sentence which does not exceed two years. 

13.     
You are a first offender. You pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity thereby saving this Court's time and resources. You have reconciled with your sister. After considering all these factors I believe you need to be given a chance to reform. 

14.     
Accordingly you are sentenced to 05 months imprisonment for the offence of Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm and this sentence will be suspended for 01 year.

15.     
If you commit any crime during next 01 year you can be charged under section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.
