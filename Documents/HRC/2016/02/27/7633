<p><i>Summary 
</i>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur highlights the efforts of the 
</p>
<p>Government in combating trafficking in children, including through the ratification 
of international and regional instruments and the adoption of a multisectoral 
approach to combating trafficking in persons. The Special Rapporteur expresses 
concerns with regard to, inter alia, the absence of legal and policy frameworks as 
well as of targeted policies and institutions to prevent and combat trafficking in 
persons. She also notes the lack of comprehensive support for victims of trafficking, 
such as the unavailability of shelters, psychosocial support and appropriate holding 
facilities for irregular migrants, as well as fast-track deportation procedures which 
do not allow for identification of victims of trafficking and traffickers. There is also 
an apparent lack of capacity regarding all stakeholders, including front-line officials, 
law enforcement agents and civil society organizations, as well as a lack of 
awareness on the part of the general population with regard to the issue of 
trafficking. As a result, the potential scale of the problem of trafficking in persons, 
its trends and scope appear to be somewhat underestimated and unknown in the 
absence of statistical information on trafficking in persons. She makes 
recommendations to the Government, including on addressing gaps in the anti-
trafficking legislative, policy and institutional frameworks; improving the justice 
system; putting in place a comprehensive data collection system on trafficked

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 27 to 31 January 2014, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, conducted an official visit to Seychelles 
at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit to Mahe, the Special Rapporteur met with government official, 
including the Minister for Labour and Human Resource Development; the Minister of 
Community Development, Social Affairs and Sports; the Minister for Tourism and Culture; 
the Minister for Health and the Minister for Home Affairs and Transport. She also held 
meetings with the Principal Secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Department 
of Social Affairs and the Immigration and Civil Status Department; members of the 
National Assembly; the Ambassador for Women and Children; the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court; the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Police. She further engaged 
with the Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission and members of the 
National Committee on Trafficking in Persons. She also interacted with members of civil 
society organizations and the media. In addition, she visited the President&#8217;s Village 
Children&#8217;s Home, a temporary guesthouse for irregular migrants, the migrant holding area 
at the Central Police Station and the Indian Ocean Tuna factory<i>. </i>Finally, she exchanged 
views with representatives of the United Nations Agencies as well as the British and Indian 
High Commissioners for Seychelles. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she could not 
meet with any victims of trafficking as none were identified either by the Government or 
civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>3. The objectives of the visit were to explore the incidence, trends and root causes of 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in Seychelles and to examine the 
initiatives and measures taken by the Government and civil society to combat and prevent 
this phenomenon, in the light of existing international law.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses her sincere appreciation to the Government, and 
in particular the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the indispensable support it provided in 
planning and coordinating the visit. She thanks James Alix Michel, President of the 
Republic of Seychelles, for engaging in person with her on this issue, which she sees as a 
strong demonstration of his political will to address the phenomenon of trafficking in 
persons and ensure that it does not take root in the country. She further thanks the civil 
society organizations and the United Nations (in particular, the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP); the World Health Organisation (WHO); the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) &#8211; Southern Africa; the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) &#8211; Mauritius Office; the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8211; Regional Office for Southern Africa; as well 
as the Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecutions Intelligence Coordination Center (RAPPICC) for 
their assistance and support before, during and after the mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>5. As a result of its geographical location, tourism attractions, the relatively small size 
of its population and its middle income economic development, Seychelles has a large 
population of both tourists and migrant workers. In 2012, the estimated number of tourists </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>was 208,000, almost three times the size of its population,1 while foreign migrant workers 
constituted about 20 per cent of its population. 
</p>
<p>6. The phenomenon of trafficking in persons in Seychelles is at best insidious and 
remains hidden as a result of lack of awareness. Notwithstanding, the Special Rapporteur 
noted considerable anecdotal evidence suggesting that trafficking in persons occurs in 
Seychelles. Available information indicates that the country may increasingly become a 
destination for trafficking for sexual exploitation, especially of women from Eastern 
Europe. Furthermore, allegations of cases of sexual exploitation of Seychellois girls by both 
their boyfriends/pimps and families emerged. Cases of mixed migration and trafficking for 
the purpose of labour exploitation reportedly involving migrant workers in the construction 
and fishery sectors from Bangladesh, China, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Sri Lanka and the 
Philippines were also identified. Moreover, a growing use of migrant domestic workers, 
with possible indications of links to domestic servitude, especially from Madagascar, 
Mauritius, Nepal, Philippines and Sri Lanka, emerged as an issue during the visit. There 
were also reports of possible trafficking into fishing vessels following the case of nine 
Pakistanis found abandoned in a port in Victoria and assisted by a local civil society 
organization.  
</p>
<p>7. Root causes of trafficking include poverty and lack of economic opportunities in 
source countries. The high demand for unskilled labour in the construction and fishery 
sectors based in Seychelles, as well as demand for cheap domestic work from middle/high-
income households in Seychelles, also fuel trafficking in persons. It should be noted that 
Seychellois nationals are reluctant to take up low-paying work, leaving the aforementioned 
sectors in need of a foreign workforce. Moreover, the flourishing tourism industry and the 
demand for commercial sexual services by nationals, tourists and the large population of 
male migrant workers are some of the underlying factors contributing to trafficking in 
women and children for sexual exploitation. The growing prevalence of drug and substance 
dependence also fuel Seychellois children&#8217;s vulnerability to in-country sex trafficking. 
</p>
<p>8. In the almost complete absence of accurate data on trafficking in persons from both 
the State and civil society organizations, the Special Rapporteur found it difficult to assess 
the exact scope and magnitude of trafficking in persons, especially women and children. 
The lack of legal and institutional protection frameworks for victims of trafficking 
reinforces the invisibility of the problem and thus the extent, trends and manifestations 
thereof are unknown.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking of girls and women for sexual exploitation and prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>9. Information received during the visit suggests that Seychelles may increasingly 
become a destination country for foreign women subjected to sex trafficking. Women from 
Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine, are reportedly recruited to Seychelles with promises 
of modelling jobs and subsequently subjected to high-class forced prostitution in private 
homes and hotels. The Special Rapporteur also learned that, upon their arrival at the airport 
as tourists, these women are reportedly escorted as very important persons (VIPs), directly 
bypassing immigration control. A 2011 government study also identified a group of 
Russian prostitutes based in Dubai who operate in Seychelles, especially when American 
navy ships arrive in Victoria port.2 There are risks that these women may have been 
trafficked to Seychelles for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.

</p>
<p>10. Available information also point toward to internal trafficking of Seychellois 
children for sexual purposes. According to official sources, cases of forced prostitution of 
Seychellois girls, including minors, by their boyfriends/pimps who control their earnings 
are not uncommon.3 Drug and substance dependency of both the girls and their pimps are 
identified as the leading cause of such types of sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>11. Further information indicates the possible forced high-class prostitution of 
Seychellois girls and, according to some sources, boys &#8211; particularly on the main island of 
Mahe &#8211; by foreign clients. Foreign clients were identified as male or female visitors/tourists 
or locally employed foreign men; while girls aged 16 and onwards are most at risk, girls as 
young as 14 years of age were reportedly forcibly prostituted.4 Moreover, a considerable 
number of mothers push their own children, both female and male, into forced prostitution 
in order to financially sustain the family.5 
</p>
<p>12. The prevalence of substance abuse, poverty, and the continuing demand for 
commercial sexual services by nationals, tourists and migrant workers are some of the 
underlying factors that contribute to the sexual exploitation of trafficked women and 
children in Seychelles.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trafficking for labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>13. Seychelles has a large population of migrant workers, a large portion of whom are 
unskilled and semi-skilled. According to official statistics, the vast majority of the migrant 
workers, who constitute about one fifth of the population of the country, are employed in 
the manufacturing (mainly fishery) and construction sectors, comprising nearly one third of 
the total workforce.6 The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that a significant portion of 
migrants work within the Seychelles International Trade Zone (SITZ) where the national 
Labour Law &#8211; the Employment Act 1995, which protects workers&#8217; rights &#8211; is inapplicable. 
However, the International Trade Zone (Employment) Regulations 1997 and the 
International Trade Zone (Conditions of Employment) Order 1997, are applicable and, as 
posited by the Government, do not make the workers any more vulnerable to situations of 
forced labour than workers who work outside of the SITZ. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed of several cases of unskilled and semi-skilled migrant workers, especially from 
Bangladesh, China and India, reportedly facing exploitation, including poor working 
conditions, underpayment and late payment of wages, substandard housing and withholding 
of passports &#8211; possible indicators of forced labour. Over the past two years, a number of 
public demonstrations held by groups of migrant workers to peacefully protest about their 
working conditions have resulted in their deportation. There were also allegations of two 
suicides of migrant workers, which were attributed to work-related frustrations. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that the Employment and other related acts apply to both Seychellois and 
foreigners. In this regard she also welcomes the increase in wage as of January 2014 to all 
workers, including migrants. However, cumbersome procedures and penalties for going on 
strike,7 which include prosecution, payment of a fine ranging from Sr 5,000 to Sr 10,000 
and deportation, dissuade migrant workers from exercising their rights to strike. 
</p>
<p>14. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received information from non-governmental 
sources that fishermen on board Asian fishing boats in Seychelles territorial waters or ports 
have reportedly been subjected to abuse, including, but not limited to, denial of payment,

<p>physical abuse and being left abandoned in ports. A case in point involves nine Pakistani 
fishermen allegedly abandoned in a port in Victoria for nine months. According to 
information provided, the fishermen had not received wages for an entire year&#8217;s work on 
board the Asian fishing vessel. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Domestic servitude 
</b></p>
<p>15. From January to August 2013, the Immigration Division issued Gainful 
Occupational Permits to 40 foreign domestic workers in Seychelles employed as carers, 
live-in nannies and housemaids, inter alia.8 Of these, 80 per cent were female. While not all 
domestic workers are victims of trafficking, the Special Rapporteur received information 
indicating possible trafficking for the purpose of domestic servitude. Increasing evidence 
suggests that young women from Madagascar, Mauritius, Nepal, Philippines and Sri Lanka, 
most of whom are single mothers from rural areas and with limited education, are brought 
into Seychelles and deceived into working long hours, with little or no pay and with 
restricted freedom of movement. A case in point involves a Mauritian victim of domestic 
servitude identified by a health worker who realized that her passport had been withheld by 
her employer and that she had not received payment for her work.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy and institutional frameworks for combating 
trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. At the international level, Seychelles has been a party to the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime since 2004 and to the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing it (Palermo Protocol) since 2010. Moreover, it has ratified all of the core 
human rights instruments, a number of which have particular relevance to combating 
trafficking, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including its Optional Protocol 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; and the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their 
Families. Seychelles has yet to ratify International Labour Organization Convention No. 
189 (2011) concerning decent work for domestic workers. 
</p><p>17. At the regional level, Seychelles is a party to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, its Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa, the African Charter on the 
Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Southern African Development Community 
Gender and Development Protocol.  
</p>
<p>18. At the national level, Seychelles does not yet have specific legislation dealing with 
trafficking in persons. The Government had identified this shortcoming, and at the time of 
the visit of the Special Rapporteur had plans to draft an anti-trafficking Act. In the 
meantime, some relevant legislation may be invoked to prosecute offences that could 
amount to trafficking in persons and other forms of exploitation.  
</p>
<p>19. Chapter XV of the Penal Code on Offences against Morality defines and punishes 
sexual assault with 20 years&#8217; imprisonment (sect. 130). Abduction of women for the 
purpose of sexual act and sexual interference with a child below the age of 15 carry terms

</p>
<p>of 7 and 20 years&#8217; imprisonment respectively.9 The procurement or attempt to procure 
women under the age of 21 years for forced prostitution in Seychelles or outside the 
country, and the detention of a woman or a girl for forced prostitution are prohibited.10 
Soliciting in public places; keeping or renting premises for use as a brothel; and living off 
the earning of prostitution are offences punishable with 2 to 5 years imprisonment.11 
Moreover, foreign prostitutes or any person who lives on the earnings of prostitution or has 
procured another person for immoral purposes are systematically categorized as prohibited 
immigrants liable to expulsion.12 However, there is no exemption in this or any other law to 
protect potential victims of trafficking who may have been forced into prostitution from 
being deported, possibly back into the hands of their traffickers, for practising prostitution.  
</p>
<p>20. The<b> </b>Constitution provides for freedom from slavery.13 Penalties for offences against 
liberty provided for in the<b> </b>Penal Code cover kidnapping and abduction with intent to 
confine a person; or in order to subject a person to slavery; and kidnapping of a child under 
the age of 14 years, which carry penalties of 7, 14 and 10 years&#8217; imprisonment 
respectively.14 The buying or disposing of any person as a slave carries a 10-year 
imprisonment while the habitual dealing in slaves is punished with 14 years&#8217; 
imprisonment.15  
</p>
<p>21. In addition, forced or obligatory labour is prohibited in the<b> </b>Constitution.16 It is also 
prohibited in the Penal Code, which prescribes three years&#8217; imprisonment for unlawful 
compulsory labour (sect. 251). Minimum labour protection standards, including working 
hours, paid leave and regular payment of wages are set out in the Employment Act, which 
governs the relationship between workers and their employers. With regard to migrant 
workers, the Employment Act 1995 extends its scope to non-Seychellois workers and 
contains provisions that prohibit labour exploitation.17 However, as previously noted, this 
national labour law is limited in its application and migrant workers in the International 
Trade Zone are excluded from its jurisdiction. Notwithstanding, the International Trade 
Zone (Employment) Regulations, 1997 and the International Trade Zone (Conditions of 
Employment) Order, 1997, regulate the process of recruitment of workers and their 
conditions of service, including for Non-Seychellois workers within the Seychelles 
International Trade Zone.18  
</p>
<p>22. With regard to children, the Constitution, under section 31, sets the minimum age 
for work at 15 and stipulates a higher minimum age for dangerous, harmful, and unhealthy 
occupations. Furthermore, it ensures &#8220;special protection against social and economic 
exploitation as well as physical and moral dangers to which children and young persons are 
exposed to.&#8221; The Conditions of Employment Regulations, 1991, prohibit children under the 
age of 18 from night employment and from employment in the restaurant, tourism or 
entertainment industries. Exceptionally, children aged 15 to 17 may work in these 
industries and at night with the written approval of a competent officer. Exploitative acts 
often committed in the process of trafficking, such as using or employing a child in a way 
that may be physically or mentally harmful to the child or affect the child&#8217;s growth or

<p>development are prohibited under the Children Act (1998). The Act specifically contains 
provisions preventing children from being taken out of Seychelles for immoral purposes as 
defined in section XV of the Penal code.19  
</p>
<p>23. Other legislation that could contribute to combatting trafficking in persons include 
the Protection of Human Rights Act, 2009, which promotes witness protection; the 
Proceeds of Crime Act, 2008 (civil confiscation), which applies to confiscation of property 
acquired from criminal conduct; and the Evidence Act, 2009, which allows hearings in 
camera to protect child victims of sexual violence. However, a big gap is the lack of 
witness, victim and whistle-blower protection in the criminal justice system as a whole. The 
Special Rapporteur notes the need for the draft anti-trafficking legislation to extend such 
protection to witnesses, whistle-blowers and victims of trafficking before, during and after 
trial to protect them from reprisal attacks, stigmatization and embarrassment. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an adequate legal framework 
to prevent and combat trafficking in persons in conformity with the Palermo Protocol, 
especially within the definition of article 3. Consequently, trafficking in persons is not a 
specific offence, which makes it difficult to prosecute, particularly in cases of cross-border 
trafficking, and punish traffickers. She recalls that articles 5 and 2 of the Palermo Protocol 
require ratifying States Parties to take legislative steps to criminalize trafficking; protect the 
human rights of victims and to prevent and combat trafficking in persons. Moreover, by 
focusing exclusively on some aspects related to trafficking for sexual and labour 
exploitations, the existing legislation excludes other forms of exploitation including 
trafficking for the purpose of domestic servitude and removal of organs. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. At the time of the visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that Seychelles was 
working towards the establishment of a national strategic framework and action plan to 
combat trafficking in persons (2014&#8211;2015). Under this national plan, the country envisages 
the revision of its legal framework on trafficking; the prosecution of perpetrators and 
improvement of access to justice for all trafficked persons; and the improvement of access 
to protection and assistance mechanisms in line with international standards in cooperation 
with relevant national stakeholders. It further plans to build the capacity of all stakeholders 
for the effective prevention and prosecution of cases of trafficking in persons and protection 
of victims; the raising of awareness/sensitization of the population at large on trafficking in 
persons; and the strengthening of international cooperation with regard to investigation and 
prosecution of the crime of trafficking in persons.20 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the involvement of relevant 
government offices, civil society organizations and the United Nations in the preliminary 
stages of drafting, through consultative meetings held around the draft action plan. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>27. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Seychelles had an interministerial 
committee on trafficking with a specific mandate to oversee the development and drafting 
of legislation on trafficking in persons, a national action plan, and capacity-building 
activities for stakeholders. The committee was established in 2012 by the Cabinet of 
Ministers for a two-year term and is co-chaired by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of Social Affairs, and includes<b> </b>representatives from Immigration, Customs, the

</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8217;s efforts in adopting a 
multisectoral approach to address the phenomenon of trafficking in persons as well as the 
support provided by partners such as UNODC and IOM; however she notes the evident 
lack of human and financial capacities, thus hindering the committee in achieving the 
desired impact in the two years of its existence. She was also pleased to learn that the 
appointment of a new committee on trafficking is envisaged in the draft anti-trafficking bill. 
The broader mandate of this mechanism is expected to include provisions for guiding the 
Government on strategies and policies to tackle human trafficking, putting in place 
effective legislation, awareness-raising and capacity-building for stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>29. While not directly working on anti-trafficking issues, the Department of Social 
Affairs under the Ministry of Social Affairs, Community Development and Sports aims, 
inter alia, to restore social functioning and alleviate social problems by safeguarding the 
interest and promoting the well-being of children as well as integrating and protecting 
marginalized and vulnerable groups. It consists of three sections: (a) Legal Services and 
Child Protection; (b) Community Social Work; and (c) Probation Services.21 The Child 
Protection Unit coordinates and, in collaboration with the Family Squad of the Seychelles 
Police and other partners, investigates, all child abuse cases, including those involving 
sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. It also provides counselling services for abused 
children and their families.22 Social workers from the Community Social Work Section<b> </b>deal 
with cases of domestic violence, substance abuse, mental health, placement, anti-social 
behaviour, teenage pregnancy and neglect. Cases are identified through their regular visits 
to schools, health centres and police stations as well as the Department&#8217;s 24-hour children&#8217;s 
helpline.23 The majority of victims are identified by clients who walk in at headquarters or 
at the district administration offices where the social workers are based. However, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that no cases of trafficking in persons have ever been 
identified. 
</p>
<p>30. The Labour Relations Division within the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource 
Development<b> </b>promotes and maintains industrial peace and stability by providing a legal 
framework to balance the interests of employers and workers.24 It investigates claims and 
complaints relating to salary matters, unfair termination, redundancy and other terms and 
conditions of employment in respect of all workers other than domestic workers, military 
personnel, and civil servants. The Labour Monitoring and Compliance Section conducts 
labour inspections. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in the 1,136 labour 
inspections conducted in 2012, no case of labour exploitation was uncovered in any sector. 
The Employment Services Bureau under the Ministry monitors the activities of licensed 
employment agencies, which are themselves regulated by law.25

<p>31. Moreover, within the Seychelles Police, the Family Squad investigates crimes 
related to child abuse; the Special Tourism Team investigates suspicious transactions and 
anti-social behaviours involving tourists and residents on the beach and the INTERPOL 
National Central Bureau assists local police forces in investigations requiring international 
outreach. The newly established Financial Intelligence and Assets Recovery Unit identifies 
and investigates suspected assets which derive from criminal conduct.26 
</p>
<p>32. The National Human Rights Commission was established on January 2009 with a 
mandate to ensure better protection and promotion of human rights in Seychelles.27 The 
Commission is entitled to, inter alia, inquire into human rights complaints, visit places of 
detention and recommend action to alleviate the factors that inhibit the enjoyment of human 
rights.28 While the Commission could potentially play an instrumental role in addressing 
trafficking issues, including through reviewing complaints, conducting research and 
engaging in awareness-raising campaigns, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 
limited human capacity and the low budget allotted to this institution would have a negative 
impact on its independence and activities. 
</p>
<p>33. Challenges in the Seychelles strategy to combat trafficking in persons include the 
absence of a specific structure with adequate human and financial capacities, as well as 
defined responsibilities to address the phenomenon in a coordinated manner. This impacts 
the provision of effective remedies to victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>34. To date, no victim of trafficking has been officially identified in Seychelles in spite 
of reported cases of possible trafficking in persons, primarily linked with migrant workers, 
and the fact that tourism remains one of the country&#8217;s main industries. The Government 
asserts that this reflects the low level of trafficking into Seychelles, citing its small size, 
remote location and the absence of any shared land borders as dissuasive factors. However, 
information received indicate that foreign women and girls identified as prohibited 
immigrants are reportedly detained and summarily deported directly from the airport by 
immigration officials on suspicion of prostitution. In most cases, there is no identification 
process or proper assessment as to whether they were trafficked or whether their return 
would be safe. It is further alleged that the police are not informed about such cases until 
after the potential victims have left the country. Such lack of coordination in the process of 
identification of potential victims between immigration and police officials is a further 
cause of concern.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts of labour inspectors, particularly 
regarding migrant workers in the construction and fishing sectors. These include 
conducting unannounced inspections, distribution of leaflets on labour-related complaint 
procedures in various languages, including Chinese and Indian, as well as access for 
victims to the Ministry either in person or via the telephone number of the Labour 
Department, which serves as a de facto hotline during working hours. In addition, the living 
conditions of foreign workers are inspected by health inspectors from the Department of 
Health. Notwithstanding, feedback from some onsite visits conducted by the Special 
Rapporteur suggests that the leaflets may not have been widely distributed, as some of the

<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>migrant workers seemed ignorant of such labour complaints procedures and the receipt of 
information leaflets on the subject.  
</p><p>36. While no case of trafficking in persons has been officially identified, the Special 
Rapporteur learned about a number of complaints made, especially in the construction 
industry, about working and living conditions, including non-payment of salaries and 
retention of passports indicative of the exploitation of foreign migrant workers and possible 
trafficking in person. In addition, the Special Rapporteur points out that the low literacy 
level of some migrant workers may prevent them from reading the information provided in 
the leaflets, even when provided in their own language.  
</p>
<p>37. Additionally, in spite of the increasing number of foreigners engaged in domestic 
work, and allegations of abuse, victims of trafficking for domestic servitude have not been 
identified because of the hidden nature of their work; and the fact that labour inspections 
are not conducted in private homes. At the very least, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
the Immigration Division to use the yearly renewal of Gainful Occupational Permits to 
inquire about the working conditions of this category of workers. 
</p>
<p>38. Identification of victims is further exacerbated by the lack of a clear legal distinction 
between prostitution and internal trafficking for sexual purposes. In this regard, social 
workers at the Department of Social Affairs referred to cases whereby some Seychellois 
men force their girlfriends into prostitution in order to earn money for the couple&#8217;s drug 
addiction. The Department also identified 580 cases of sexual abuse committed on children 
from 2009 to 2013. Unfortunately, neither these nor other similar cases have been correctly 
identified as trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Moreover, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that access to sexual health care for children under the 
age of 18 could only be accessed with an accompanying adult, in spite of the age for sexual 
consent being 15 years. This decreases the chance of identification by health-care 
professionals of children who may be potential victims of trafficking for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>39. In view of this, the Special Rapporteur observes that the absence of identified 
victims may not be indicative of the true extent of the problem of trafficking in the country. 
For a variety of reasons, including apparent lack of capacity of frontline officers, 
appropriate legislation, infrastructure and services designed to facilitate the identification of 
victims of trafficking in persons, victims of trafficking remain unidentified or are identified 
as irregular immigrants and deported without further identification. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Protection of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>40. Once identified as such, trafficked persons should be provided with appropriate care 
and assistance so that they are protected from further exploitation and harm. Regrettably, 
the Special Rapporteur found no infrastructure and services available to victims of 
trafficking in Seychelles. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Non-criminalization of trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p>41. The trafficking cycle cannot be broken without attention to the rights of trafficked 
persons in a non-discriminatory manner. In this regard, the domestic legal framework does 
not provide victims of trafficking with specific protection from further harm or assistance to 
them in achieving full recovery. Nor does it confer victims of trafficking with a special 
status that would exempt them from prosecution for offences relating to irregular entry and 
stay in the Seychelles, engaging in prostitution or in employment without a work permit. 
Moreover, the summary/expedited deportation procedure of irregular immigrants, some of 
whom may potentially be victims of trafficking without access to<b> </b>protection, recovery or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>reintegration services, might perpetuate their victimization. The lack of holding facilities 
for irregular migrants, who are currently and inappropriately kept in police cells or private 
guesthouses with no protection is also a cause for concern.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Shelters 
</b></p>
<p>42. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, there were no shelters or psychosocial 
support specifically intended for victims of trafficking. However, the Social Affairs 
department acts as the regulator and guardian of all children placed in these homes, which 
provide welfare assistance to children in need up to 18 years who are subject to protection 
measures, and children in difficult situations, and assist their reintegration into society. It 
also runs a children&#8217;s telephone hotline for victims of violence.29 Three other homes for 
children for orphans and children in need are run by faith-based organizations. Another is 
under the patronage of the First Lady.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur visited the President&#8217;s Village Children&#8217;s Home, regulated 
by the Social Development Affairs, which had 54 children up to the age of 18 years, 
including infants. The centre provides a family environment for orphans and children 
whose parents are faced with socioeconomic difficulties. This includes educational and 
vocational support, medical and psychosocial services for children. The Special Rapporteur 
notes the overall adequate standard of the facility and services provided. 
</p>
<p>44. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that trafficked persons are falling 
through the protection gap in the absence of shelters specifically designed to accommodate 
and provide protection to them. The existing shelters are inadequate to accommodate 
trafficked persons, some of whom may be foreigners, whose circumstances and needs are 
different from other victims of violence or children at risk of violence. Moreover, the 
absence of protection services dissuades trafficking victims from seeking help and exposes 
them to traffickers, who can act with impunity in the knowledge that their victims have no 
legal recourse or effective remedies.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>45. Preliminary investigation of offences against morality under the Penal Code is 
undertaken by members of the police, who transmit their findings to the Attorney General, 
who prosecutes all criminal cases in court. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges 
that some safeguards have been put in place in the legal framework to protect vulnerable 
witnesses which include in-camera hearings for children and victims of sexual 
exploitation.30 She notes the need for the draft anti-trafficking legislation to extend such 
protection to victims of trafficking before, during and after trial to save them from reprisal, 
attacks, stigmatization and embarrassment. 
</p>
<p>46. A number of factors hamper the effective and swift investigation of trafficking cases 
by the police. While there is no specific legislation on trafficking in persons, the Police 
Commissioner conceded that police officials often lack a comprehensive understanding of 
existing penal laws which could be used to deal with cases of trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>47. A corollary of the absence of such investigation of trafficking cases is the lack of 
prosecution of traffickers. It is hoped that, with the adoption of the draft anti-trafficking 
legislation, authorities will step up efforts to investigate and prosecute traffickers.

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Redress for victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>48. According to international law and standards, States have to provide victims of 
trafficking with access to effective remedies.31 While there is no comprehensive national 
framework for victims&#8217; compensation in Seychelles, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
possibility that victims of trafficking may access compensation through separate civil court 
proceedings provided for in the Civil Code. They may also benefit from the Proceeds of 
Crime (Civil Confiscation) Act, 2008, which provides for confiscation of assets and 
proceeds obtained through criminal conduct. Another important means of redress, 
specifically for victims of labour trafficking, is the recovery of unpaid wages. While not 
specifically intended for victims of trafficking, the Employment Act provides for such 
recovery of wages.  
</p>
<p>49. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the necessity of compensation as an 
important component of effective remedies for trafficked persons, she also notes the 
importance of other components of effective remedies, including restitution, 
recovery/rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantee of non-repetition, as well as access to 
information, legal assistance, and regularization of residency status,32 which are currently 
not available for victims of trafficking in Seychelles.  
</p>
<p>50. In certain circumstances, permanent or temporary residence in itself may be a 
necessary and appropriate form of remedy. This consideration is particularly pertinent in 
cases where irregular immigrants, who may also include trafficked persons, are 
immediately returned to their country of origin and thus put at serious risk of being re-
trafficked to Seychelles or of severe violations of their human rights. Where such risks 
exist, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that trafficked persons should be provided with 
the opportunity to remain in Seychelles on a temporary or permanent basis, as well as with 
appropriate support to be effectively integrated into Seychelles society. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Repatriation and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>51. Repatriation of victims of trafficking in persons is provided for in the Palermo 
Protocol.33 At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Seychelles did not have a 
repatriation and reintegration mechanism for identified victims of trafficking. The practice 
of summary deportation of irregular migrants, who might potentially include victims of 
trafficking, may contribute to their revictimization. 
</p>
<p>52. She was however informed that the draft national anti-trafficking plan of action 
provides for voluntary, safe and dignified return options for all victims of trafficking. In 
this regard, she hopes that the draft plan will go further and spell out procedural safeguards 
for the victims, such as the Government&#8217;s obligations to provide for a recovery and 
reflection period, and alternatives to repatriation to their countries of origin, and the 
carrying out of risk assessments to ensure that their repatriation will not jeopardize their 
safety and security. Reintegration procedures for potential Seychellois victims of trafficking 
in persons upon their return from abroad should also be incorporated in the plan of action.

<p><b> H. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>53. Trafficking in persons is a relatively new phenomenon in Seychelles. The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8217;s attempts at awareness-raising activities 
particularly targeting the interministerial committee. While these activities are useful, they 
remain at an embryonic stage and are not systematic. Moreover, they are not specifically 
tailored to reach out to those most at risk of trafficking,<b> </b>including the migrant population, 
which should be provided with accurate information. 
</p>
<p>54. Public awareness of trafficking in persons through the mass media is widely 
recognized as a key prevention strategy for raising awareness about trafficking, 
appropriately targeting trafficked persons, those at risk of being trafficked or otherwise 
exploited, their employers or workplaces. While the local media&#8217;s sporadic articles have 
somewhat contributed to raising attention to the issue, accurate reporting on trafficking in 
persons remains a challenge.  
</p>
<p>55. In addition, the potential of key institutions such as the Ministries of Tourism 
Employment, Social Affairs and Health; law enforcement authorities, the National Human 
Rights Commission and civil society organizations to contribute to raising awareness about 
and proactively taking measures to discourage trafficking in persons does not seem to be 
fully exploited, as these institutions themselves remain in need of capacity-building on the 
issue of trafficking and the human rights dimension, including the gendered nature of 
human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur further underscores the importance of addressing demand as 
a root cause in prevention strategies, which, in the context of Seychelles, includes demand 
for commercial sex services, drug and substance abuse, and poverty. With regard to the 
emerging demand for exploitative labour of foreign migrants, including domestic workers, 
the Special Rapporteur stresses that the protection of labour rights is essential in reducing 
demand for exploitative labour and in preventing exploitation from occurring in the first 
place. There is also a critical need to raise the awareness of employers and potential 
employers about the labour rights of domestic workers under international human rights 
law and standards. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the existing institutionalized cooperation 
between the Government and civil society organizations through a memorandum of 
understanding aimed at, inter alia, maintaining an effective communications network, 
reducing duplication and maximizing the use of limited resources in areas such as health, 
community development and support for vulnerable groups.34 Civil society organizations 
have taken part in the discussion and validation process of the draft national anti-trafficking 
plan of action. However, she notes the apparent lack of expertise on trafficking in persons 
as well as adequate human and financial resources in civil society organizations to address 
the issue. She further echoes the strong need expressed by civil society organizations for 
technical cooperation and assistance on capacity-building on trafficking in persons.

</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 2. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>58. The transnational nature of trafficking requires the participation of source, transit 
and destination countries in anti-trafficking work, including in the area of identification of 
victims, exchange of information, joint investigations and judicial cooperation. While 
promoting cooperation in order to address trafficking in persons is not reflected in the 
domestic legislation, it has been part of the political statements of the Government. At the 
time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, Seychelles had no international, regional or 
bilateral agreements with source countries. Factors that contribute to absence of such 
agreements include lack of awareness of the issues related to trafficking in persons on the 
part of both consular officers and victims themselves; and the fact that not all source 
countries have representations based in Seychelles, as the Special Rapporteur learned.  
</p>
<p>59. Nevertheless, Seychelles has benefited from some technical and financial bilateral or 
multilateral assistance in addressing the issue of trafficking. Assistance provided includes 
the development of a national plan of action, reviewing existing laws, facilitation of 
workshops and sensitization on trafficking in persons undertaken with the support of IOM 
and UNODC. While not directly involved with trafficking in persons, Seychelles also 
cooperates with the Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecutions Intelligence Coordination Center 
(RAPPIC), a joint investigative body created by virtue of article 19 of the United Nations 
Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, for the purposes of tackling and 
prosecuting organized crime threats such as maritime piracy. In this regard, Seychelles has 
collaborated with Kenya, Tanzania, and Mauritius as well as with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and the Naval Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS), INTERPOL, 
Europol, UNODC, the Indian Ocean Commission, and a wide range of European police 
forces.35 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Seychelles has expressed its commitment and resolve to combat trafficking in 
persons, as reflected by the country&#8217;s ratification of the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime, and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (Palermo Protocol) as 
well as through the ratification of other major international and regional human 
rights instruments and the issuance of a standing invitation to special procedures 
mandate holders. The political commitment to end human trafficking clearly exists in 
Seychelles, as reflected in the establishment of the National Anti-Trafficking 
Committee. Legislative changes and policy measures to combat trafficking in persons 
are also envisaged by the Government through the drafting of an anti-trafficking bill 
and a national plan of action to combat trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur nonetheless remains concerned at the absence of legal 
and policy frameworks to prevent and combat trafficking in persons. Consequently, 
human trafficking is not an offence which makes it difficult to prosecute and punish 
traffickers. Moreover, despite existing penalties for offences against liberty and 
morality, there is no evidence that these have been used to identify victims of

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking nor that anyone has been convicted for acts relating to trafficking in 
persons.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>There is also a lack of targeted policies and institutions to deal with trafficking 
in persons, appropriate procedures for the identification of victims of trafficking and 
mechanisms for data collection. Such a situation makes it impossible to conduct 
proper investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Moreover, victims of trafficking are not provided with comprehensive support. 
The absence of shelters and psycho-social supports for victims of gender-based 
violence, including trafficking, perpetuates their victimization. There are no holding 
facilities for irregular migrants, who are currently and inappropriately kept in police 
cells. The speed with which prohibited migrants are deported may not allow for 
thorough investigations and possible identification of trafficked persons and 
traffickers. Labour inspections are limited by resources to effectively overseeing 
businesses. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>While there have been sporadic attempts at awareness-raising for members of 
the Inter-Ministerial Committee, efforts to prevent and combat human trafficking 
remain at an embryonic stage and are not systematic. The general population, civil 
society and institutions for the protection of human rights remain mostly unaware and 
uninformed of the issue of trafficking and its human rights implications.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>As a result, the potential scale of the problem of trafficking in persons, its 
trends and scope appears to be somewhat underestimated and unknown in the 
absence of statistical information on trafficking in persons.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>In view of the above observations, and in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue, 
the Special Rapporteur offers the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>With regard to the legal and policy frameworks, Seychelles should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure full implementation of the Palermo Protocol, which requires 
Seychelles to take effective and comprehensive measures to prevent and combat 
trafficking in persons and accelerate the process of developing and adopting the draft 
anti-trafficking legislation. In particular, this legislation should clearly define and 
criminalize trafficking in persons offences in accordance with article 3 of the Palermo 
Protocol&#8217;s definition and classification of trafficking crimes. It should further 
prescribe sufficiently stringent punishments for perpetrators as well as provide 
effective remedies for victims of trafficking.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Extend the scope of existing labour laws to ensure adequate protection 
for the rights of domestic workers. Labour inspectors should be given the power and 
means to monitor the working conditions of domestic workers, who are often the most 
vulnerable to trafficking.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Accelerate, in consultation with all stakeholders, the adoption of the 
national action plan to combat trafficking based on a human rights- and victim-
centred approach, and allocate an adequate budget for its implementation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Carry out a national baseline study to collect data on trends, forms and 
manifestation of trafficking, its causes and consequences. This survey should be 
carried out in collaboration with research institution and in close cooperation with 
international organizations, civil society organizations and faith-based organizations.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(e) Enhanced coordination and efforts at combating trafficking would be 
better achieved if an office of an independent national rapporteur or an equivalent 
mechanism were created by law and charged with the responsibility to implement, 
monitor and evaluate activities aimed at combating human trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>With regard to institutional frameworks, Seychelles should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Accelerate the establishment of the National Anti-Trafficking Committee 
by law as the lead agency to combat and prevent trafficking in persons. It should 
ensure that this body is endowed with the responsibility to coordinate, implement, 
monitor and evaluate activities and initiatives aimed at combating all types of human 
trafficking.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Given the absence of reliable data on trafficking, there is an urgent need 
to design a mechanism for the collection of data on cases of trafficking, as well as on 
the forms, trends and manifestations of trafficking. Such data is vital to the 
development of informed policy responses to address trafficking in persons.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>With regard to identification, training and capacity-building, Seychelles 
should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Put in place an adequate and well-resourced system with specific tools 
and protocols for identifying victims of trafficking. It is pertinent to note that accurate 
and swift identification of victims of trafficking is crucial to activate other actions, 
such as investigation and prosecution of traffickers, as well as referrals that would 
allow for adequate assistance and protection of victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Provide comprehensive training programmes with support from 
interested partners, including donor organizations and other governments to enhance 
knowledge and awareness on human trafficking for all stakeholders, especially the 
police, the People&#8217;s Defence force, immigration and border agents, prosecutors, judges 
and lawyers, as well as labour and health inspectors. Furthermore, it should enhance 
the skills of civil society organizations, including all stakeholders involved in providing 
assistance and care to victims of trafficking. It should also build the capacity of the 
media on effective reporting on trafficking in persons.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>With regard to the support services for victims of trafficking, Seychelles 
should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Make greater efforts to protect and assist all victims of trafficking, with 
full respect for their human rights. It should create and support adequately resourced 
programmes and institutions to provide short- and long-term assistance to victims of 
trafficking.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Put in place a free 24 hour confidential hotline/helpline for reporting 
suspected cases of trafficking and exploitation of migrant workers. This should also be 
accessible to foreign victims of trafficking and serviced by multilingual staff who have 
received specialized training on trafficking in persons.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Establish a comprehensive and non-discriminatory compensation 
scheme for victims of trafficking at the national level, including a common fund for 
victims of trafficking in the event of the insolvency of the perpetrators. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Maintain close cooperation with the United Nations system, especially 
UNODC and IOM, for the identification and the safe return of trafficked victims to 
their country, having due regard to the need, if any, for international protection of 
victims. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Strengthen the National Human Rights Commission and provide 
funding that will enhance its effectiveness in accordance with the Paris Principles.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>With regard to prevention, Seychelles should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> <b>Step up efforts to raise awareness about all forms of trafficking in 
persons, including for domestic servitude, forced labour and sexual exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Launch widespread awareness-raising campaigns using media, 
information and communication technology, and other channels of communication 
that may appeal to the relevant communities in order to send a strong message and 
promote deeper understanding of what constitutes trafficking among the general 
population and the foreign community based in Seychelles. In this regard, all islands 
should be sensitized and efforts should not be concentrated in the capital city alone. 
Furthermore, efforts should be directed through the Ministry of Tourism and Culture 
and the tourism board to inform tourists and other stakeholders in the tourism 
industry about the zero tolerance policy of the Government and the international 
community in fighting human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In addition to legal and policy action to combat trafficking in persons, 
take concurrent measures to address the root causes of the problem, including 
demand for commercial sexual activities, demand for unskilled labour in the 
construction and fishery sectors and domestic work; as well as drug and substance 
dependence. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>With regard to prosecution, Seychelles should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Increase its efforts to prosecute traffickers while guaranteeing fair trial 
rights consistent with a human rights-based approach to criminal justice, and 
establish the necessary legal framework and procedures in order to ensure that 
victims of trafficking and witnesses are protected.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Once the anti-trafficking law is in place the Government should, through 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and the Supreme Courts, build the capacity of 
prosecutors, State counsels and judges, focusing on a human rights-based approach to 
prosecution of trafficking cases, including provision of effective remedies for victims 
of trafficking. In this regard, technical assistance may be sought from relevant United 
Nations agencies and States.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>With regard to the international, regional and bilateral frameworks, Seychelles 
should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify without delay ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning decent 
work for domestic workers and the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and other relevant 
ILO Conventions against forced labour and exploitation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Strengthen partnerships with source countries in the region and 
cooperation, including through international, regional and bilateral agreements, in 
order to facilitate swift and coordinated responses, including through exchange of 
information, mutual legal assistance and safe returns. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Recognize the need for a foreign workforce and develop safe migration 
pathways for semi-skilled and unskilled workers by entering into bilateral agreements 
with countries of origin and ensuring that unscrupulous recruitment agencies do not 
take undue advantage of migrant workers in search of a livelihood. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The contribution of, and collaboration with civil society organizations, 
are crucial in the fight against human trafficking. In this regard, immediate steps </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>should be taken to establish the necessary framework to enable civil society 
organizations to provide assistance, including shelter and counselling services to 
victims.
