1.0  Summary  
 
This report covers the update to the Hermosa (previously Hardshell) mineral resource presented 
in  the  Wildcat  Silver  Inc.  (Wildcat)  press  release  dated  February  6,  2012  and  prepared  by 
Independent  Mining  Consultants,  Inc.  (IMC).    The  previous  Hermosa  mineral  resource  is 
contained in the Preliminary Economic Assessment Study titled “Hardshell Project – Preliminary 
Economic Assessment – Santa Cruz County, Arizona”, dated 26 October 2010 (referred to as the 
October 2010 PEA).  The resource reported in the PEA at a $55/ton recovered value cutoff is 6.6 
million tons of indicated oxide mineral resource plus 43.3 million tons of inferred oxide and 7.7 
million tons of inferred sulfide mineral resource.  These mineral resources are based on 88 drill 
holes (41 core, 46 rotary hammer and one reverse circulation) for a total of approximately 58,500 
feet of drilling. 
 
Portions of the October 2010 PEA are included in this report to present the level of study on the 
project.  When appropriate, additional information has been added to the report sections where 
new information has been developed since the October 2010 PEA.
1.1  2012 Mineral Resource 
 
The current mineral resource estimate is based on 216 drill holes (49 core, 10 rotary-core, 82 
rotary  and  75  reverse  circulation)  for  a  total  of  150,702  feet  of  drilling.    This  increase  in  the 
amount of drill information plus the additional geologic knowledge on the manto, deep sulfide 
and the new Upper Silver Zone deposits warranted an update to the mineral resource estimate.   
 
The mineral resource is developed using a block model with a block size of 50 x 50 feet (ft) in 
plan and 20 ft vertically.  All tonnages are reported in short tons (tons) which equal 2,000 pounds 
per ton.  The silver, manganese, zinc, copper and lead grades are estimated from 216 drill holes 
comprising  150,702  feet  of  drill  length  using  an  inverse  distance  to  the  5th  power  estimation 
procedure.  The basis for the selection of this estimation procedure is discussed in Section 14. 
 
The  Hermosa  mineral  resources  are  tabulated  within  open  pit  geometry  for  the  manto,  Upper 
Silver Zone and portions of the skarn zone based on estimates of costs, metal recoveries and the 
following metal prices:  $25.76/oz silver, $0.60/lb manganese, $0.93/lb zinc and $3.21/lb copper.  
The potential underground resource below the pit mineral resource is defined as a contiguous 
geometry above a $55 value per ton cutoff grade.  Both of these approaches meet the criteria that 
a  mineral  resource  estimate  has  a  ‘reasonable  prospect  for  economic  extraction’.  The  mineral 
resource  estimate  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  Canadian  Ni  43-101  standards  and  CIM 
definitions of resource classification. Table 1-1 is a summary of the mineral resource tonnage.

•  Complete the current drill program on the patented claims, expected completion in April
2011.
•  Update the mineral resource estimate based on the drilling completed between September
•  Begin the permitting process for a drill program on the US Forest Service (USFS)
15, 2011 and end of April 2012.
unpatented claims.
•  Begin environmental background and monitoring programs. 
•  Continue metallurgical test programs for both the Manto and Upper Silver Zones. 
•  Do some additional drilling in the Manto Zone and Upper Silver Zone to improve the
classification confidence (indicated to measured).
•  Follow up with Lynda Bloom’s recommendation to review lab procedures.
Wildcat has a budget of US$12 million to drill 180,000 feet during late 2012 through 2013 on the 
unpatented claims.  This drilling will test new targets and expand the Upper Silver Zone mineral 
resource.  This work will depend on receiving drill permits from the USFS. 
 
Once the mineral resource is updated with drill data from the soon to be completed mineral 
resource, an updated evaluation of the project should be done which will potentially lead to an 
updated PEA or prefeasibility study.

Property Description and Location
Wildcat Silver Inc. 
Hermosa 2012 Mineral Resource 
 
1.3 
 
The  Hermosa  (formerly  “Hardshell”)  Property  is  part  of  the  Harshaw  and  Patagonia  Mining 
Districts  located  in  the  Patagonia  Mountains  of  Santa  Cruz  County,  Arizona  (Figure  1.1-1). 
Hermosa  is  located  six  miles  southeast  of  the  town  of  Patagonia,  which  has  a  population  of 
approximately 1,000 people.  
 
This report uses the official Arizona State Plane Coordinate system; NAD 83; Central zone; in 
international feet. 
 
The property is located 15 miles northeast of the Santa Cruz county seat at Nogales and 50 miles 
southeast  of  the  nearest  large  commercial  center  of  Tucson,  in  adjacent  Pima  County.  The 
international border with the State of Sonora, Mexico is eight miles to the south. The property 
covers about 2.6 miles in a north-south direction and about 3.0 miles in an east-west direction. 
 
The property is within Sections 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 16 of Township 23 South, Range 
16 East, G&SR BLM General property coordinates are 31° 28’ North latitude and 110° 43’ West 
longitude.  
 
1.4  Mineral Tenure 
 
The WCS holdings now consist of 8 patented lode mining claims totalling about 154 acres with 
the  surface  and  mineral  rights  owned  fee  simple.  The  patented  land  is  surrounded  by  251 
contiguous  “Shell”  unpatented  lode  mining  claims  totalling  approximately  4,723  acres.  Under 
the terms of United States mining law, the unpatented mining claims can be held as long as the 
annual  federal  maintenance  fee  is  paid  (no  expiration  date).  Data  on  the  individual  claims  is 
shown in Table 6.4-1 (Patented Claims) and Appendix B (Unpatented Claims) to this report. 
 
 
 
The Hermosa deposit is a manto style silver, manganese, lead, zinc replacement which occurs at 
the  contact  of  the  Paleozoic  limestones  and  the  overlying  Cretaceous  sediments.    Additional 
silver  mineralization  occurs  higher  up  in  the  Cretaceous  volcanics  associated  with  very  low 
levels of base metals. The mineralization occurs as carbonate replacement, veinlets, and fault – 
fracture infills.  Pre-mineral structures are important in localizing the mineralization while post 
mineralization faulting is important in displacing it.

1.5  Mining, Exploration and Sampling 
 
The  Hermosa  (Hardshell)  deposit  was  discovered  in  1879  and  in  addition  to  other  similar 
deposits  in  the  area,  they  were  intermittently  mined  to  1964.    Production  for  the  Hardshell 
Incline Mine (a separate upper lead-silver oxidized mineral horizon with subordinate manganese 
oxides)  and  adjoining  areas  has  amount  to  35,000  tons,  with  an  average  grade  of  about  eight 
ounces  of  silver  per  ton.    ASARCO  conducted  intermittent  exploration  of  the  Hardshell  area 
between 1940 and 1991.  Arizona Minerals, of  which Wildcat Silver Corporation (WSC) is a 
majority owner, acquired the property from ASARCO in 2006.   
From the mid-1950s to 1991, ASARCO drilled 114 air-hammer and core holes with an aggregate 
length  of  46,000  feet  (14,000  meters)  on  the  property.    Drill  logs  and  assay  data  sheets  were 
available  for  all  114  holes.    Drill  hole  coordinates,  sample  intervals  and  assays  have  been 
complied for these holes into a computer database by WSC.   
 
Most core was split with one half preserved for reference.  Reference portions of chips produced 
by  air-hammer  drilling  were  preserved.    Samples  were  analyzed  for  silver  by  fire  assay  with 
manganese, zinc and copper by wet chemical or atomic adsorption methods or subsequent XRF 
methods by ASARCO.

WSC  re-assayed  all  available  pulps  remaining  from  ASARCO  laboratory  analysis  for  silver, 
gold, manganese, zinc and copper.  Comparison showed similar values.  The grade values were 
incorporated  into  the  drillhole  database,  giving  preference  to  the  newer  assays  and  using  the 
older assays only when older reference pulps were not available for re-assay. 
 
WSC’s activity on the property during 2006 – 2010 included the staking of 140 additional lode 
mining  claims,  surface  mapping  and  the  rehabilitation  of  roads  in  the  area,  and  three  drill 
programs.  In 2007 four core holes totalling 4,450 feet were completed for comparison with 4 
previously  drilled  ASARCO  rotary  air-hammer  drill  holes.    In  2007  and  2008,  three  deep 
exploration core holes, totalling 7,928 feet, tested a potential northwest extension of the Main 
Manto  Zone  mineralization  along  the  Hogan  Fault  Zone.  In  2009,  a  follow  up  of  positive 
exploration results was undertaken with 6 deep core holes (12,005 feet) sited in and peripheral to 
the  Hogan  Fault  Zone.  These  holes  were  located  to  test  the  down-dip  projection  of  the  Main 
Manto Zone.  The results of the work through early 2010 resulted in a mineral resource update 
and the development of the October 2010 PEA report by M3 Engineering and Technology. 
 
Beginning in December 2010 up to five drill rigs, including 3 reverse circulation and 2 diamond 
core rigs, were used to complete the planned drilling program.  The reverse circulation rigs were 
used primarily to test the shallow targets (< 800 feet) while the core drills were used to test the 
deeper  (>800  feet)  portions  of  the  mineralized  system.    Drilling  through  September  15,  2011 
included 95 holes totalling 81,387 feet.  In October 2011, drilling results and assays were merged 
into the existing Hermosa database in order to complete an update of the resource contained at 
Hermosa.  Rock codes were updated to reflect a better understanding of the ore types as well as 
updating classifications of the rock types.  The completed database, including wireframes, was 
delivered to Independent Mining Consultants (IMC) of Tucson to update the Hermosa mineral 
resource. 
 
In 2010, 85 lode mining claims (1,623 acres) were staked extending the eastern margin of the 
claim  block.    These  claims  were  staked  by  a  certified  surveyor,  Darling  and  Company,  from 
Tucson.    The  additional  claims  were  filed  with  both  the  federal  and  county  governments  in 
November 2011.

WSC intends to develop the Hermosa property in southern Arizona for silver, copper, zinc, and 
manganese production. To-date metallurgical tests have been limited to bench-scale testing of 
both the Manto and Upper Silver Zone leach ores.  Through this testing, a flow sheet has been 
developed that will treat the Hermosa ores with acceptable recoveries and costs as presented in 
the October 2010 PEA.  The flow sheet developed for that study included conventional three 
stage crushing followed by grinding in a ball mill.  Ground ore is first leached with SO2 and 
sulfuric acid to solubilize manganese, copper and zinc.  Acid leach thickener overflow proceeds 
to  copper  removal,  iron  removal,  zinc  solvent  extraction(SX)  and  electrowinning  (EW),  and 
manganese  carbonate  precipitation.    The  acid  leach  underflow  is  conditioned  with  line  to  pH 
greater than 10.5 and leach with cyanide to free silver.  Pregnant leach solution is treated by the 
Merrill Crowe process followed by filtration and smelting/refining to produce a silver dore.

However,  until  current  metallurgical  testwork  to  optimize  the  processing  flow  sheet  is 
completed and a pilot plant has been successfully operated, it is premature to publish a more 
detailed processing plant description. 
 
1.7 
 
Currently WSC is in the advanced exploration stage on the Hermosa Project.  To-date all WSC 
drilling has been confined to lands owned fee simple by the Company.  Extreme care has been 
taken  to  follow  all  applicable  state  and  federal  laws  that  apply  to  exploration  drilling  and  the 
abandonment and reclamation of roads, drill pads and drill holes. 
 
All  drill  holes,  excepting  those  used  for  monitor  wells,  have  been  abandoned  according  to 
guidelines set by the state of Arizona.  Plastic-lined sumps used to catch drill cuttings have been 
abandoned  appropriately  by  disposing  of  the  cuttings  and  filling  the  sumps  with  soil  with 
subsequent recontouring and seeding.  Abandoned access roads and drill spurs will be reclaimed 
as  the  current  program  comes  to  a  close  in  April.    These  roads  will  be  brought  to  original 
contour, be water barred for erosion and then reseeded with natural vegetation as recommended 
by the Coronado National Forest. 
 
As the project moves forward, WSC will begin the permitting process required to start mining 
operations.    During  2012,  this  will  begin  with  environmental  baseline  studies  and  monitoring 
programs.  A discussion of required permits is included in Section 20 and Appendix D lists the 
required permits.

2.0 
 
This report covers the update to the Hermosa (previously Hardshell) mineral resource presented 
in  the  Wildcat  Silver  Inc.  (Wildcat)  press  release  dated  February  6,  2012  and  prepared  by 
Independent  Mining  Consultants,  Inc.  (IMC).    The  previous  Hermosa  mineral  resource  is 
contained in the Preliminary Economic Assessment Study titled “Hardshell Project – Preliminary 
Economic Assessment – Santa Cruz County, Arizona”, dated 26 October 2010 (referred to as the 
October 2010 PEA).  The resource reported in the PEA at a $55/ton recovered value cutoff is 6.6 
million tons of indicated oxide mineral resource plus 43.3 million tons of inferred oxide and 7.7 
million tons of inferred sulfide mineral resource.  These mineral resources are based on 88 drill 
holes (41 core, 46 rotary hammer and one reverse circulation) for a total of approximately 58,500 
feet of drilling. 
 
The current mineral resource estimate is based on 216 drill holes (49 core, 10 rotary-core, 82 
rotary  and  75  reverse  circulation)  for  a  total  of  150,702  feet  of  drilling.    This  increase  in  the 
amount of drill information plus the additional geologic knowledge on the manto, deep sulfide 
and the new Upper Silver Zone deposits warranted an update to the mineral resource estimate. 
 
Portions of the October 2010 PEA are included in this report to present the level of study on the 
project.  When appropriate, additional information has been added to the report sections where 
new information has been developed since the October 2010 PEA. 
 
2.1 
 
Herb Welhener (QP for  the mineral resource update) visited the Hermosa Project on May 19, 
2011.  During the site visit, he toured the property, observed drilling operations, reviewed the 
core logging procedures and data collection.  No independent samples were taken.

4.2 Property Description 
The Hermosa Project is located in the northern end of the Patagonia Mountains. Elevations on 
the  property  range  from  4,900  to  6,200  feet  above  sea  level.    The  area  is  sparsely  populated. 
Livestock  grazing  is  the  dominant  land  use.  The  property  is  located  within  the  USFS  Farrell 
Grazing Allotment.  
 
The core of the property is comprised of 154 acres of fee simple ownership (surface and mineral 
rights) that evolved from historic mining claims patented in the 19th century.  
 
Most  of  the  surrounding  property,  the  unpatented  claims  held  by  Wildcat  Silver  Inc.  and  the 
Farrell Grazing Allotment, are Federal lands administered by the US Department of Agriculture, 
National Forest System, in the Sierra Vista Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest.  
 
The  property  contains  remnants  of  historic  mining  and  exploration  activity  including  shafts, 
trenches and other surface openings.  Access to the area is easily achieved through a series of 
interconnecting  two  track,  low  maintenance  roads  and  primitive trails. The  roads  are  used  for 
recreation and access to property and mining claims.
4.3 Property Ownership 
 
The Hermosa Property is owned outright by Arizona Minerals, Inc., a Nevada Corporation which 
was  registered  on  October  4,  2005  with  the  Arizona  Corporation  Commission  to  do  business 
within the State of Arizona. On October 28, 2005, Arizona Minerals entered into an agreement 
with ASARCO, LLC to purchase the Hermosa Property. At that time, the property consisted of 
eight patented claims in three separate tax parcels acquired by a combination of patents in 1961 
and purchase in 1968 and 1978; in addition, 26 unpatented “Shell No.” lode claims located in 
1965 and 1968 by American Smelting and Refining Company. American Smelting and Refining 
Company later changed its name to ASARCO, Inc. and was subsequently merged into ASARCO 
LLC.  On  February  17,  2006,  the  US  Bankruptcy  Court,  Southern  District  of  Texas,  Corpus 
Christi Division in Case 05-21207 approved the sale of the Hardshell Group of Mining Claims 
by ASARCO, LLC to Arizona Minerals, Inc. This acquisition closed on March 14, 2006, with 
the final payment made to ASARCO, LLC on March 14, 2007. Arizona Minerals has no royalty 
or other obligations due ASARCO, LLC or any predecessor claim owners. 
 
As  part  of  the  purchase  agreement  with  ASARCO,  LLC,  Arizona  Minerals  also  acquired  all 
available  originals  or  copies  of  data  pertaining  to  the  property  including  information  on  land, 
geology,  previous  drilling,  assays,  engineering,  groundwater  and  metallurgical  studies.    Also 
transferred to Wildcat Silver were the remaining drill core, samples and assay pulps. 
 
Wildcat  Silver  Corporation,  a  Canadian  Public  Company,  has  an  80  percent  stock  interest  in 
Arizona Minerals, Inc. Diamond Hill Investment Company, a private Canadian concern holds the 
remaining 20 percent of the shares of Arizona Minerals, Inc. Wildcat Silver Corporation is the 
operating  company  for  the  Hermosa  Property  and  has  been  in  charge  of  operation  and

4.4 Mineral Tenure 
The Hermosa Property consists of mining claims located in the Harshaw and Patagonia Mining 
Districts.  The property purchased from ASARCO, LLC included 8 patented and 26 unpatented 
lode mining claims. The Title to Mineral Rights is vested in WSC’s majority-owned subsidiary 
Arizona Minerals Inc. A map of the claims is shown as Figure 4.4-1. 
 
Arizona Minerals located an additional 44 lode claims (about 909 acres) surrounding the original 
26 unpatented claims in December 2006 and January 2007. In April and May 2007 an additional 
77 lode claims (about 1,447 acres) were staked by Arizona Minerals, to the east toward the San 
Rafael  Valley,  and  south  to  the  Mowry  Mining  Camp.  In  2008,  four  additional  claims  were 
staked  to  cover  orphan  fractions  around  the  core  patented  claims,  one  unnecessary  claim 
dropped,  and  44  claims  were  amended  at  the  recommendation  of  the  BLM  to  cover  slight 
imperfections  in  the  descriptions  of  the  quarter  sections  in  this  non-standard  unsurveyed-
protracted township. An additional 16 claims (about 330 acres) were staked in September 2008 
to complete the NE corner of the claim block.  In November 2011 an additional 85 claims (1,623 
acres) were staked on the east side of the WCS claim block. This brings the total unpatented lode 
claims  on  surface  lands  of  the  Coronado  National  Forest  held  by  WCS  to  251  totalling 
approximately 4,723 acres. 
 
The WCS holdings now consist of 8 patented lode mining claims totalling about 154 acres with 
the  surface  and  mineral  rights  owned  fee  simple.  The  patented  land  is  surrounded  by  251 
contiguous  “Shell”  unpatented  lode  mining  claims  totalling  approximately  4,723  acres.  Under 
the terms of United States mining law, the unpatented mining claims can be held as long as the 
annual  federal  maintenance  fee  is  paid  (no  expiration  date).  Data  on  the  individual  claims  is 
shown in Table 4.4-1 (Patented Claims) and Appendix B (Unpatented Claims) to this report. 
 
WSC contracted a registered land surveyor, Darling Environmental  & Surveying  (Darling), to 
complete  a  Record  of  Survey  (new  corner  pins  reset  where  necessary)  for  all  eight  patented 
claims. This was done, in part, to  assist USFS and BLM in accurately reflecting the patented 
claims  on  government  working  maps.    The  Record  of  Survey  was  filed  with  the  Santa  Cruz 
County  Recorder  and  has  become  part  of  the  Official  Title  Record.  The  patented  claim 
boundaries  have  been  brushed  and  flagged  by  WSC  to  help  better  identify  the  boundaries. 
Unpatented  claim  boundaries  were  also  checked  or  established  (new  claims)  by  Darling.  Old 
unpatented claim corners were checked and new unpatented corners set, both using GPS survey 
methods by Darling. Highly-accurate differential GPS was used for the patent Record of Survey 
and primary control for the unpatented claims. Hand-held GPS and compass line-of sight was 
used  for secondary  work  on  the  May  2007  unpatented  claims.  The  last  16  claims  staked  in 
September  2008  by  Arizona  Minerals  used  compass  and  tape  survey  methods  starting  from 
previous GPS corners. 
 
The  wholly-owned,  patented  land  parcels  with  full  surface  and  mineral  rights  have  annual 
payments  of  property  taxes  due  to  Santa  Cruz  County,  Arizona  who  regulate  land  usage  by
March 2012

zoning  and  other  laws.  The  mineral  rights  for  the  unpatented  mining  claims  are  held  by  the 
annual payment of maintenance fees to the US Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of 
Interior for each claim. The receipt (Notice of  Intent to Hold) for the payment of these  BLM 
maintenance fees is also filed with the Santa Cruz County Recorder annually.  Under the terms 
of the United States mining law, the unpatented claims can be held as long as the annual Federal 
maintenance fee is paid to the BLM (no expiration date). The surface rights of the unpatented 
mining  claims  are  administered  by  the  US  Forest  Service  under  multiple-use  regulatory 
provisions. 
 
John C. Lacy, attorney-at-law of the firm DeConcini, McDonald, Yetwin & Lacy, PC issued a 
50-page Title Report, dated June 19, 2006. He found both patented and unpatented claims to be 
valid as of the date of the opinion, and that the necessary assessment work and annual payments 
for maintenance had been completed since before and after the federal BLM legal assessment 
changes  of  August  31,  1993  back  to  the  origin  of  the  claims.  All  taxes  and  other  recording 
requirements with Santa Cruz County were also in order. In an updated 54-page Title Opinion of 
May 6, 2008, John C. Lacy stated that the surface and mineral estates of the eight patented and 
147  unpatented  claims  of  Arizona  Minerals,  Inc.  were  still  in  order  and  that  all  required 
payments and taxes to the US BLM and Santa Cruz County had been made to date. Taxes due to 
Santa  Cruz  County  for  the  three  patented  parcels  have  been  paid  to  date.  Nineteen  (19) 
unpatented claims were staked and recorded subsequent to Mr. Lacy’s report. 
 
Maintenance fees have  been paid to the BLM for all unpatented claims through September 1, 
2012.  All  mineral  resources  disclosed  in  this  report  are  fully  contained  within  the  property 
boundaries as described above.

Arizona Minerals has granted a grazing lease to the Hale Family Revocable Trust doing business 
as (dba) the Hale Ranch on the 154 patented acres in cooperation with the US Forest Service, 
Sierra  Vista  Ranger  District.    This  arrangement  is  a  continuation  of  a  similar  lease  that  had 
existed between the Hale Ranch and ASARCO LLC since 1966. The Hermosa Deposit is under 
the American Peak Pasturage of the Farrell Grazing Allotment from the USFS to the Hale Ranch. 
Range Management on the unpatented ground is supervised by the USFS. Some arrangements 
will be required with the Hale Ranch/USFS Farrell Grazing Allotment for loss of grazing areas 
on the American Peak pasturage during mine production. 
 
Santa Cruz County has a 66-foot wide road easement centered on the Harshaw Road (USFS CNF 
Road  No.  49).  About  400  feet  of  the  Harshaw  Road  crosses  the  northwest  end  of  the  Alta 
patented  ground,  where  an  access  road  to  the  property  is  located.  The  local  power  company, 
UniSource  Energy  Services,  also  has  a  high  voltage  power  line  with  easements  along  the 
Harshaw  Road,  through  the  Alta  patented  claim.  A  branch  of  this  power  line  also  extends 
through  the  Harshaw  town  site  owned  by  the  Hale  Ranch  and  continues  into  the  San  Rafael 
Valley.

5.0  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography
5.1
Access
The  Hermosa  Property  is  located  about  50  miles  southeast  of  Tucson,  Arizona  and  15  miles 
northeast  of  Nogales,  Arizona.  The  property  is  located  eight  miles  north  of  the  international 
border with the state of Sonora, Mexico, in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. Access to the property 
is  either  from  Tucson  or  Nogales  to  the  town  of  Patagonia.  From  Patagonia,  a  county  road, 
mostly paved, leads six miles to the former town site of Harshaw.  An interconnecting system of 
USFS-numbered  road  network,  originally  constructed  largely  for  exploration,  mining  and 
ranching exists around Harshaw and the district, but only major arteries are maintained by the 
county. The property extends southward for about two miles from Harshaw. Access around the 
property is by low maintenance two track roads, some of which have been used since the 1870s. 
 
The  property  lies  on  the  eastern  pediment  flank  of  the  Patagonia  Mountains  that  forms  the 
northwestern  edge  of  the  Mexican  Highlands  section  of  the  Basin  and  Range  Physiographic 
Province of the southwestern United States. Elevations in the mountains range up to 7,200 feet 
above sea level, while elevations on the property range from 4,900 to 6,200 feet. The property is 
dominated by the western San Rafael Valley pediment plateau at about 5,400 feet, which onlaps 
to  the  west  the  higher  foothills  of  the  range.  The  plateau  is  deeply  incised  by  tributaries  of 
Harshaw Creek which drain to the north into Sonoita Creek at the Town of Patagonia.
5.2
Climate
The Harshaw-Patagonia area has a semi-arid mountainous climate characteristic of the Arizona 
Uplands.  Temperatures  seldom  remain  above  90°  Fahrenheit  in  the  summer  with  warm  to 
moderately cool nights. Winter days are usually mild with periodic frosts at night. Light snowfall 
is  not  uncommon  but  seldom  remains  for  more  than  a  few  days.  Cooler  temperatures  and 
stronger winds occur at higher elevations in the area. 
 
Precipitation,  characteristic  of  this  upland  desert  region,  is  variable  and  cyclic.  Annual 
precipitation averages 17 inches and ranges from 8 to 36 inches per year with higher amounts of 
precipitation  occurring  at  higher  elevations  in  the  range.  More  than  50  percent  of  the  rainfall 
comes  during  the  period  from  late  June  to  early  October  in  cyclonic,  often  torrential 
“monsoonal” thunderstorms, which are often accompanied by strong, destructive winds.  
 
The operating and construction seasons for the Hermosa Property are year-long.

Infrastructure
Water
Historically,  significant  amounts  of  ground  water  have  been  produced  for  mining  and  milling 
from  the  Harshaw  Creek  drainage  and  the  Hermosa  property  itself  without  diminishing  local

ranch  and  domestic  supplies.  The  local  base  level  of  the  water  table  is  around  4,850  feet 
elevation at Harshaw. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS regularly monitor 
stream  flow  and  water  quality  in  the  district  and  region.    Hermosa  and  the  local  area  of  the 
Harshaw  Creek  drainage  are  not  part  of  an  Arizona  Department  of  Water  Resources  Active 
Management Area. 
 
Available information supports the assumption that adequate water supplies are available within 
a reasonable distance from the property.
5-2
Workforce
Southern Arizona hosts several major mining districts and the local area has several large active 
mines.  Experienced,  skilled  workers  are  readily  available  within  a  reasonable  commuting 
distance.
Commercial Resources and Services
Resources  in  the  town  of  Patagonia  are  limited.  The  town  has  a  high  school,  a  hotel,  several 
restaurants  and  bed  &  breakfasts,  a  small  grocery  store  and  a  gas  station.  The  town  is  not  a 
significant  source  of  supplies  or  services.  Nogales,  20  miles  southwest  of  Patagonia,  is  the 
county seat for Santa Cruz County. With a population of about 20,000, Nogales is large enough 
to serve as a supply and service center for most needs. Nogales has rail freight service, and a 
small commercial airport.  
 
Tucson, just over 65 miles to the north, has historically been the commercial and service/supply 
center  for  one  of  the  world’s  largest  mining  districts.  Tucson  has  a  full-service  commercial 
airport and is a large rail center.
Social Services and Security
Patagonia has K-12 schools and a well-stocked town library.  
 
Patagonia has a small police force which is supplemented by the Santa Cruz County Sherriff and 
the Arizona Highway Patrol to help maintain order.  Additionally, the U.S. Border Patrol has a 
strong presence in the area as drug trafficking and illegal immigration are a concern throughout 
Southern Arizona. 
 
Patagonia  has  a  small  family  medical  facility  and  EMT  service  associated  with  the  Fire 
Department and helicopter landing facilities.  
 
Nogales  has  a  small  regional  hospital.  Serious  cases  are  transported  to  one  of  Tucson’s  large 
hospitals by ambulance or helicopter.

A 13.8 kV power line follows Harshaw Creek from west of Patagonia to the old town site of 
Harshaw and  continues  on to the San Rafael Valley. Higher capacity power lines traverse the 
Sonoita  Creek  Valley  from  Huachuca  City  to  Sonoita-Elgin  and  Patagonia  from  the  east.    A 
major regional natural gas pipeline, owned and operated by El Paso Natural, Gas transports gas 
from Nogales to the northeast in the Sonoita Valley where is tapped for use. A trunk phone line 
(Qwest) follows the Harshaw Creek Road with phone service available in Harshaw. Cell phone 
service is good in the Patagonia-Harshaw area with cell towers on Red Mountain.
Transportation
The  Hermosa  Property  is  located  about  50  miles  southeast  of  Tucson,  Arizona  and  15  miles 
northeast of Nogales, Arizona. Access to the property is either from Tucson or Nogales to the 
town  of  Patagonia  via  state  maintained  hard  surfaced  roads.  From  Patagonia,  a  county  road, 
mostly paved, leads six miles to the former town site of Harshaw.  An interconnecting system of 
USFS-numbered  road  network,  originally  constructed  largely  for  exploration,  mining  and 
ranching  exists  around  Harshaw  and  the  district.  The  property,  which  extends  southward  for 
approximately two miles from Harshaw is accessed  by a series of low maintenance two track 
roads, some of which have been used since the 1870s.  A major rail hub is located approximately 
15 miles south near the city of Nogales.
5.4
Physiography
The Hermosa property is located in an area of moderate to rugged topography, with numerous 
arroyos  and  canyons  incised  through  volcanic  stratigraphy.    The  arroyos  and  canyons  contain 
streams which flow intermittently in response to rainfall events or for extended periods during 
extended periods of rain. Elevation on the property area ranges from 4800 to 6,200 feet above 
sea level.  Vegetation is typical of the Pinyon-Oak-Juniper Woodland and is characterized by 
short evergreen trees and scrub oaks mixed with a variety of desert and upland shrubs.  Lower 
slope faces are covered by open grasslands.

6.0  History
6-1
6.1  General History, Mining History, and Production 
Mining in the Harshaw District dates from Spanish Colonial times in the mid-18th century, but is 
often  poorly  documented  before  the  1870s.  Originally,  oxide  lead-silver  vein  ore  was  mined 
from  the  Trench  property,  located  approximately  one  mile  northwest  of  Hermosa,  and  the 
Mowry property located approximately 2 miles to the south. This work continued sporadically 
until the late 19th century. History from the late 1800s and early 1900s can be found in Schrader 
(1915: USGS Bulletin 582) and Keith (1975: AZ Geol. Survey Bulletin 191). 
 
Some of the early small-scale mine owners in the Hermosa area developed the ore deposits and 
registered  small  tonnages  of  production,  mostly  direct-shipping  oxides.  This  production  is 
seldom accurately recorded. The historic production from the individual mines in the Hermosa 
area is less than 150,000 tons, but around 2 million tons for the greater Harshaw district. The 
main focus of the production effort was silver and minor lead, but important production of direct-
shipping manganese ores was recorded, especially during the two World Wars and Korean War. 
Historical production records from the Hermosa and adjacent properties are sketchy, but the bulk 
of  the  production  from  the  small  underground  operations  in  the  area  was  about  half  direct-
shipping oxide ore with the remainder being milling ore. 
 
There was a small jig mill operating at the Hardshell Incline Mine from 1896 to 1905, as well as 
other local mills and smelters elsewhere in the area at various times. A summary of the historic 
production of the Hermosa area mines is presented in Table 6.1-1. This table was derived from 
Arizona  Bureau  of  Mine  Data  (Bulletin  191,  1975)  and  ASARCO  file  data  compiled  by 
Fleetwood Koutz, as part of his research work at the University of Arizona and at ASARCO. 
 
The Alta Claim located northwest of Hardshell was staked in 1877. It produced several thousand 
tons  of  oxidized  high-grade  lead-silver  ore  from  a  35  degree  NE-dipping  narrow  vein.  The 
Hermosa  mine,  one-half  mile  to  the  southeast  of    the  Hardshell  Incline  Mine  was  discovered 
about the same time and developed into a major project that brought several thousand people to 
the Harshaw area in 1880 to 1883. The Hermosa developed high-grade silver halide ores, in a 30-
degree  north-dipping  stratiform  vein,  in  the  volcanic  stratigraphy  with  mineralized  cross 
structures that averaged 20 ounces per ton (oz/t) Ag. About 70,000 recorded tons were processed 
in a local 100 tpd mill over an 18 to 24 month period. The 1.4 million ounces of production is 
confirmed  by  Wells  Fargo  shipping  records.  Additional  production  from  1902  to  1943  from 
scavenging in open cuts and the old workings brings the total Hermosa production to 2 million 
ounces silver with co-products of lead and copper. 
 
The  Hardshell  Incline  Mine  (separate  mineralized  horizon  from  the  current  Hermosa  deposit) 
was discovered in 1879. Production from this and neighboring workings between 1896 and 1964 
amounted to about 35,000 tons with an average grade of about 8 oz/t and 6 to 8 percent lead. The 
Hardshell Incline Mine in 1919 produced jig concentrates averaging 40 percent manganese, 12 
percent silica, 15 oz/t of silver, and 10 percent lead.

ASARCO Exploration History
6.2 
ASARCO operated the nearby Trench Mine, one mile northwest of Hermosa, between 1939 and 
1949, produced lead, zinc, silver, and copper from a fissure vein sulfide deposit. The 150-tpd 
Trench lead-zinc flotation mill also custom operated on district ores between 1939 and 1964. The 
Hermosa Property was first used as a source of water for the Trench Mill, and was explored by 
ASARCO by geological mapping and intermittent drill programs from 1940 until about 1991. 
 
The original diamond drilling, spurred by WWII premium metal prices, failed to find significant 
extensions of Hardshell Incline Pb-Ag ores, but several thousand tons of Pb-Ag moderate grade 
oxide ore were shipped from the lower levels of the incline from 1943 to 1948 and again in 1963 
and 1964. Diamond drilling to the southeast of and stratigraphically below the Incline led to the 
discovery  of  thick  Ag-Pb-Zn  bearing,  apparently  stratiform  manganese  oxides  of  the  Main 
Manto from 1947-54. The four main Hardshell claims were patented by ASARCO on this basis 
from 1958 to 1961. Rising silver prices in the mid-1960s, after the closure of the Trench Mill, 
lead to renewed interest in Hermosa mineralization. Review of the data and geologic mapping 
lead to staking additional claims in the district and acquisition of three patented claims of the 
Hardshell Group from 1965 to 1968. The Alta patented claim was purchased in the late 1970s. 
 
Detailed studies continued in the late 1970s by ASARCO with significant beneficiation testwork, 
especially pyro-metallurgical, continuing up until the early 1990s. ASARCO conducted testwork 
on many processes to recover the silver including high-tension magnetic separation, electrostatic 
separation, reduction and segregation roasting, SO2 and thio-sulfate leaching as well as various 
cyanidation processes, in both company and commercial test laboratories. This work, except for 
reduction roast, did not progress beyond bench scale testing. 
 
ASARCO  made  a  number  of  historical  resource  and  “reserve”  estimates  that  pre-date  the 
reporting  requirements  of  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101.  A  qualified  person  has  not 
reviewed these estimates and it is not known what assumptions, parameters, and limitations were 
applied and as such the following estimates are presented for historical reference only and are 
not to be relied upon. 
 
After initial drilling in 1968, an open pit resource of 6.5 million tons at 5 oz/t Ag; 1 to 2 percent 
total  Pb+Zn;  15  percent  MnO2  was  calculated.  This  figure  is  contained  in  many  older 
publications on Hardshell. An open pit resource was calculated by ASARCO in 1975 to contain 
INDEPENDENT

Hermosa 2012 Mineral Resource 
 
20 million tons at an average grade of 3.33 oz/t silver with 8 percent manganese, with a stripping 
ratio of 2:1 (waste:ore). An ASARCO resource estimate carried out in 1979 estimated a range of 
resources, the median of which is 6,586,500 tons at an average  grade of 7.92 oz/t silver, at a 
cutoff  grade  of  5  oz/t  silver.  A  mineral  inventory  estimate  calculated  by  ASARCO  in  1984 
estimated a resource of 9,596,000 short tons with an average grade of 6.9 oz/t silver, at a cutoff 
grade of 1.5 oz/t. 
 
From  1994  to  2002,  Pan  American  Silver  had  a  minimal  lease/option/first  right  of  refusal  on 
most of ASARCO’s Hardshell property. Pan American Silver did no significant field exploration 
work, though the company conducted internal economic evaluations.
Property Ownership History
6.3 
The Hermosa Property is owned outright by Arizona Minerals, Inc., a Nevada Corporation which 
has been registered with the Arizona Corporation Commission to do business within the State of 
Arizona  since  October  4,  2005.  On  October  28,  2005,  Arizona  Minerals  entered  into  an 
agreement with ASARCO, LLC to purchase the Hermosa Property. At the time of purchase, the 
property  consisted  of  the  eight  patented  claims  in  three  separate  tax  parcels  acquired  by  a 
combination of patents in 1961 and purchase in 1968 and 1978; as well as 26 unpatented “Shell” 
lode claims located in 1965 and 1968 by American Smelting and Refining Company. American 
Smelting and Refining Company later changed its name to ASARCO, Inc. and was subsequently 
merged into ASARCO LLC. On February 17, 2006, the US Bankruptcy Court, Southern District 
of Texas, Corpus Christy Division in Case 05-21207 approved the sale of the Hardshell Group of 
Mining Claims by ASARCO, LLC to Arizona Minerals, Inc. This acquisition closed on March 
14, 2006, with the final payment made to ASARCO, LLC on March 14, 2007. Arizona Minerals 
has no royalty or other obligations due ASARCO, LLC or any predecessor claim owners. 
 
As  part  of  the  purchase  agreement  with  ASARCO,  LLC,  Arizona  Minerals  also  acquired  all 
available  originals  or  copies  of  data  pertaining  to  the  property  including  information  on  land, 
geology,  previous  drilling,  assays,  engineering,  groundwater,  metallurgical  studies.    Also 
transferred to Wildcat Silver were the remaining drill cores, samples and assay pulps. 
 
Arizona Minerals located an additional 44 lode claims (about 909 acres) surrounding the original 
26 in December 2006 and January 2007. In April and May 2007 an additional 77 lode claims 
(about 1,447 acres) were staked by Arizona Minerals, to the east toward the San Rafael Valley, 
and south almost to the Mowry Mining Camp. In 2008, four additional claims were staked to 
cover orphan fractions around patented ground, one unnecessary claim dropped, and 44 claims 
were  amended  at  the  recommendation  of  the  BLM  to  cover  slight  imperfections  in  the 
descriptions of the quarter sections in this non-standard township. An additional 16 claims (about 
330  acres)  were  staked  in  September  2008  to  complete  the  NE  corner  of  the  claim  block.  In 
November 2011 an additional 85 claims (1,623 acres) were staked on the east side of the WCS 
claim  block.  This  brings  the  total  to  251  unpatented  lode  claims  (on  surface  lands  of  the 
Coronado National Forest) totalling approximately 4,723 acres.

7.0  Geological Setting
Regional Geology
7.1 
The regional geology of the area is shown in Figure 7.1-1. The geology below is summarized 
from Simons, 1972; Schrader and Hill, 1915; Koutz, 1984 and Berger et al, 2003. 
 
The  oldest  rocks  in  the  Patagonia  Mountains  area  are  predominantly  Proterozoic  granodiorite 
with  subordinate  amounts  of  pelitic  schist,  diorite  and  gabbro.    Phanerozoic  siliclastic  and 
carbonate rocks overlie the Precambrian basement. The Paleozoic section consists of Cambrian 
to Permian limestones, dolomites, and sandstones exposed at the Mowry historic mine located 2 
miles south of Hermosa and in semi-homoclinal, 30 degree north-dipping section from Mowry to 
American Peak at Hermosa.  
 
Mesozoic volcanic, sedimentary and intrusive rocks are widely exposed. The oldest are Triassic 
to  Jurassic  volcanic  and  sedimentary  rocks.  Volcanic  rocks  predominate  and  the  sedimentary 
rocks include quartzite, sandstone, arkose and shale. Cretaceous andesitic (74 to 72 Ma) to felsic 
volcanic/volcaniclastic (83 Ma) and intrusive rocks cover much of the project area and extend to 
the north on the western, southern, and eastern flanks of Red Mountain. Many of the Mesozoic 
volcaniclastic breccias demonstrate textural characteristics of caldera margin environments. 
 
Mesozoic  and  Cenozoic  granite  intrusive  rocks  are  widespread  throughout  the  Patagonia 
Mountains. In the northwestern Patagonia Mountains, Jurassic granite, dated at 160 million years 
(Ma),  intrudes  Triassic  to  Jurassic  volcanic  and  sedimentary  rocks.  Most  of  the  central  and 
southern  parts  of  the  range  consist  of  Paleocene  (64  to  58  Ma)  medium  to  coarse-grained 
hornblende granodiorite. The main Paleocene Patagonia biotite hornblende granodiorite batholith 
is bounded by northwest-striking faults and its emplacement was structurally controlled. 
 
Paleocene (Laramide  - 63 to 60 Ma)  felsic volcanic and intrusive stocks  are prevalent at Red 
Mountain and west of the historic Trench mining camp in the Chief-Sunnyside Diatreme area (60 
to 58 Ma). Intrusion rocks and alteration at Sunnyside are coeval with alteration at Hermosa (59 
Ma).  The  Hermosa  primary  mineralization  appears  to  be  the  outer  zoned  portions  of  the 
Sunnyside intrusive-mineralization center. 
 
Late Oligocene to Miocene conglomerates, sandstones, ash flow tuffs and lakebed sediment fill 
the San Rafael Basin to the east of the Patagonia Mountains and the northeast trending Sawmill 
Creek Basin. These basins have considerable Basin and Range-aged fault control. 
 
Regionally, the most prominent faults strike northwest and northeast. Mineral occurrences are 
commonly localized at the intersection of these regional structures.

In the Patagonia Mountains there are several parallel, northwest-striking, strike-slip fault zones, 
some of which were active during the Triassic and Jurassic, and again, episodically during the 
Cretaceous and early Tertiary. The Paleocene Patagonia biotite-hornblende granodiorite batholith 
is elongated northwest and bounded by linear, sub-parallel fault zones. The strike-slip fault on its

eastern margin is the Guajolote fault. To the northeast of the Guajolote fault is the northwest-
striking Harshaw Creek fault, the most prominent fault in the range with up to seven miles of 
potential left-lateral, strike-slip displacement. Stratigraphic and structural relationships between 
the two zones suggest they were active during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous and that linking 
braided faults were developed and reactivated during the early Cenozoic. 
 
The Hogan-January-Norton-Alum Gulch fault, a northwest-striking high angle fault/shear zone 
extends  from  the  Sonoita  Valley  west  of  Red  Mountain  southeast  for  at  least  five  miles  to 
Hermosa.  There  are  both  reverse  (northeast  side  up)  and  right-lateral  strike  slip  displacement 
along  this  zone.  This  fault  zone  appears  to  be  the  locus  of  much  of  the  mineralization  in  the 
Harshaw  district  including  the  Flux,  Chief,  World’s  Fair,  Trench  Area,  Alta,  Hardshell  and 
Hermosa historic workings. 
 
The American Fault zone extends northward from Mowry and cuts across the east side of the 
Hermosa deposit.  The American Fault displays normal movement and displaces the Paleozoic 
section  and  overlying  volcanic  section  and  mineralization  down  to  the  east.    East  of  the 
American are two parallel normal faults, the North Hermosa and Hermosa, both of which also 
displace  the  volcanic  section  down  to  the  east.  These  normal  faults  were  active  during 
Cretaceous volcanism, as shown by displaced horizons. Normal fault movement continued into 
the Tertiary along these and additional parallel zones that trend into the San Rafael Basin and 
offset the Tertiary conglomerate section down into the basin. 
 
Northeast striking extensional faulting opens the Sonoita Valley into grabens and half-grabens 
northwest of Red Mountain and the town of Patagonia. Minor northeast striking normal faulting 
is also common in the Harshaw area. These faults commonly control stream drainages and cause 
minor offsets in the mineralized horizons at Hermosa.
Property Geology

The  Hardshell  Ag-Mn-Pb-Zn  deposit  is  a  stratigraphically-  and  structurally-controlled,  manto-

The drill program completed between December 2010 and March 2012 was concentrated in the 
western portion of the project area, designated the Hardshell Hill zone, and is the location for 
most  of  the  currently  identified  mineral  resource.  The  eastern  portion  of  the  project  area  is 
designated the Hermosa zone. Important stratigraphic differences that bear on the distribution of 
mineralization exist between the two zones. Please refer to Figures 7.2-4 and 7.2-5 for schematic 
representation of the stratigraphic section.

Lithology and Stratigraphy 
The Cretaceous volcanic rocks and the underlying Permian sedimentary rocks of the Hermosa 
project area are divided into the following units, recognized across the property and in the drill 
holes.  They are listed and described from youngest to oldest.
Trachyandesite of Meadow Valley. Designated andesite and (Kmv) on map and sections. 
It  is  an  approximately  conformable,  complex  flow  unit  that  overlies  the  Hardshell 
Volcanic  Sequence  on  the  western  and  northern  margins  of  the  Hermosa  property. 
Drilling  shows  local  dikes  of  similar  composition.  The  trachyandesite  is  variably 
described  as  dark  gray  to  brown,  fine-  to  medium-grained  with  1-  to  3-mm,  euhedral-
subhedral plagioclase phenocrysts and sparse 2- to 5-mm square K-feldspar phenocrysts

Hardshell Volcanic Sequence. Five distinct rhyolitic volcanic units have been identified 
as making up the Hardshell sequence, and are correlated between map and drill holes.
Rhyolite crystal tuff. Designated (Khct) on map and cross-sections. Appears to be 
the uppermost unit in the Hardshell volcanic sequence and is conformable with 
underlying  rhyolite  breccia  unit  (Khb).  Described  as  white  to  gray  to  buff  to 
locally  pale  pink,  fine-  to  medium-grained,  and  crystal-rich.    Rare,  thin,  relict 
bedding  planes.    Abundant  1-  to  3-mm  plagioclase  crystals  and  rare  0.5-mm, 
broken  quartz  eyes.  Rare  patches  and  zones  of  5-  to  15-mm,  angular  to 
subrounded lithic clasts. 
 
Rhyolite  Breccia.  Designated  (Khb)  on  map  and  cross-sections.  Prominent 
outcrop  former  in  the  Hardshell  Hill  zone.  Clast-supported  or  nearly  clast-
supported  fragmental  unit  with  abundant  1-mm  to  >  5-m,  angular,  unsorted, 
rhyolite    clasts  in  very-fine-grained  rhyolitic  groundmass.  Contains  abundant 
clasts with diameters greater than core diameter. 
 
Rhyolite Lithic Tuff. Designated (Khlt) on map and cross-sections. Gray to gray-
green,  locally  crystal-rich  tuff  with  common  5-  to  25-mm  rhyolitic  lithic

fragments  in  very-fine-grained,  partially  welded  groundmass  give  the  rock  a 
distinctive, whispy, eutaxitic texture. 
 
Rhyolite Polymict Breccia. Designated (KhHZ) on map and cross-sections. This 
is  the  named  Hardshell  Zone,  and  interpreted  to  be  the  primary  host  to  the 
deposits exploited by the old Hardshell Incline workings. Rhyolite volcaniclastic 
and fragmental unit with abundant 1- to 25-mm, angular, rhyolite lithic clasts in a 
welded,  eutaxitic  matrix.  Distinguished  from  Khlt  by  the  presence  of  sparse  to 
very  abundant  sedimentary  clasts  derived  from  underlying  Paleozoic  rocks. 
Contains limestone clasts up to more than 10-m across. Commonly mineralized 
with  Mn-oxide  as  1-  to  10-mm  blebs  and  larger  pods  up  to  complete 
replacements,  as  well  as  in  veins/veinlets  and  fracture  coatings.  Local  zones  of 
gray, vuggy, pervasive silicification. 
 
Rhyolite  Tuff.  Designated  (Kht)  on  map  and  cross–sections.  Basal  unit  in 
Hardshell Volcanic Sequence. Light gray, massive, rhyolite tuff with rare, fine-
grained  plagioclase  phenocrysts  and  rare,  <  10-mm  lithic  clasts  in  very-fine-
grained,  tuffaceous  groundmass.  Local  irregular,  faint  relict  bedding  and  weak, 
hematite-limonite liesegang banding. Lies directly on Paleozoic sedimentary rock 
in the western part of the property, and on the spherulite unit (KoSP) of the Older 
Volcanic Sequence to the east.

Older  Volcanic  Sequence.  The  Older  Volcanic  Sequence  is  a  predominantly  rhyolitic 
volcanic package that underlies the Hardshell Sequence in the eastern part of the property 
and  contains  lithologies  that  occur  as  clasts  in  the  Hardshell  Volcanic  Sequence, 
especially in the Khb and Khlt units. The Older Volcanic Sequence has not been mapped 
in detail, and relatively few core holes penetrate the unit. The following units have been

spherulites in very-fine-grained partially welded groundmass. 
 
Rhyolite  Welded  Tuff.  Designated  (KoT)  on  map  and  cross-sections.  Light 
reddish-gray to purple, densely welded crystal tuff with strong to subtle laminar 
eutaxitic  texture.  Abundant,  0.1-  to  3-mm,  subhedral  to  euhedral,  plagioclase 
phenocrysts in shard-bearing, eutaxitic, very-fine-grained groundmass. Laminated 
to  thin-bedded,  locally  contorted  due  to  flowage.  This  rock  type  is  the  most 
common clast lithology in the Khb of the Hardshell Volcanic Sequence.  
 
Latite  Porphyry.  Designated  (KoLA)  on  map  and  cross-sections.  Distinctly 
porphyritic  intrusive  and/or  flow  unit  with  prominent,  abundant,  1-  to  5-mm, 
subhedral to euhedral, white, prismatic plagioclase phenocrysts and less common 
1- to 5-mm, euhedral, white, approximately equant K-feldspar phenocrysts. Rare, 
relict, 0.1- to 1-mm, rotten, biotite books in fine- to medium-grained, red-brown

Concha  Formation.  Designated  Pzl  on  map  and  cross-sections.  Gray,  massive,  fine-
grained,  recrystallized  limestone-marble  with  common  1-  by  5-cm  to  10-  by  25-cm, 
irregular dark gray to black chert pods. Local 1- to 5-mm wide, irregular, discontinuous

7.3 Alteration 
Rhyolitic rocks, particularly Khb, in both the Hardshell Hill and Hermosa zones are uniformly 
light gray to tan, with primary volcanic and clastic textures generally well preserved. The same 
rocks are generally shades of purple to maroon where they crop out at a distance from known 
mineralization. Locally, in otherwise unaltered rhyolite outcrops, small patches of fine-grained 
secondary  K-feldspar  have  been  noted.  These  observations  suggest  that  the  tan  coloration 
proximal  to  mineralization  may  be  pervasive  and  moderately  strong  potassic  alteration.  This

alteration seems to form a broad background upon which later alteration more directly associated 
with the Hermosa project mineralization has been imposed. 
The clasts within Hardshell volcanic sequence lithic tuff and breccia are commonly selectively 
overprinted by white kaolinite-sericite veinlets and patches. The fine-grained, tuffaceous, matrix 
to the lithic tuff, polymict breccia and lower rhyolite tuff are pervasively overprinted by very-
fine,  disseminated  kaolinite-sericite.  In  both  cases,  primary  textures  are  generally  very  well 
preserved and the rock remains competent and hard.
7-12
Manto-type  mineralization  is  always  surrounded  by  an  asymmetric  envelope  of  pervasive  and 
strong  silicification,  referred  to  in  the  past  as  “jasperoid”.  The  greatest  volume  and  the  most 
massive  expression  of  this  silicification  is  within  the  rhyolite  tuff  in  the  hanging  wall  of  the 
manto. There it commonly penetrates more than 10-meters above manto mineralization.  In the 
footwall carbonates, silicification is less complete and penetrates only a few meters below the 
manto.  Primary  mineralogy  and  texture  in  these  rocks  are  completely  replaced  by  gray,  fine-
grained quartz. Rare small patches or pods of ghostly relict volcanic texture have been noted. 
Concha and Scherrer formation carbonate rocks typically are weakly to moderately recrystallized 
and  contain  fine  to  coarse,  irregular  and  discontinuous  calcite  veinlets.  They  are  commonly 
bleached  to  a  light  gray  color.  Fossils  are  normally  well  preserved  along  with  fine  primary 
sedimentary  textures.  A  few  drill  holes  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the  property  contain 
increasingly  pervasive  and  stronger  recrystallization  in  the  Concha  carbonate  rocks  that 
ultimately grades into calc-silicate skarn with associated base metal sulfide mineralization. 
Calcareous sandstone intervals contain fewer calcite veinlets but they are still present. Quartzites 
only rarely host calcite veinlets. 
Andesite  drill  intercepts  and  outcrops  typically  contain  fine,  thin,  irregular  and  discontinuous 
calcite  veinlets  and  may  also  contain  finely  distributed  groundmass  calcite.  Biotite,  where 
present, is typically  degraded with  greenish  chlorite selvages. Magnetite is occasionally noted 
and pyrite is by no means uncommon.
7.4 Mineralization 
Mineralization has been subdivided into four ore-types shown on cross-sections (Figures 7.2-2 
and 7.2-3). The oxidized rhyolites overlying manto-style mineralization and the carbonate units 
contain irregular patches and zones of veinlet-controlled hematite-limonite and sooty Mn-oxide 
with accessory Ag mineralization. Manto-style mineralization in rocks of rhyolitic composition 
is dominated by black, sooty Mn-oxide, with or without yellowish-orange secondary Pb-oxides 
and  with  quartz-dominant  gangue  mineralogy.  Manto-style  mineralization  in  carbonate  rocks 
does  not  typically  contain  Pb-oxides.  Strong,  pervasive  gray,  silicification  is  also  present  and 
calcite  occurs  as  veinlets,  vugs  and  fracture  fillings.  Drill  core  intercepts  containing 
rhodochrosite and pink calcite are not uncommon and rarer intercepts of hard pinkish rhodonite 
have also been noted. 
A  separate,  noteworthy  horizon  in  the  upper  oxide  silver  zone  has  been  designated  the 
“Hardshell Zone” (Figures 7.2-1, 7.2-2 and 7.2-3). This zone supported historic mining at the 
Hardshell  Incline  mine  and  is  composed  of  a  10-  to  greater  than  100-foot  polymict  rhyolite

breccia with a minor portion of clasts of carbonate sedimentary provenance and is the locus of 
partial to massive Mn-oxide replacement mineralization. 
Calc-silicate  skarn  mineralization  developed  within  the  Concha  limestone,  particularly  in  the 
northwestern-most  drill  holes.  These  skarns  contains  patches  and  massive,  wholesale 
replacements  of  carbonate  by  very-fine-grained,  massive,  wollastonite-diopside  and  rhodonite. 
They  also  contain  coarse-grained,  crystalline  aggregates  of  galena,  alabandite,  sphalerite, 
chalcopyrite and pyrite.

7.5 Structural Geology 
Outcrops,  old  workings  and  road  cuts  are  commonly  disrupted  by  irregular,  discontinuous, 
complex  structural  zones.  These  zones  are  characterized  by  rubbly,  broken,  brecciated  and 
sheared  features  that  do  not  typically  displace  either  lithologic  contacts  or  alteration  or 
mineralization zones at map or cross-section scale (typically 1:2400).  
This fracturing and small-displacement faulting is confirmed by geotechnical measurements on 
core  from  the  2010-2012  drilling  campaign  that  showed  the  average  core  recovery  was  84 
percent and the average RQD measurement was only 27 percent. 
Summary and Conclusion
1.  Hermosa  project  geology  is  characterized  by  relatively  un-disrupted  volcanic  and
sedimentary stratigraphy, alteration and mineralization.
2.  Alteration and mineralization combine to form coherent, continuous bodies. 
3.  Upper  silver,  manto  and  PZ  ore  types  are  based  on  gangue  characteristics,  lithological
host and grade profiles.

8.0  Deposit Type
8-1
The mineral deposit at the Hermosa project is a manto-type replacement deposit, located along 
the stratigraphic contact between Cretaceous  rhyolite volcanic  rocks and underlying Paleozoic 
carbonates.  The  manto  is  composed  predominately  of  cryptomelane-type  manganese  oxide 
minerals. Silver and base metals are thought to  occur predominately in the lattice-structure of 
cryptomelane.  Accessory  silver-bearing  sulfides  and  sulfosalts  as  well  as  lead  oxides  and 
sulphate minerals are present as well.
Rhyolite country rocks lying above the manto are partially oxidized and commonly host sooty 
Mn-oxide and Fe-oxide coated fractures and veinlets. Assay results indicate that silver and minor 
base metal mineralization is associated with these veinlets and fractures as well as disseminated 
in the volcanics.
Weak phyllic alteration overprints the rhyolite volcanic rocks, andesites are overprinted by weak 
propylitic  alteration  assemblages  and  wollastonite-diopside-rhodonite  bearing,  calc-silicate 
skarns  with  base  metal  sulfide  mineralization  occur  in  the  northwestern  extents  of  the  project 
area.
The Laramide Red Mountain porphyry copper deposit is located approximately two-miles from 
the  Hermosa  project.  The  Laramide  Sunnyside  Diatreme  is  nearer  to  the  Hermosa  project, 
located approximately one-half mile northwest. The porphyry style alteration and the proximity 
to the Hermosa project area suggest a genetic link but direct evidence for an association with 
either or both of these intrusions has not been recognized to-date.

9.0  Exploration 
The following discussion is an overview of the exploration programs conducted on the Hermosa 
property by Asarco (1940 – 1991) and Wildcat Silver Corp. (2006 – 2010 and 2010 - 2012). 
 
ASARCO Exploration (1940 – 1991)
The Hermosa Property was explored by ASARCO by geological mapping and intermittent drill 
programs from 1940 until about 1991. The original diamond drilling, spurred by WWII premium 
metal prices, failed to find significant extensions of Hardshell  Incline Pb-Ag ores, but several 
thousand  tons  of  moderate  grade  Pb-Ag  oxide  ore  were  shipped  from  the  lower  levels  of  the 
incline from 1943 to 1948 and again in 1963 and 1964. Diamond drilling from 1946 to 1953 
located southeast of and stratigraphically below the incline led to the discovery of thick Ag-Pb-
Zn  bearing,  apparently  stratabound  manganese  oxides  of  the  Main  Manto.  Based  on  this 
discovery, the four main Hardshell claims were patented by ASARCO from 1958 to 1961. 
 
Rising silver prices in the mid-1960s, after the closure of the Trench Mill, led to renewed interest 
in  the  Hermosa  mineralization.  Re-evaluation  of  the  geologic  data  led  to  staking  additional 
claims in the district and acquisition of the three patented claims of the Hermosa Group from 
1965 to 1968. Because of the difficulty of penetrating the silica-jasperoid caprock and vuggy-
silica manganese oxide ore zone with diamond drilling tools of the time, ASARCO used almost 
exclusively,  newly  developed,  air-hammer  rotary  drilling.  Diamond  drilling  was  used 
successfully in some outlying stratigraphic holes but was only partially successful in attempts to 
deepen hammer drill holes in vuggy, silicified limestone due to issues with lost circulation of 
fluids. 
 
Geophysical surveying, detailed geologic and metallurgical studies on the manganese oxide ores 
began in the late 1960s.  In the 1970s and early  1980s rotary hammer drilling continued, with 
some  relatively  close-spaced  holes  around  higher  grade  silver  zones  in  an  attempt  to  define  a 
resource that could be developed by underground mining. Drilling from 1981 to 1984 partially 
defined a low manganese, heap-leachable, low-grade silver resource located at and north of the 
historic  Hermosa  mine  workings.  Three  shallow  rotary  hammer  drill  holes  were  completed  in 
1989 for metallurgical samples and a 1500 foot deep diamond drill hole in 1990-91 explored for 
deeper mineralization. In all, ASARCO drilled 114 air-hammer and core holes, with an aggregate 
of about 46,000 feet on the Hermosa Property and surrounding area. Drilling was often limited in 
depth and extent. 
 
Detailed studies continued in the late 1970s by ASARCO with significant beneficiation test work 
focussing primarily on pyro-metallurgical testing.  This work  continued  until the early  1990s. 
ASARCO  conducted  testwork  on  many  processes  to  recover  the  silver  including  high-tension 
magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, reduction and segregation roasting, SO2 and thio-
sulfate  leaching  and  various  cyanidation  processes,  in  both  company  and  commercial

laboratories. This test work was limited to bench scale testing with the exception of the reduction 
roast. Previous work was sporadic due to low metal prices.  Other than lead, little consideration 
was given to recovering other metals present such as Mn, Zn, Cu, Au or potential co-products 
such as silica or clays. Only minor test consideration was given to heap-leaching non-manganese 
low-grade silver ores such as those identified in the Hermosa area. 
 
Wildcat Silver Exploration (2006 – 2010)
9-2
Wildcat Silver Corporation has been actively exploring the Hermosa Property since 2006. Initial 
work  included  a  review  and  evaluation  of  all  available  ASARCO  data,  including  remaining 
sample and core material. A major part of the evaluation was to re-assay all remaining ASARCO 
drill pulps. This project was intended to verify the silver and manganese data, but also to add 
high-quality Pb, Zn, Cu, and Au values to the database. Rock types, alteration, and mineral codes 
from  paper  drill  logs  and  cross  sections  were  added  to  the  electronic  assay  database  which 
included all known ASARCO assays and 16 element X-ray fluorescence analyses. Preliminary 
SO2 leach tests were run on two  composite samples of assay pulps  at  Hazen  Labs. The work 
culminated  in  the  preparation  of  a  resource  estimate  and  preliminary  economic  evaluation 
documented in a February 7, 2007 NI 43-101 Preliminary Assessment report, prepared by the 
mining consulting firm of Pincock Allen and Holt. 
 
Subsequently,  140  additional  lode  mining  claims  were  staked  in  three  stages.  Patented  claim 
lines were brushed out and flagged. All patented claim corners were checked, reset if necessary 
and  a  Record  of  Survey  by  a  Registered  Land  Surveyor  filed  with  the  Santa  Cruz  County 
Recorder. Historic access and drill roads plus drill pads were brushed out and returned to their 
former permitted condition of the 1960s through the 1980s. Additional drill roads and pads were 
built on patented ground. Office space and local housing was obtained outside of Patagonia. A 
secure  work  site  for  sample  storage,  core  logging  and  splitting  was  built  in  Harshaw  and  has 
been expanded several times.  
 
Drilling has been conducted in three programs. In 2007 four core holes totalling 4,450 feet were 
completed for comparison with 4 previously drilled ASARCO rotary air-hammer drill holes.  In 
2007  and  2008,  three  deep  exploration  core  holes,  totalling  7,928  feet,  tested  a  potential 
northwest  extension  of  the  Main  Manto  Zone  mineralization  along  the  Hogan  Fault  Zone.  In 
2009, a follow up of positive exploration results was undertaken with 6 deep core holes (12,005 
feet) sited in and peripheral to the Hogan Fault Zone. These holes were located to test the down-
dip  projection  of  the  Main  Manto  Zone.    The  assay  results  from  this  work  and  bench-scale 
metallurgical test work at Hazen Laboratory in Golden, Colorado was used as the foundation for 
a  resource  update  and  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (PEA)  which  was  completed  and 
released in October 2010 by M3 Engineering of Tucson.

In  December  of  2010,  WSC  embarked  on  a  major  drilling  program  to  find  the  extent  of  the 
Hermosa mineralization.  In addition to the drilling activities, surface mapping of the geology 
and  structures  was  undertaken  to  help  better  understand  and  interpret  the  results  from  the 
expanded drilling program.  Other activities during the program included the completion of an 
airborne electromagnetic (AEM) and magnetic survey and an expansion of the unpatented claim 
block. 
 
Beginning in December 2010 up to five drill rigs, including 3 reverse circulation and 2 diamond 
core rigs, were used to complete the planned drilling program.  The reverse circulation rigs were 
used primarily to test the shallow targets (< 800 feet) while the core drills were used to test the 
deeper  (>800  feet)  portions  of  the  mineralized  system.    Drilling  through  September  15,  2011 
included 95 holes totalling 81,387 feet.  In October 2011, drilling results and assays were merged 
into the existing Hermosa database in order to complete an update of the resource contained at 
Hermosa.  Rock codes were updated to reflect a better understanding of the ore types as well as 
updating classifications of the rock types.  The completed database, including wireframes, was 
delivered to Independent Mining Consultants (IMC) of Tucson to update the Hermosa resource. 
 
Drilling  used  to  the  calculate  the  resource  included  the  95  holes  completed  by  WSC  in  the 
current  program,  as  well  as  121  combined  core,  reverse  circulation  and  air  rotary  drill  holes 
completed in previous drill campaigns by WSC and Asarco. Table 10.1-1 below in the “Drilling” 
section is a summary of the drilling types and programs used to calculate the current resource. 
 
An  additional  part  of  the  2011  program  was  to  stake  85  lode  mining  claims  (1,623  acres) 
extending  the  eastern  margin  of  the  claim  block.    These  claims  were  staked  by  a  certified 
surveyor, Darling and Company, from Tucson.  The additional claims were filed with both the 
federal and county governments in November 2011. 
 
From  October  23  to  November  3,  2011,  Geotech  Ltd.,  a  Canadian  geophysical  firm 
headquartered in Aurora, Ontario Canada, completed an airborne time domain electromagnetic 
(VTEM) and magnetic survey of the WSC claim block.  The survey was flown along north-south 
oriented  lines  at  a  spacing  of  328  feet  (100  meters).    A  total  of  618  line  miles  (995  line 
kilometers) of geophysical data was acquired during the survey.  A final report on the airborne 
survey and interpretation is expected in February 2012.

Introduction
10.1 
The  Hermosa  deposit  was  initially  drilled  by  ASARCO  (1950  –  1964)  with  more  recent  and 
extensive work by WSC (2006-2010 and 2010-2012). Table 10.1-1 is a breakdown of the various 
drilling  programs  by  drilling  types  and  footages.    Figure  10.1-1  is  a  drill  location  map  of  the 
holes completed prior to 15 September 2011. In total 216 holes, from both the current and prior 
drilling programs were completed and used in the calculation of the current resource.  Six (6) 
Asarco drill holes fell outside the resource area and were not used in the calculation. Ninety-five 
(95)  holes  completed  in  the  current  program  with  an  aggregate  footage  of  81.287  feet  are 
designated in red on the drill location map.

10.2  Previous Drilling 
ASARCO drilled 114 air-hammer and core holes with an aggregate length of 46,000 feet on the 
Hermosa Property. This drilling dates from 1950 to 1991. Driller’s logs, drill supervisors notes 
and monthly reports, geologic and graphic logs for most of these holes are available. Data sheets 
for  all  assayed  intervals  after  1966  are  available.  Original  lab  assay  certificates  from  drilling 
before 1966 may not be available. In such cases, assay data was extracted from cross sections, 
graphic logs and old reports. 
 
Asarco completed 92 non-core drill holes totalling 31,000 feet. Ninety-one (91) holes were air-
hammer and one (1) hole was reverse circulation. Most of this drilling did not penetrate the static 
water table. 
 
Approximately half of ASARCO’s rotary drill holes are concentrated in a 30-acre core area using 
an irregular 150- to 200-foot spacing. The majority of the remaining rotary drill holes are located 
in the surrounding 150-acres using an irregular 100- to 800-foot spacing.

For drill holes to HDS-55, a small, representative sample of coarse reject material was collected 
for  each  sample  interval  and  used  to  construct  chip  boards.  Interval  notation  and  assays  were 
annotated for each assay interval. Geologic logs were prepared from the chip boards. 
 
Beginning with HDS-56, five- and ten-foot washed and sieved character samples were preserved 
in clear plastic medicine vials and stored BX and NX core boxes. Geological logs were prepared 
using these stored samples. 
 
ASARCO drilled 22 core holes at Hermosa totalling 15,000-feet. Core drilling from 1942 to the 
1960  was  conventional,  non-wire  line  in  NX,  BX  and  AX  diameters.  Later  core  drilling  was 
wireline, in NX-NQ to BX-BQ diameters. Poor recovery plagued the small diameter drilling. 
 
Core has been logged in detail.  Down-hole deviation was not measured for any of the ASARCO 
drill holes at Hermosa.
10.3  Wildcat Silver Drilling (2006 – 2009) 
WSC completed 13 diamond drill holes on the Hermosa Property in 2006-2009. Four of these 
holes were part of a twin drilling program conducted in 2007 and the remaining nine holes tested 
for a northwest extension of mineralization. 
 
Core surfaces were washed by the drill helper and transferred from split-tube half-section to the 
core box. Core was initially field-logged and photographed. It was then logged for geotechnical 
characteristics,  lithology,  alteration  and  mineralization.  Assay  intervals  were  then  marked  and 
recorded.  All  holes  were  surveyed  for  directional  deviation  using  a  Reflex  EZ-Shot  magnetic 
survey tool.
Comparative Drilling Evaluation
WSC drilled four (4) core holes in 2007 for comparison with air-hammer drilling and to test for 
deeper  mineralized  horizons.  Separation  distances  between  core  and  air-hammer  holes  ranged 
from seven (7) to 28 feet (Table 10.1-2). Drill technique induced grade bias was not detected and 
grade variation was observed to reflect natural short range grade differences in the deposit rather 
than deficiencies in air-hammer or core sample recoveries.

11.0  Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security
11.1 ASARCO Drilling Program 1950 - 1991
Drilling  by  ASARCO  generated  two  types  of  samples:  chip  samples  derived  from  air  rotary 
hammer drilling and core samples from diamond drill holes. ASARCO’s drilling programs were 
intended solely to further their assessment of the economic merits of Hermosa, and as such, it is 
assumed that sampling conformed to standard industry practices of the time.
11.2 Wildcat Silver Corporation 2006 - 2009
WCS (2006 – 2009) completed 13 diamond core holes totalling 24,400 feet and a program of re-
assaying pulps generated by the previous ASARCO drilling program(s).
Core samples
Core samples were collected and split with a mechanical core splitter.  The core was split in half 
lengthwise by a geologist using a hydraulic splitter. Spatulas and trowels were used for splitting 
in clayey or rubbly core. The splitter and sample trays were carefully cleaned by brushes after 
each  sample  interval.  The  core  was  typically  sampled  on  5-foot  intervals.  In  areas  of 
mineralogical or geologic interest, sampling often occurred at variable intervals ranging from 0.5 
to 7 feet. 
 
Core  recovery  was  generally  good,  punctuated  by  limited  intervals  of  moderate  recovery 
representing sheared, broken and vuggy zones including voids.
Wildcat Silver re-assay of ASARCO Pulp Samples
ASARCO retained a large number of pulps from their sampling and assaying programs. These 
consisted of 150 to 300 grams of pulverized material stored in individual manila envelopes in 
labeled  cardboard  boxes.  WSC  took  possession  and  inventoried  these  pulps  from  secure 
ASARCO Tucson warehouse storage for the re-assaying program. Pulp samples were submitted 
to Skyline Laboratories in Tucson for analysis of manganese, lead, zinc, copper, gold, and silver. 
Approximately 50-200 grams or less now remain of many of these pulps.
11.3 Wildcat Silver Analytical Program  2006 - 2009
ASARCO Pulp Re-Analysis
In  order  to  have  a  complete  database  for  all  elements  of  interest,  Wildcat  conducted  a  major 
program  to  re-analyze  all  available  sample  pulps  from  previous  ASARCO  exploration  work. 
Some pulps were no longer available as they had been previously used up for analysis or lost. 
Reanalysis  of  the  available  samples  also  allowed  for  a  check  of  most  silver  and  manganese 
values against older analysis (lesser comparisons for wet chemical zinc, lead, and copper values) 
serving  as  an  additional  quality  control  check.  Sample  preparation  and  Cu,  Pb,  Zn,  and  Mn

analysis were conducted by Skyline Laboratories in Tucson, Arizona and Fire Assay for Ag and 
Au by  Assayers Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia. Skyline  Laboratories is a regionally 
recognized  and  accepted  laboratory  that  has  three  Arizona  Registered  Professional  Assayers 
certified by the Arizona State Board of Technical Registration, but was not ISO certified at the 
time. Assayers Canada are an ISO-9001-2000 certified, Registered British Columbia laboratory. 
 
It  was  often  necessary  to  reduce  the  pulp  charge  in  some  high  manganese  samples.  Skyline 
analyzed for manganese, zinc, and lead using inductively-coupled plasma (ICP), while copper 
was  analyzed  by  atomic  absorption  (AA).  The  pulps  were  run  through  Skyline  in  60  sample 
batches.  All  were  subject  to  routine  quality  control  programs  both  externally  by  WSC  and 
internally by Skyline and Assayers Canada. 
 
For analytical work by both Skyline and Assayers Canada, a standard sample was inserted every 
20th sample as a check of assay accuracy, which with repeated analysis during the course of the 
analytical program also served as a check of assay precision. Five standard samples for the pulp 
reanalysis program were prepared and certified by Mineral Exploration Group (MEG) in Reno, 
Nevada, using mineralized material from the Hermosa deposit. Standards were prepared at five 
grade  values  based  on  a  systematic  round  robin  analytical  program  that  included  work  by  six 
different laboratories. Blank samples were also included later in the reanalysis program. Blank 
samples  were  prepared  from  local  barren  crushed,  limestone  decorative  stone,  silica  sand  and 
volcanic rocks. The standards and blanks served as quality control for silver, manganese, zinc, 
lead, copper, and gold analyses. No systematic or significant problems were noted in the quality 
control programs results. A few minor sample switches and clerical errors were identified and 
corrected.
Drill Sample Analysis
Drill core samples from Wildcat drilling programs carried out from July 2007 to October 2009 
were  processed  at  an  on-site  sample  processing  facility  in  Harshaw,  Arizona.    Core  was 
completed  in  HQ  diameter,  the  exception  being  several  holes  were  downsized  in  areas  of 
difficult drilling and finished with NQ diameter.  The project geologist, once or twice daily, took 
custody  of  the  boxes  of  core  from  the  drillers  at  the  drill  site,  after  an  initial  inspection,  and 
transported them to the Harshaw facility. 
 
Core samples were mechanically split with one half placed in externally labeled plastic bags for 
analysis with an additional internal sample tag the top of the bag closed and secured with a tie, 
and then weighed. All samples were kept in locked ocean-shipping containers until they were 
shipped to the lab. The Harshaw site was regularly patrolled for security by WSC employees, 
contractors, local residents and law enforcement authorities). 
 
Split samples were periodically transported by an authorized company representative to Skyline 
Laboratory  in  Tucson,  Arizona.  After  cataloging  the  samples,  Skyline  crushed  the  core  to 
produce pulp with greater than 80 percent of the sample passing 10-mesh screen. Samples were 
blended  and  divided  using  a  two-stage  riffle  splitter  and  then  pulverized  in  a  TM  Max  2 
pulverizer to produce 300 to 400 grams of a 90 percent passing 150-mesh pulp. Two duplicate

pulp sub-samples were produced in this manner. As a cleaning measure between each sample 
batch,  Skyline  passes  silica  rock  through  the  crushers  to  remove  any  potential  remaining 
material.  Pulverizers  also  are  cleaned  between  each  sample  batch.  Both  the  remaining  coarse 
reject and pulp samples were returned for secure storage to Wildcat in Harshaw and Patagonia. 
Crushed core rejects are stored dry in sealed 55-gallon barrels. Duplicate pulps are stored in two 
different  dry,  secure  locations.  In  July  2008,  PAH  visited  WSC-  Harshaw  field  facilities  and 
Skyline  laboratory  and  reviewed  all  of  their  processing  protocols  for  Hermosa’s  2007  –  2008 
drilling program and found them to be within industry standards. 
 
As  discussed  for  the  previous  pulp  re-assay  sampling,  all  pulps  were  analyzed  by  Skyline 
Laboratories  for  manganese,  copper,  lead,  and  zinc.  Gold  and  silver  were  subcontracted  by 
Skyline to Assayers Canada and were analyzed by fire assay on a 30-gram pulp charge, again 
with some necessary reduction in charge weight for high Mn oxide samples. Often the duplicate 
pulp  was  sent  to  Assayers  Canada.  Skyline  analyzed  manganese,  zinc,  and  lead  using 
inductively-coupled plasma (ICP), while copper was analyzed by atomic absorption (AA). Each 
of the analytical batches was subject to routine quality control programs both externally by WSC 
and internally by Skyline. 
 
For analytical work by both Skyline and Assayers Canada, a standard sample was inserted every 
20th sample as a check of assay accuracy, which with repeated analysis during the course of the 
analytical  program  also  served  as  a  check  of  assay  precision.  Standard  samples  for  the  pulp 
reanalysis program were prepared and certified by Mineral Exploration Group (MEG) in Reno, 
Nevada, using mineralized material from the Hermosa deposit. Standards were prepared at five 
grade values based on a systematic round-robin analytical program that included work by five 
different laboratories. Skyline also internally used routine Cu, Pb, and Zn standards and later in 
the program, a certified Mn standard. 
 
Both coarse-crushed preparation (marble material analyzed blank) and fine pulp blank samples 
(certified barren quartz sand) were included. Blanks were included at the beginning and end of 
each  sample  run  and  usually  every  30th  sample.  The  standards  and  blanks  served  as  quality 
control for silver, manganese, zinc, lead, copper, and gold analyses. 
 
In addition, approximately six percent of samples were checked by ALS-Chemex Labs for gold, 
silver,  manganese,  copper,  lead,  and  zinc  using  the  same  analytical  methods  as  Skyline  and 
Assayers Canada. Many of these checks were every 20th sample, often on the duplicate pulp, but 
checks on better grade samples and samples considered unusual were emphasized. In addition 
most of these check samples also had a Chemex 49 element ICP spectral scan for major, minor 
and  trace  elements.  A  few  sample  switches  and  clerical  errors  were  noted  and  corrected  at 
Skyline, Assayers Canada and Chemex but no systematic or significant problems were noted in 
the  quality  control  programs  results.  In  addition,  Assayers  Canada  ran  every  20th  sample  in 
duplicate for Au and Ag. 
 
ALS-Chemex  is  an  internationally  recognized  commercial  laboratory  in  Vancouver,  British 
Columbia, that has ISO-9001-2000 certification and is a registered British Columbia laboratory.

In  summary,  the  core  sample  handling,  preparation,  and  analysis  was  conducted  by  secure 
industry  standard  procedures  by  authorized  personnel.  Supervision,  oversight,  and  chain-of-
custody  recordation  was  provided  where  needed.  The  process  was  subject  to  routine  quality 
control procedures to ensure that the sample results were representative.

11.4 Wildcat Silver Analytical Program  - 2010 - 2012
2010-12 Drilling and Sampling Procedures.
In the 2010 – 2012 drilling program WSC completed 72 reverse circulation drill holes totaling 
49,443 feet and 58 core holes totaling 23 core holes totaling 31,994 feet (Table 10.1-1).  Samples 
from the drilling were collected and prepared on site, then shipped to Skyline Labs in Tucson for 
sample preparation.  Details of sample collection, preparation and shipping follow.
Core Sample Collection and Preparation
At the drill sites the core was placed in numbered waxed cardboard boxes holding 10 feet with 
wooden blocks indicating the ends of runs. Diamond drill core was collected from the drill rigs 
by a geologist or geo-technician once or twice daily.  At the logging facility the core was laid out 
in order, the box numbers and footages on the ends and lids with core blocks were checked for 
continuity/correctness.  Each  box  of  wet  core  was  then  photographed  digitally  with  a  tag 
indicating  Drill  hole  identification,  box  number,  footage  and  date.    Box  footages  were  later 
inventoried  and  entered  into  to  a  spreadsheet.    Each  core  box  was  then  weighed,  which  with 
contained interval and actual core recovery was used to estimate core density and tonnage factor. 
The core was then logged for geology, alteration, mineralization and other important features.
Prior to shipment to the lab the core was split in half lengthwise by technicians using a hydraulic 
splitter.  The  splitter  and  sample  trays  were  carefully  cleaned  with  brushes  after  each  sample 
interval.  The  core  was  typically  sampled  on  5-foot  intervals.  In  areas  of  mineralogical  or 
geologic interest, sampling often occurred at variable intervals ranging from 0.5 to 7 feet.
One-half of the core was returned to the original core box for reference and long term storage, 
the other half of the split core was placed in a heavy gauge plastic bag with the hole number and 
interval. These bags were sealed with a wire tie, weighed and consolidated in shipping boxes or 
bulk  shipping  bags.  Most  of  the  split  core  also  had  a  field  duplicate  taken  about  every  as  a 
quarter-split interval of core corresponding to the original half-split interval.  Sample intervals, 
sample  weights,  technician  who  split  the  core  and  other  sample  data  were  entered  into  excel 
spreadsheet in the splitting area.
QA/QC reference standards and blanks were inserted in the sample stream. During the 2010 – 
2012  program  6  different  reference  standards  were  randomly  inserted  at  approximately  every 
20th  sample.    One  reference  blank  (barren  volcanic  material)  was  inserted  about  every  50th

sample. The coarse-grained blanks were to test sample preparation procedures.  Sample batches 
were picked up by Skyline Labs once or sometimes twice a week by for transport to Tucson for 
sample preparation and analysis.
11-5
Reverse Circulation Sample Collection and Preparation
Samples from the reverse circulation drilling were collected at five foot intervals beginning at the 
surface with the hole cleaned and blown by the driller between each sample. Except for a few 
initial trial holes and hole collaring/casing to 5 to 20 feet the RC holes were drilled wet rather 
than dry.  Drill samples were run thru a cyclone and wet rotary splitter to obtain two identical 
sample splits, each weighing approximately 10-15 pounds.  These duplicate samples, an original 
and a duplicate (duplicates were marked with a “A” or “M” suffix) were placed in Tyvek sample 
bags.  Samples  were  collected  on  pallets,  shrink  wrapped  and  a  forklift  was  used  to  load  the 
pallets on a truck which transported the samples to the work site at Harshaw and Alta.
At the work site the samples were inventoried and individually weighed. The weight gives the 
recovery of the sample. Reference standards and blanks were inserted in the RC sample stream 
as with bagged split core. In addition in many of the sample batches the duplicate A or M sample 
was inserted as a field duplicate in the sample steam approximately every 20th sample. Samples 
were picked up by Skyline Labs and trucked to the lab facility in Tucson.
Eventually,  core  and  crushed  RC  drill  chip  rejects  and  pulps  are  returned  to  Harshaw  from 
Skyline with the pulps boxed and cataloged then stored in locked containers. The returned RC 
coarse rejects and the duplicate samples are stored on shrink wrapped pallets and stored under 
tarps.
Sample Preparation and Analysis
Sample  preparation  (crushing  &  pulverizing)  and  assaying  at  Skyline  labs  were  similar  or 
identical  to  that  in  previous  years.    Skyline  was  sent  a  paper  copy  of  the  sample  interval  list 
(including standards and blanks) with the work order during shipping. They were also E-mailed 
an electronic copy of the work order and sample list to expedite print of in-house sample labels.
Skyline  Labs  prepared  two  identical  250  gram  sample  pulps.  Skyline  regularly  assayed  for 
copper, lead, zinc and manganese. The second duplicate pulp was usually sent to a second lab for 
silver and gold fire assay. For the first month of the 2010 -2012 program Assayers Canada was 
used for the gold/silver analysis.  This was discontinued in January and the second pulp was then 
sent to Inspectorate Laboratories, Reno for gold/silver fire assay.
Pulps  were  analyzed  by  ICP  at  Skyline  for  percent  copper,  lead,  zinc,  and  manganese  after  a 
multi-acid digestion.  Inspectorate determined silver values by gravimetric fire assay with gold 
values determined by AA finish in the same dissolved dore bead.  Silver value is the weight of

the dore bead minus the weight of AA gold value.  In certain drill holes in the earlier part of the 
program and as QA/QC checks Skyline assayed certain pulps for Ag by AA with overages of 
150 ppm repeated by gravimetric fire assay with gravimetric gold subtracted.  Au was by fire 
assay-1 AT/AA finish. At both Inspectorate and Skyline if the gravimetric FA/AA Au value was 
greater than 3 gpt (grams per ton) the assay was repeated by FA gravimetric methods.  Certain 
duplicate  pulps  also  have  Cu,  Pb,  Zn,  Mn  QA/QC  checks  using  an  ICP/AA  methods  and  30 
element spectral ICP determined after a 4-acid digestion.
11-6
Remaining portions of the core and all assay pulps are stored in shelved, locked in secure 40-foot 
ocean shipping containers on property owned by WSC or on land owned by a neighboring ranch 
which  WSC  rents.    The  two  areas  used  by  WSC  for  sample  storage/core  logging  is  under 
constant  surveillance  by  local  land  owners,  WSC  personnel  and  contractors  and/or  by  the  US 
Border Patrol, who is in charge of federal security in the area. Additional security is provided by 
locked gates and stationary game cameras. No evidence of sample tampering has been noted.

12.0  Data Verification
12-1
This section discusses the methods and results of WSC’s effort to verify the historic ASARCO 
sample  data.  It  is  concluded  that  the  data  provided  by  WSC  (inclusive  of  relevant  ASARCO 
sample  data)  is  of  sufficient  quality  for  use  in  a  resource  estimate  consistent  with  Canadian 
reporting standards.
12.1  Wildcat Silver Pulp Re-assay 
All  available  pulp  material  from  the  previous  ASARCO  drill  hole  analytical  work  was 
reanalyzed  in  2006  and  included  4,272  pulps.  WSC’s  pulp  re-assay  program  was  designed  to 
replace  ASARCO  assay  results  when  possible,  complete  assays  for  elements  that  were  not 
analyzed previously or only analysed by XRF and to provide a means of verifying the quality of 
ASARCO assay results for samples where no pulps currently exist. 
 
Table 12.1-1 compares the number of new and old assays of ASARCO pulps that exist in the 
current  drill  hole  database.  For  elements  other  than  silver,  over  90  percent  of  the  data  was 
generated by WSC’s re-assay program. For silver, this total is 77 percent due to a larger number 
of original ASARCO silver values from pulps that were not available for re-assay.

As  the  drill  hole  database  used  for  the  current  resource  estimate  still  contains  a  number 
ASARCO assays, it was important to confirm the validity of these results. To achieve this, WSC 
compared  new  and  old  assay  pairs.  This  analysis  is  detailed  in  the  2008  Technical  Report 
(Pincock, Allen & Holt, 2008). As a result, this work tends to confirm the general viability of the 
previous sample analysis values and supports the practice of using older analytical data where 
newer analytical data is not available. ACA concurs with this observation.
12.2  Wildcat Silver Comparative Drilling 
While  WSC’s  re-assay  program  serves  to  verify  ASARCO’s  analytical  results,  it  did  not 
necessarily provide information about the quality and representativeness of the original drill hole 
material  used  for  assaying.  To  investigate  this  issue,  WSC  conducted  a  twin  hole  drilling 
program  in  2007,  detailed  in  the  Technical  Report  of  August  7,  2008.  In  this  program,  WSC 
drilled  four  diamond  drill  holes  proximal  to  existing  ASARCO  air-hammer  holes.  Core  was

sampled, prepared and assayed per current industry standard methods that included a rigorous 
QA/QC program. Comparison of assay results for twin hole pairs demonstrated similar results. 
Based on this comparison, it is concluded that quality of ASARCO samples is acceptable. 
 
Separation distances between drill holes ranged from 7 to 28 feet as shown in Table 12.2-1. All 
new  holes  were  surveyed  down-the-hole  for  directional  deviation  using  a  Reflex  EZ-Shot 
magnetic survey tool. The results did not show evidence of consistent grade difference (bias) and 
the variability that was observed is concluded to reflect natural short range grade differences in 
the deposit, rather than deficiencies in air hammer chip or drill core recoveries.

The  results  of  the  comparative  drilling  are  summarized  in  Table  12.2-2.  Both  sets  of  holes 
intercepted  similar  material,  characterized  by  mineralization  that  is  the  result  of  the  complete 
oxidation  of  original  sulfide  replacements  in  the  host  rock.  Due  to  the  nature  of  this 
mineralization,  drilling  results  are  subject  to  natural  geologic  variation  from  vugs,  fracture 
rubble, and mineral remobilization. Mineralized intervals were intercepted at very similar depths 
down  hole  and  had  very  similar  total  interval  lengths.  It  is  noted  that  the  top  contact  of  the 
mineralization is typically sharp, while the lower contact is typically more gradational.

The sampling results for all metals show grade values similarly elevated to higher levels within 
the mineralized interval. Some variability is observed in the average metal values between the 
drill hole pairs, with the newer core hole sometimes being higher in value and sometimes lower. 
There is no evidence of consistent grade difference (bias) and PAH and ACA concluded that the 
variability reflects natural short range grade differences in the deposit rather than deficiencies in 
air hammer chip or drill core recoveries. 
 
The comparisons did not reflect any systematic bias between the older air-hammer holes and the 
newer core holes. Quality control work, using standards and blanks, supported the quality of the 
new  analyses,  both  air-hammer  and  core.  As  a  result,  this  newer  work  confirms  the  general 
viability of the previous air-hammer drill results for use in resource estimation work.
12.3  Additional Data Validation 
Further data validation has included a review of core logging procedures, examination of some 
of the core, and review of assay sheets and logs and confirmed the similarity of multiple data 
sources. Much old drill core, chip boards and chip sample vials from the air-hammer holes were 
preserved by ASARCO for examination. The examination of drill core found that the observed 
intensity of mineralization was consistent with recorded laboratory analytical grades. 
 
The  WSC  drilling  has  well-marked  cemented  hole  collar  positions  in  the  field  as  do  many 
ASARCO  holes  including  projecting,  cemented  casing  with  hole  number-stamped  metal  tags. 
Some  older  ASARCO  holes  were  observed  as  surface  depressions  around  old  drill  cuttings 
sometimes accompanied by old weathered stakes or rotted wooden hole plugs, sometimes with 
relict  metal  tags.  In  a  few  places,  drill  road  reconstruction  exposed  the  trace  of  holes  from 
ASARCO drilling. All known hole collar positions have been resurveyed by a licensed Arizona 
registered  land  surveyor.  The  WSC  drill  holes  have  all  been  surveyed  downhole  for  hole 
deviation using acceptable magnetic surveying procedures.
12.4   Quality Control (“QC”) program  
Analytical  Solutions  Ltd  (“ASL”)  reviewed  the  assay  Quality  Control  (“QC”)  program  for 
approximately  36,000  samples  submitted  in  2011  prior  to  July.    Data  were  provided  in  Excel 
spreadsheets by Wildcat Silver Corporation.  ASL has not performed any validation of the data 
with regards to data entry or transfer from laboratory files. 
 
There  is  no  evidence  of  systematic  silver  contamination  based  on  coarse  blanks  that  were 
inserted  157  times  with  sample  batches.    One  significant  QC  failure  was  recognized  (sample 
HDS-120 150B) where a sample switch is suspected and repeat assays were recommended.  
 
A total of six different standards were submitted 796 times for Ag and Au and 829 times for Mn, 
Pb, Zn and Cu.  Standards were prepared by MEG, Nevada in 2006.

Twenty cases of the 29 listed Ag QC failures are most likely related to incorrectly recording the 
designation for the standard either in the database or drill logs and do not require any follow up.   
 
Gold,  Zn  and  Cu  values  for  the  standards  are  not  at  economically  significant  grades  but 
laboratory results were relatively consistent.  Manganese values for the standards range from 0.2 
to  10.1%  and  the  laboratories  reported  results  biased  5  to  20%  low.    Lead  values  for  the 
standards range from 0.1 to 6.4% and results do not appear biased. 
 
Certificates are not available for the MEG standards and it is possible that the materials have 
degraded  over  time.    Additional  test  work  on  the  standards  to  verify  consensus  values  is  in 
progress.  It has been recommended that commercially available reference materials are used in 
future programs.  
 
Silver check assays for silver were done at Skyline Laboratories on 242 pulps.  There is only 
broad correspondence between the two sets of silver results by aqua regia with an AAS finish 
(Figure 12.4-1). This may be partially related to differences in the acid digestion used at Skyline 
and  Inspectorate  Laboratories.    The  fire  assay  silver  data  greater  than  10  oz/ton  demonstrate 
strong agreement.  It is possible that the Inspectorate Laboratory silver fire assays are biased low, 
which was also suggested by the results for the MEG standards.

13.0  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
13.1 Introduction 
 
Wildcat  Silver  Corporation  intends  to  develop  the  Hermosa  property  in  southern  Arizona  for 
silver, copper, zinc, and manganese production. In addition to the Hermosa Manto materials, a 
new silver bearing zone has been identified as a leachable silver zone (Upper Silver Zone). Very 
preliminary test work has been performed on this new material and is discussed in this section of 
the resource update.  
 
At this time no additional reportable testwork has been completed on the Hermosa Manto ore 
zones.  The  previous  work  performed  by  Hazen  Research,  Inc.  was  done  in  two  preliminary 
stages of laboratory testing for process development. This information was incorporated into the 
previously published Preliminary Economic Assessment dated June 2, 2010, and is incorporated 
by reference into this Resource Update.

13.2 Initial Upper Silver Zone Material Leach Tests  
Resource Development Inc. Test Work 2012
The 2010 – 2012 WSC drilling program identified a very consistent silver-bearing zone (Upper 
Silver Zone) located stratigraphically above and adjacent to the Manto replacement zone.  Silver 
values in this zone range from 0.5 opt up to 25.0 opt silver, while the other metals common in the 
deposit are found in only minor amounts.  Based on the potential size and grade of this resource, 
metallurgical  testing  was  implemented  to  determine  if  this  material  could  be  mined  and 
beneficiated at a profit.  To that end, Resource Development Inc. of Wheat Ridge Colorado was 
contracted  to  test  representative  samples  from  the  Upper  Silver  Zone  to  determine  the  silver 
extraction by direct cyanidation.
To date, approximately 80 drill samples of the leachable silver material (Upper Silver Zone) with 
silver grades ranging from 0.5 opt up to 25.0 opt and with varying grades of Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, and 
sulfur concentrations have been leached in bottle roll tests. None of the other elements present 
appear to have influenced the silver recovery.
The silver recoveries varied significantly from a low of 8.5% to a high of 91.6%. The results of 
the  bottle  roll test  indicate  that  the  recoveries  observed  are  very  sensitive  to  grind  size  in the

initial tests.  Silver recoveries on unprocessed RC drill cuttings (+/- 0.5 inch) were doubled when 
ground  to  74  microns.    Test  work  continues  on  these  ores  to  improve  recoveries.    Work  in 
progress includes fine grinding tests and thiosulfate leach tests.
The  incorporation  of  this  material  into  the  previously  defined  processing  scenario  has  not  yet 
been determined, but will likely include crushing and grinding to 74 microns or less, followed by 
standard cyanide leaching, and Merrill Crowe silver recovery.

14.0  Mineral Resources 
 
The mineral resources of the Hermosa deposit are sub-divided into three types:  The manto zone, the 
Upper Silver Zone and the deep sulfide skarn zone.  All three are included in the update to the last 
resource estimate (presented in the PEA report dated October 2010) .  The mineral resource is being 
updated  because  there  has  been  substantial  additional  drilling  completed  since  the  October  2010 
mineral resource and the Upper Silver Zone is a new mineral resource type which was not reported in 
October 2010. 
 
14.1  Summary 
 
The mineral resource is tabulated using a block model with a block size of 50 x 50 feet (ft) in plan and 
20 ft vertically.  All tonnages are reported in short tons (tons) which equal 2,000 pounds per ton.  The 
silver, manganese, zinc, copper and lead grades are estimated from 216 drill holes comprising 150,702 
feet of drill length using an inverse distance to the 5th power estimation procedure.  The basis for the 
selection of this estimation procedure is discussed later in this section. 
 
The Hermosa mineral resources are tabulated within an open pit geometry for the manto, Upper Silver 
Zone and portions of the skarn zone based on estimates of costs, metal recoveries and the following 
metal prices:  $25.76/oz silver, $0.60/lb manganese, $0.93/lb zinc and $3.21/lb copper.  The potential 
underground resource below the pit mineral resource is defined as a contiguous geometry above a $55 
value per ton cutoff grade.  Table 14.1-1 is a summary of the mineral resource tonnage.

Drilling & Assaying 
 
Drilling and assaying statistics for the drillhole data base used to construct the model are summarized 
in Table 14.2-1. Drillholes are segregated using the “type” variable (type1 = core, type2 = RC, type3 = 
rotary, type4 = combined rotary/core). 
 
Table 14.2-2 summarizes the percentage of total intervals assayed by element and hole type. Assaying 
is reasonably complete except for zinc, copper, lead and manganese assays in the rotary and combined 
holes, where the assaying for these metals was done mostly in intervals of higher silver. This selective 
assaying could tend to generate high-biased zinc, copper, lead and manganese composites.  
 
398 of the silver assays and 1,219 of the manganese assays have values of zero. If these are default 
values  entered  in  unassayed  intervals,  then  the  percentage  of  total  intervals  assayed  shown  in Table 
14.2-2 decreases to 94.2 percent  for silver and to 85.0 percent for manganese. The impact of entering 
zero default values in unassayed intervals will be to generate low-biased composites.

Of the 25,948 total assay intervals in the data base only 19,765 are assayed for all four elements of 
economic interest (silver, zinc, copper and manganese). As discussed in Section 14.3.7, this probably 
results in underestimation of recovered values in the model.  
 
Approximately 29 percent (7,173 out of 24,848) of the silver assays are assigned values of 0.15 oz/t – 
which  is  the  lower  detection  limit  value  during  the  earlier  phases  of  assaying.  This  results  in 
overestimation  of  the  economic  contribution  of  silver  (0.15  oz/t  silver  generates  $3.29/t  recovered 
value) because most of the samples assigned 0.15 oz/t values likely have silver grades lower than 0.15 
oz/t.  
 
Assay intervals range from 0.1 ft to 260 ft with an average of 5.46 ft. There are some holes with single 
grades entered over very long intervals (notably H-1920, which has silver assays from 0 to 1,000 ft but 
which contains only nine assay intervals and only five unique silver values. The interval from 0-400ft 
runs 0.09 oz/t). 
 
The locations of the holes used for the mineral resource estimate are shown in Figure 14.2-1. Holes are 
dominantly vertical, and hole spacing over the main part of the deposit ranges from 50 ft to several 
hundred feet with an average of approximately 150 ft. However, gaps in the drill coverage combined 
with incomplete assaying leave parts of the deposit inadequately tested. 
 
In  constructing  the  mineral  resource  model,  IMC  has  assumed  that  the  data  supplied  by  Wildcat, 
including assay, survey and topographic data, are correct to within normally-accepted limits of error. 
The assay data has been reviewed by Lynda Bloom and her observations are included in Sections 11 
and 12.

The silver grade distribution is lognormal when the “flat spot” generated by the large number of 0.15 
oz/t  default  values  is  ignored,  but  zinc,  manganese  and  lead  exhibit  inflections  around  the  90th 
percentile. These inflections are potentially diagnostic of separate high-grade zinc, manganese and lead 
populations. 
 
Recovered value/ton in 20 ft composites was calculated using the metal price and recovery assumptions

recoveries used in the October 2010 PEA with adjustments to metal prices.  The recoveries and metal 
prices were further refined prior to the tabulation of the mineral resource in Table 14.1-1.  Figure 14.2-

economic interest.

The Figure 14.2-3 plot has been smoothed by recompositing with the 0.15 oz/ton default silver assays 
removed. Without the distortions introduced by these values, the plot exhibits a pronounced inflection 
around $150, again indicating the presence of separate high- and low-grade populations. As shown in 
Figure 14.2-2, however, the separate populations are present in zinc, manganese and lead but not in 
silver. (It is not clear whether copper contains separate populations, but copper contributes only a small 
amount to total recovered value.)

Geologic and Other Data 
 
The  assay  data  base  contains  three  lithology  variables:  “lith”,  which  codes  assay  intervals  into  18 
different units; “lithc”, which combines these 18 units into three main units (Cretaceous volcaniclastics, 
Permian sediments and “Ore Zone” units); and “orezone”, which defines essentially the same ore zone 
units  as  lithc  but  not  the  surrounding  lithologies.    Figure  14.2-4  is  a  cumulative  frequency  plot  of 
recovered value probabilities in the three lithc units. Grades in the “Ore Zone” units are much higher 
than in the host rock units, but 20 percent of the composites in the “Ore Zone” units have recovered 
values  below  the  $45/ton  cutoff  and  5-10  percent  of  the  composites  in  the  host  rock  units  have 
recovered  values  exceeding  $45/ton.    The  $45/ton  value  is  used  for  comparison  as  it  was  an  early 
estimate of a process cost, which has subsequently been lowered.

rhyolite or manganese oxide (two units). There was no ore zone code in lith, and as shown in Figure 
14.2-5,  the  ozone  codes  do  not  adequately  segregate  the  composites  into  high-grade  and  low-grade 
populations.  Only  50  percent  of  the  composites  inside  the  manganese  oxide  zones  exceed  the  $45 
cutoff, and statistical reviews not reported here confirm that none of the contacts between the different 
ozone units qualifies statistically as a grade estimation hard boundary.

14.3  Mineral Resource Model 
 
Model Dimensions 
 
The IMC model extends from 163000N, 1071500E to 172800N, 1080500E, and from the 6220 to 1800 
elevation. With a block size of 50 x 50 x 20 ft vertical it contains 180 columns, 196 rows and 219 tiers 
for a total of 7,726,320 blocks. 
 
 
Mineralized Trends, Geologic Controls 
 
Mineralization  at  Hermosa  occurs  in  manto-type  replacement  bodies  located  mostly  in  the  Permian 
sediments  near  their  contact  with  the  overlying  Cretaceous  volcaniclastics.  There  are  some  local 
variations in the dip of the mantos but the overall trend is sub-horizontal. The mantos also tend to be 
discontinuous,  with  higher-grade  stringers  occurring  both  above  and  below.  These  features  are 
illustrated on Figure 14.3-1, which shows 20 ft composite recovered values/ton in drillholes along east-
west  section  168200N,  which  runs  through  the  approximate  center  of  the  deposit.  Intervals  with  no 
values (composite interval is blank) are those where assays were not run for all four of the elements 
that contribute to recovered value, namely silver, zinc, copper and manganese. For example, hole HDS-
30 near the center of the section, is assayed only for silver and hole HDS-056 (just east of 1,075,500E) 
is assayed for silver and sporadically for manganese. Hole HDS-049 at the east edge of the drilling is 
assayed for silver and manganese but not for copper and zinc). 
 
Mineralization extends above the manto replacement and to the east in a silver rich, base metal poor 
area  referred  to  as  the  Upper  Silver  Zone.   The  mineralization  also  extends  below  the  manto  zone. 
During  the  evaluation  of  statistics  and  the  grade  estimates,  all  areas  were  estimated  with  the  same 
modeling  parameters.    As  the  project  moves  forward  and  more  understanding  of  the  various 
mineralized areas, these metal grades in these areas may be estimated differently.

Geologic controls were not used during grade estimation because the lithology variables in the model 
do not adequately segregate the composites into higher-grade and lower-grade populations. 
 
 
Variograms and Search Parameters 
 
Covariance variograms run on 20 ft silver, copper, manganese and recovered value composites showed 
horizontal ranges consistently in excess of 200 ft with no sign of directional anisotropy. (Zinc showed 
longer ranges in the vertical direction. The reasons for this were not investigated.) The omnidirectional  
variograms for silver, zinc, copper and manganese (unfitted) are shown in Figure 14.3-2 for reference.

30 ft vertical. 
 
 
Modeling Approaches 
 
Six different models were constructed to determine how sensitive resource estimates were to modeling 
approach and to identify the optimum modeling approach for the deposit. 
 
1. The NNP model. Nearest-neighbor polygons run on recovered value composites with no boundary 
constraints. 
 
2. The OK model. Ordinary-kriging run on recovered value composites with no boundary constraints, 
using a minimum/maximum of 1/10 composites, a nugget of 1,000, a sill of 6,000 and a range of 400 ft.  
 
3. The IK30 model. Indicator kriging run on recovered value composites at a $30 discriminator to target 
the $45 cutoff (discriminator grades are set lower than the target grade to avoid under smearing) using

2/10 minimum/maximum composites and the Figure 14.3-3 variogram to delimit blocks above the $45 
cutoff. Silver, zinc etc. grades were estimated only inside these blocks using only composites inside the 
blocks using inverse distance cubed (ID3) and 1/10 minimum/maximum composites. Grades in other 
blocks were set to zero. 
 
(Note:  The  IK  runs  used  an  expanded  recovered  value  data  base.  Because  of  incomplete  assaying, 
recovered value can be reliably calculated in only 4,972 of the 7,723 composites in the data base, too 
few for robust IK estimates. Partially-assayed composites were therefore assigned silver, zinc, copper 
or manganese values as follows:
•  Estimate silver, zinc, copper and manganese grades in the model using ID2 
•  “Dip” composites that are unassayed for silver, zinc, copper or manganese into the model 
•  Assign these composites the silver, zinc, copper or manganese grades in the model blocks the
composites intersect.
This  procedure  increased  the  number  of  composites  with  recovered  value  estimated  from  4,972  to 
6,655. However, these added composites were only used in the IK runs. They were not used to estimate 
silver, zinc, copper, manganese or lead grades.) 
 
4. The IK100 model. Indicator kriging run on recovered value composites at a $100 discriminator to 
target the +$150 population (Figure 14.2-3), using 2/10 minimum/maximum composites and the Figure 
8  variogram,  in  order  to  constrain  these  higher-grade  composites.  Silver,  zinc  etc.  grades  were 
estimated  only  inside  these  blocks  using  only  composites  inside  the  blocks  using  ID3  and  1/10  
minimum/ maximum composites. Grades outside the blocks were estimated using ID3 and  the same 
composite parameters but without boundary constraints. 
 
5.  The  IK30100  model.  A  combination  of  IK30  and  IK100,  with  silver,  zinc  etc.  grades  estimated 
separately inside the IK30 and IK100 shapes using ID3 and grades outside these shapes set to zero. 
 
(Note: The IK runs performed well in segregating the composites into statistically-distinct domains. In 
the  IK30100  model  98  percent  of  the  composites  inside  the  IK100  shapes  have  recovered  values 
exceeding $100, 91 percent of the composites inside the IK30 shapes and outside the IK100 shapes 
have recovered values of between $30 and $100 and only 4 percent of the composites outside the IK30 
shapes have values exceeding $30.) 
 
6.  The  ID5  model.  Based  on  the  Figure  14.2-2  probability  plots,  zinc,  manganese  and  lead  were 
estimated  separately  inside  and  outside  the  IK100  shapes  using  ID5,  1/10  minimum/maximum 
composites inside the shapes and 2/10 outside, and silver and copper were estimated using  ID5  and 
2/10 minimum/ maximum composites without boundary constraints. ID5 was selected because IMC's 
experience  on  other  properties  indicates  that  higher-power  inverse  distance  operators  are  usually 
needed to replicate blast hole grade distributions and because ID5 “splits the difference” between the 
NNP and OK models.

1.  The OK model is over smeared, i.e. it overstates tons and understates grade.
2.  The NNP model is under smeared, i.e. it understates tons and overstates grade.
3.  The  IK30  model  gives  essentially  the  same  results  as  the  NNP  model,  indicating  that  it  also 
under smears (probably because the $30 IK discriminator over confines the low-grade around 
the  $45  cutoff.  Note  that  there  is  no  grade-population  justification  for  this  discriminator.  It 
simply targets the cutoff grade as used during the modeling exercise).
4.  The IK 100 model gives lower tons than any other IK model, probably because the $100 IK 
boundary over confines the high-grade silver and because the ID3 operator over smears grades 
outside the $100 IK boundary.
5.  The IK30100 model gives essentially the same results as the NNP and the IK30 models.
6.  The ID5 model gives the most representative results. It contains more blocks above cutoff than 
the  IK100  model  and  about  the  same  number  as  the  NNP,  IK30  and  IK30100  models,  but 
recovered  value  are  significantly  lower.  This  would  be  a  logical  expectation  given  that  the 
IK100 shapes limit the influence of the higher-grade zinc and manganese in the ID5 model.

The results of the ID5 model are summarized in Figure 14.3-4, which plots recovered value/ton  along 
the  168,200N  section  line  (drillhole  composite  recovered  values  on  this  section  line  are  shown  in 
Figure 14.3-1).

An issue affecting all the models is incomplete assaying, which results in blocks being assigned silver 
grades but no zinc, copper or manganese grades, or silver and manganese grades but no zinc or copper 
grades etc. Of the 151,742 blocks in the ID5 model that are estimated for recovered value only 119,911 
(79  percent)  are  estimated  for  silver,  zinc,  copper  and  manganese.  The  remaining  21  percent  are 
assigned recovered values that ignore the economic contribution of one or more of these four elements. 
As  a  result  the  ID5  model  will  tend  to  underestimate  the  in-place  value  of  the  resource.  Potential 
impacts are discussed later in this section.

Tonnage Estimation 
 
Tonnages  were  estimated  based  on  model  lithology  codes  and  on  the  results  of  46  specific  gravity 
measurements on drill core samples, 36 of which were from holes included in the drillhole data base.   
 
Table  14.3-2  summarizes  the  results  of  the  specific  gravity  measurements  relative  to  the  “Upper 
Volcanics”, which are referred to as either “Cretaceous volcaniclastics” or “rhyolites” in the data base, 
the “Lower Sediments”, which are referred to as either “limestone/marble” or “Paleozoic sedimentary”, 
and the “Ore Zone Units”, which are referred to as either “ore zone rock types”, “Mn-oxide” or “calc-
silicate skarn”.

There is a density contrast between the Upper Volcanics and the Lower Sediments but not between the 
Lower Sediments and the Ore Zone units. (The density increases caused by heavy mineral species in 
the Ore Zone units appear to be offset by an increase in vugs.)  The Ore Zone units are also located 
dominantly below the Upper Volcanic/Lower Sediment contact.  All blocks in the Upper Volcanics, as 
defined by the “lith” codes in the model, were therefore assigned a specific gravity of 2.54 g/cc (12.6 
cu ft/ton) and all blocks in the Lower Sediments, including Ore Zone blocks, were assigned a specific 
gravity of 2.70 g/cc (11.9 cu ft/ton). 
 
 
Resource Classification 
 
Resources were classified based on drill holes with a recovered value/ton value, with recovered value 
estimated only in composites with all silver, zinc, copper and manganese values present. 
 
Resources  are  classified  as  indicated  when  there  is  a  minimum  of  three  holes  with  recovered  value 
composites within the 250 x 250 x 30 ft search ellipsoid and as inferred when there are fewer  than 
three. No measured resources are defined at this time, in part due to the amount of drill intervals with 
missing assays for one or more of the metals. Figure 14.3-5, which plots model block classifications 
along section 168,200N, shows that these criteria give visually reasonable results, with indicated blocks 
located internal to the drilling and inferred blocks on the periphery.

The three-hole criterion is also supported by kriging variances, which are a measure of the errors to 
which  individual  block  grade  estimates  are  subject.  Figure  14.3-6,  which  plots  kriging  variance 
(obtained from an IK run applied to recovered value composites) against the number of drillholes in the 
search, shows kriging variances increase gradually as the number of holes within the search decreases 
from ten to three but increase more rapidly as the number falls below three. This inflection defines the 
three-hole  minimum  as  a  reasonable  confidence  threshold  for  segregating  inferred  and  indicated 
material. 
 
All model blocks coded as indicated in the model can be regarded as indicated for silver, zinc, copper, 
manganese and recovered value. Some blocks coded as inferred for recovered value would qualify as 
indicated for silver, zinc, copper or manganese, or for some combination thereof depending on which 
elements were assayed in the surrounding holes, but no attempt was made to define these blocks.

The grades and recovered values listed in Table 14.3-3 are, however, biased low by the un-estimated 
blocks  that  are  assigned  grades  of  zero  for  lead,  zinc,  copper  when  the  composites  in  the  nearby

change in indicated blocks, but grades and recovered values increase by about 10 percent in inferred

The Hermosa mineral resources are tabulated within an open pit geometry for the manto, Upper Silver 
Zone  and  portions  of  the  skarn  zone  based  on  estimates  of  costs,  metal recoveries  and  metal  prices 
presented  in Table  14.4-1.   The  metal  recoveries  used  in Table  14.2-4  were  preliminary  and  further 
refinement of them was done during the course of the definition of the mineral resource.  The metal 
recoveries  in  Table  14.4-1  and  the  cost  information  was  the  best  available  at  the  time  the  mineral 
resource was calculated.  The potential open pit resource was defined by a floating cone algorithm and 
the potential underground resource was defined as material below the bottom of the open pit by 80 feet 
and  contiguous  in  plan  with  a  minimum  net  value  of  $55/t.   The  costs  and  recoveries  are  based  on 
information from the October 2010 PEA and more recent metallurgical and process work. 
 
It is assumed that the manto and skarn mineral resources will be processed by SO2 leach followed by 
metal extraction from the concentrate by methods described in Sections 13 and 17.  The Upper Silver 
Zone material will be processed for silver only as the base metal grades are too low.  Table 14.4-2 is a 
summary of the mineral resource by the mineral zones.

16.0  Mining Methods
The  October  2010  PEA  was  based  on  a  different  mineral  resource  and  thus  the  mine  plan 
presented at that time is no longer valid, although the mining approach will still be a combined 
open pit and underground operation.  Presented below is the introduction to the mining section of 
the October 2010 PEA and the tonnage that was to be mined with that mine plan.   
 
The  Hardshell  (now  Hermosa)  deposit  will  be  extracted  using  a  combination  of  open  pit  and 
underground  mining  methods.  Open  pit  mining  will  provide  67  percent  of  the  ore  while  long 
holestoping  will  provide  the  bulk  of  the  underground  ore.    During  the  first  four  years  of 
operation, the open pit will produce all of the ore processed.   In  year five, underground mine 
production will begin at a rate of 1,560 tons per day (tpd) and the open pit production rate will be 
reduced to 2,440 tpd.  These rates will remain unchanged throughout the remainder of the project 
life and the underground and open pit mines will be exhausted simultaneously in year 18.   
 
The mine plan of the October 2010 PEA assumed a total of 23.8 million tons would be delivered 
to the process plant during the 18 years of operation, with 7.8 million coming from underground 
and 16.0 million tons coming from the open pit.  The current resource has greatly expanded the 
open pit potential, thus at some point in the future the PEA will have to be updated for the new 
mineral resource.

17.1 Introduction 
 
Wildcat  Silver  Corporation  (WSC)  intends  to  develop  the  Hermosa  property  in  southern 
Arizona  for  silver,  copper,  zinc,  and  manganese  production.  To-date  metallurgical  tests  have 
been  limited  to  bench-scale  testing  of  both  the  Manto  and  Upper  Silver  Zone  leach  ores.  
Through  this  testing  a  flow  sheet  has  been  developed  that  will  treat  the  Hermosa  ores  with 
acceptable recoveries and costs.  However, until current metallurgical testwork to optimize the 
processing flow sheet and a pilot plant has been successfully operated it is premature to publish 
a detailed processing plant description. 
 
Based on the metallurgical test work to-date a process flow sheet was developed for the purpose 
of  the  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  dated  26  October,  2010,  and  is  incorporated  by 
reference into this Resource Update.

18.0  Project Infrastructure 
 
The  Hermosa  property  is  part  of  the  Harshaw  and  Patagonia  Mining  Districts  located  in  the 
Patagonia Mountains of Santa Cruz County, Arizona (Figure 6.1-1). Hermosa is located six miles 
southeast of the town of Patagonia, which has a population of approximately 1,000 people. The 
property is located 15  miles northeast of the Santa Cruz county seat at Nogales  and 50 miles 
southeast  of  the  nearest  large  commercial  center  of  Tucson,  in  adjacent  Pima  County.  The 
international border with the State of Sonora, Mexico is eight miles to the south. The property 
covers about 2.6 miles in a north-south direction and about 3.0 miles in an east-west direction.
18.1  Existing Infrastructure 
The  Hermosa  project  is  situated  with  good  access  and  sources  of  water,  power  and  trained 
workforce.   
 
Access 
 
Access  to  the  property  is  either  from  Tucson  or  Nogales  to  the  town  of  Patagonia.  From 
Patagonia, a county road, mostly paved, leads six miles to the former town site of Harshaw.  An 
interconnecting  system  of  USFS-numbered  road  network,  originally  constructed  largely  for 
exploration, mining and ranching; exists around Harshaw and the district; but only major arteries 
are maintained by the county. 
 
Water 
 
Historically,  significant  amounts  of  ground  water  have  been  produced  for  mining  and  milling 
from  the  Harshaw  Creek  drainage  and  the  Hermosa  property  itself  without  diminishing  local 
ranch  and  domestic  supplies.  The  local  base  level  of  the  water  table  is  around  4,850  feet 
elevation at Harshaw. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS regularly monitor 
stream  flow  and  water  quality  in  the  district  and  region.    Hermosa  and  the  local  area  of  the 
Harshaw  Creek  drainage  are  not  part  of  an  Arizona  Department  of  Water  Resources  Active 
Management Area. 
 
Available information supports the assumption that adequate water supplies are available within 
a reasonable distance from the property.
Workforce
Southern Arizona hosts several major mining districts and the local area has several large active 
mines.  Experienced,  skilled  workers  are  readily  available  within  a  reasonable  commuting 
distance.

Commercial Resources and Services
18-2
Resources  in  the  town  of  Patagonia  are  limited.  The  town  has  a  high  school,  a  hotel,  several 
restaurants  and  bed  &  breakfasts,  a  small  grocery  store  and  a  gas  station.  The  town  is  not  a 
significant  source  of  supplies  or  services.  Nogales,  20  miles  southwest  of  Patagonia,  is  the 
county seat for Santa Cruz County. With a population of about 20,000, Nogales is large enough 
to serve as a supply and service center for most needs. Nogales has rail freight service, and a 
small commercial airport.  
 
Tucson, just over 65 miles to the north, has historically been the commercial and service/supply 
center  for  one  of  the  world’s  largest  mining  districts.  Tucson  has  a  full-service  commercial 
airport and is a large rail center.
Social Services and Security
Patagonia has K-12 schools and a well-stocked town library.  
 
Patagonia has a small police force which is supplemented by the Santa Cruz County Sherriff and 
the Arizona Highway Patrol to help maintain order.  Additionally, the U.S. Border Patrol has a 
strong presence in the area as drug trafficking and illegal immigration are a concern throughout 
Southern Arizona. 
 
Patagonia  has  a  small  family  medical  facility  and  EMT  service  associated  with  the  Fire 
Department and helicopter landing facilities.  
 
Nogales  has  a  small  regional  hospital.  Serious  cases  are  transported  to  one  of  Tucson’s  large 
hospitals by ambulance or helicopter. 
 
Power 
 
A 13.8 kV power line follows Harshaw Creek from west of Patagonia to the old town site of 
Harshaw and  continues  on to the San Rafael Valley. Higher capacity power lines traverse the 
Sonoita  Creek  Valley  from  Huachuca  City  to  Sonoita-Elgin  and  Patagonia  from  the  east.    A 
major regional natural gas pipeline, owned and operated by El Paso Natural Gas transports gas 
from Nogales to the northeast in the Sonoita Valley where is tapped for use. A trunk phone line 
(Qwest) follows the Harshaw Creek Road with phone service available in Harshaw. Cell phone 
service is good in the Patagonia-Harshaw area with cell towers on Red Mountain.
18.2  Project Layout 
The project infrastructure is still in the planning stages, but will initially be comprised of an open 
pit (with a later underground) mine, mine waste rock storage areas, process plant with associated 
tailings disposal area and the necessary shops and warehousing areas to support the operation.  
As the flow sheet for the process plant is finalized, the project infrastructure layout and size will 
be developed.

20.0  Permitting and Environmental Considerations  
 
Currently  WSC  is  in  the  advanced  exploration  stage  on  the  Hermosa  Project.    Below  is  a 
discussion of the various permitting, environmental and social issues being considered during the 
exploration phases as well as during the mining phases, in the event the project advances to that 
stage. 
 
20.1 Current Exploration Programs 
 
WSC 2010 – 2012 Drilling Programs 
 
To-date  all  WSC  drilling  has  been  confined  to  lands  owned  fee  simple  by  the  Company.  
Extreme  care  has  been  taken  to  follow  all  applicable  state  and  federal  laws  that  apply  to 
exploration drilling and the abandonment and reclamation of roads, drill pads and drill holes. 
 
All  drill  holes,  excepting  those  used  for  monitor  wells,  have  been  abandoned  according  to 
guidelines set by the state of Arizona.  Plastic-lined sumps used to catch drill cuttings have been 
abandoned  appropriately  by  disposing  of  the  cuttings  and  filling  the  sumps  with  soil  with 
subsequent recontouring and seeding.  Abandoned access roads and drill spurs will be reclaimed 
as  the  current  program  comes  to  a  close  in  April.    These  roads  will  be  brought  to  original 
contour, be water barred for erosion and then reseeded with natural vegetation as recommended 
by the Coronado National Forest. 
 
Following is a discussion of state and federal environmental and permitting issues as  well as 
social  and  community  issues  that  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  event  that  the  Hermosa 
advanced exploration project is progressed to the stage of mine development.  Appendix D lists 
the major permits required for mine construction. 
 
20.2  Federal Permits 
 
NEPA 
 
Requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) pose the greatest permitting 
challenges in terms of cost and length of time required.  NEPA review is required for any “major 
federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.” 
 
Much  of  the  land  surface  upon  which  the  project  would  be  built  is  public  land  under  the 
stewardship of the US Department of Agriculture, Coronado National Forest (CNF), and Sierra 
Vista  Ranger  District  (USFS).    The  USFS  will  most  likely  be  the  lead  agency  in  the  NEPA 
effort. 
 
Use  of  federal  lands  by  private  parties  is  governed  under  the  Federal  Land  Policy  and 
Management  Act  (FLPMA).    Regulations  under  FLPMA  will  require  that  Wildcat  obtain 
approval from CNF of a mine Plan of Operations (POO) for construction and operation of a mine

on  CNF  jurisdiction  land.    The  decision  to  approve  the  POO  is  a  “major  federal  action,” 
triggering NEPA. 
 
NEPA requires preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to support a decision to 
approve the POO. 
 
Preparation of the EIS is the responsibility of the CNF, not the mine developer.  CNF has neither 
the resources nor the technical capability to prepare an EIS in a timely manner.  So, in order to 
expedite the process, CNF may hire a third party contractor to prepare the EIS.  Wildcat would 
support this effort financially. 
 
The  EIS  process  requires  intensive  public  involvement  and  a  series  of  administrative  and 
technical  stages.    The  time  required  from  beginning  the  NEPA  process  to  issuance  of  a  final 
record of decision (ROD) could be two years or more.  Cost can exceed a million dollars. 
 
Clean Water Act (CWA) 
 
CWA permits are relatively routine and can be secured with little delay or cost. 
 
Corps  of  Engineers  (COE)  Section  404  Dredge  and  Fill  permits  should  also  be  reasonably 
straightforward and not particularly costly since the NEPA process has already been triggered by 
the POO approval requirement. 
 
Other federal permits amount to little more than notification and recordkeeping requirements. 
 
 
20.3  State of Arizona Permits 
 
Arizona’s  most  important  programs  for  mine  development  are  the  Aquifer  Protection  Permit 
(APP)  program  and  the  air  quality  permit  program.    Both  fall  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ).  Arizona’s mine reclamation program 
falls  under  the  State  Mine  Inspector’s  jurisdiction.    It  is  a  lesser,  but  still  important  permit 
program. 
 
Aquifer Protection Permits (APP) 
 
Apps  cover  practices  posing  a  hazard  to  ground  water  quality.    For  mine  operations,  affected 
facilities for mine operations would be tailings ponds, leach pads, process water ponds, landfills, 
and other surface impoundments. 
 
Air Quality 
 
Arizona  operates  the  air  quality  permit  program  under  jurisdiction  granted  by  EPA.    The 
complexity if the application and approval process depends upon the quantity of emissions.

20.4  Wilderness, Natural Areas and Other Special Status Lands 
 
The Miller Peak Wilderness in the southern Huachuca Mountains is about 18 miles east of the 
property.    Coronado  National  Monument  extends  from  this  Wilderness  south  to  the  Mexican 
border.  The Mount Wrightson Wilderness in the southern Santa Rita Mountains starts about 14 
miles north northeast.  These are in Hardshell’s viewshed.  The Sonoita Creek State Natural Area 
is adjacent to Patagonia Lake State Park; about 10 miles to the west of Hardshell.  Sonoita Creek 
near Patagonia is a bird-watching center.  The Patagonia-Sonoita Creek Preserve is owned by 
The Nature Conservancy.  It is approximately a mile from the town of Patagonia.  See attached 
map showing proximity to the wilderness areas. 
 
The Patagonia Mountains and Harshaw in particular are bird-watching and moth, butterfly and 
other insect collecting areas. 
 
The  Arizona  Trail  passes  about  four  miles  to  the  north  of  the  site.    This  should  not  pose  a 
significant obstacle to development. 
 
There is a State Park (or State Natural Area) on the Mexican border at the south end of the 
San Rafael de la Zanja (“SRZ”) land grant in the San Rafael Valley (“SRV”), approximately XX 
miles from the Hermosa property.  The park is 5 square miles in size.  The main SRZ land grant 
(approx.28  square  miles  in  size)  takes  up  much  of  S.  SRV,  which  is  now  owned  by  Nature 
Conservancy, who lease the ground out for well-supervised cattle grazing.  
 
The Bog Hole State Wildlife Area (200 acres) is 3 miles east of Harshaw, and contains bison 
fossils and is a favorite wildlife observation and hunting area for ducks (6 acre pond) and other 
birds.  This area is managed by Arizona Game and Fish (AZG&F) and there is deer and bird 
hunting in the area. 
 
The Empire Ranch/Cienegas (BLM) National Conservation Area is northeast of Sonoita and is 
not a major consideration. 
 
The distinctive brick (“Findley” – 1890) House in Harshaw is on the list of National Register of 
Historic  Places  and  once  was  the  main  office  of  the  Harshaw  Mining  Company  for  Hermosa 
operations.  Many of the buildings or parts of them at the Hale Ranch Headquarters date from the 
1880s to the early 20th century.

20.5  Environmental, Ecological and Archaeological Sensitivity 
 
Water Quality 
 
Surface water flows generally to Harshaw Creek and then to Sonoita Creek.  Sonoita Creek and 
Harshaw  Creek  support  bird-watching  in  the  riparian  habitat  between  Patagonia  and  Lake 
Patagonia.    The  flow  in  the  creek  segment  northwest  of  Patagonia  is  perennial  due  to  the 
discharge  from  the  Patagonia  sewer  treatment  plant.    No  surface  water  from  the  Hardshell 
Claims is in the SRV Drainage area except for the extreme southeast corner and should not be 
influenced by the project. 
 
Surface runoff in the southern reaches of the Hardshell property could flow to the San Rafael 
Valley and from there to the Santa Cruz River flowing into Mexico near Lochiel, Arizona. 
 
Surface water quality issues could pose an obstacle to mine development, but any issues  should 
be manageable with proper permitting.  Significant amounts of ground water are  in the Harshaw 
Creek drainage because of stream piracy from SRV Gravels.  Harshaw Creek, although draining 
into Sonoita Creek and Santa Cruz River, is not part of the Santa Cruz Active Management Area. 
 
The  Cienega  Creek  “drainage”  is  not  an  Arizona  Department  of  Water  Resources  Active 
Management Area. 
 
Ground  water  will  not  likely  constitute  a  major  issue  for  the  project.    The  geographic  setting 
would  indicate  there  is  little  potential  for  a  large  or  very  productive  aquifer.    Modern 
environmental  practice  and  state  regulations  will  encourage  and  require  lined  impoundments 
with leak protection systems. 
 
Ground water quality should not pose a major obstacle to mine development. 
 
 
Air Quality 
 
The area is designated as “attainment” for all ambient air quality standards.  Mines and mills 
typically can secure air quality construction and operating permits in attainment areas by using 
standard  emission  control  measures.    WSC  has  been  collecting  weather  data  for  future  Air 
Quality permits since August 2007. 
 
Air quality should not pose a major obstacle to mine development.

Solid and Hazardous Waste 
 
Most  mine  and  milling  wastes  are  exempt  from  regulation.    Beyond  that,  mines  and  mills 
typically  do  not  produce  enough  non-exempt  hazardous  waste  to  trigger  permit  requirements.  
Other solid waste permits are usually not troublesome. 
 
Waste management should not pose a major obstacle to mine development. 
 
Endangered, Threatened and Special Status Species 
 
A full endangered species evaluation is beyond the scope of this evaluation.  However, there is 
nothing outstanding or unique about the habitat at the site.  It is typical pinon/juniper/oak forest 
undistinguishable from thousands of acres of surrounding forestland. 
 
There are Mexican spotted owl nesting sites 1-2 miles west of Hardshell and elsewhere in the 
Patagonia Mountains.  The Harshaw Area is a bird-watching and moth/butterfly collection area.  
The area is also purported jaguar, and perhaps, ocelot habitat, as is most of Santa Cruz County. 
 
Endangered species issues should not pose a major obstacle to mine development. 
 
Cultural Resources 
 
A full archaeological evaluation is beyond the scope of this evaluation. 
 
The site visit revealed no obvious artifacts from past mining or populations.  However, there are 
likely to be some historic traces given the historic mining activity.  The Arizona State Historic 
Preservation Office (ASHPO) has been known to consider old mine roads eligible for historic 
designation. 
 
There were 2000 people in the area in the early 1880s, including several hundred who lived at 
the  operating  Hermosa  Mine  (mostly  on  the  Patented,  Hermosa,  Bluff  and  Salvador  claims).  
There are many cultural scatter sited on patented and unpatented land at Harshaw. 
 
Nevertheless, there is no reason cultural resource issues should pose a major obstacle to mine 
development. 
 
Visual Resources 
 
Mt. Hopkins, in the Santa Rita Mountains near the Mt. Wrightson Wilderness, is clearly visible 
from the old Hardshell mine site.  It is likely that mine development would be visible from the 
Mt.  Wrightson  Wilderness.    Likewise,  mine  operations  facilities  located  on  hilltops  will  be 
visible from the San Rafael Valley. 
 
There is no legal or regulatory reason that visibility issues might impede mine development. 
The Whipple observatory on Mt. Hopkins may be sensitive to excess lighting from the mine.

Community Acceptance 
 
Nogales, with a population of 20,878, is the Santa Cruz County seat on the international border 
and  is  the  nearest  town  with  more  than  10,000  inhabitants,    At  26  road  miles  away  from 
Hermosa,  it  is  easy  commuting  distance  from  the  property.    Nogales  would  very  likely  be 
supportive of the mine development and historically has provided numerous mine-workers, mine 
supplies and mining infrastructure for the region.  A rapidly-growing “suburb” of Nogales, Rio 
Rico,  is  immediately  north  of  Nogales,  with  a  population  of  around  10,000,  is  partially 
unincorporated but some has been annexed or soon will be, into the City of Nogales. 
 
Patagonia, with a population of 881, is the nearest town, six miles away.  Culturally, Patagonia 
has historically been a mining, ranching and railroad community.  The mining and railroad are 
gone  and  ranching  is  greatly  diminished.    Recently,  the  town  has  attracted  more  artists  and 
upscale,  well-educated  retires  and  professional/technical  personnel  who  commute  to  work 
elsewhere.    Many  local  businesses  partially  cater  to  the  tourist  and  outdoor  sporting  industry.  
Several upscale  gated subdivisions have sprouted up in the past few  years.  Others are barely 
developed or in financial trouble. 
 
While  the  long-term  residents  and  some  business-owners  would  likely  support  mine 
development as a source of jobs and economic stimulus, the newer arrivals may be resistant to 
mine development in the immediate area.  Fortunately, the mine is not immediately adjacent to 
the  town  or  the  subdivisions.    Many  of  the  town  residents,  their  parents  and  older  relatives 
worked for ASARCO at the Trench Unit, 1-2 miles NW of Hardshell or other mining operations 
in the Patagonia Mountains from before the 1930s into the 1960s.  Nevertheless, the prospect of 
increased  traffic,  population  growth  and  other  socioeconomic  effects  could  arouse  resistance. 
Wildcat  Silver  has  made  some  initial  outreach  contacts  with  the  Patagonia  Area  business

Sonoita,  with  a  population  of  826,  was  historically  a  cattle  ranching  town.    In  recent  years 
Sonoita  has  become  an  upscale  residential  center  for  horse-lovers.    12  miles  northeast  of 
Patagonia, it is within reasonable commuting distance of Tucson.  It is also a center of Arizona’s 
nascent wine industry.

21.0  Capital and Operating Costs 
 
A  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment  (PEA)  of  the  Hermosa  Project  was  prepared  in  October 
2010  titled  “Hardshell  Project  –  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment,  Santa  Cruz  County, 
Arizona”.  This study was a combined open pit and underground operations at a combined rate of 
4,000 tons per day for approximately 18 years of production.  A summary of the initial capital 
costs from the October 2010 PEA is included as Table 21-1 and the operating costs are shown on 
Table 21-2.  The mineral resource has  grown significantly  since the development of the PEA 
plus a new mineralization zone (the Upper Silver Zone) has been partially delineated, thus the 
October 2010 PEA is not relevant to the potential size of the currently proposed project, but is 
referenced here as previous work.

22.0  Economic Analysis 
 
The economic analysis presented in the October 2010 PEA on the 4,000 tpd material processing 
rate showed an IRR of 19% at the time of its evaluation.  This is summarized on Table 22-1.  As 
mentioned previously, the size of the project developed for the October 2010 PEA is too small 
when compared to the currently defined mineral resource.  An updated PEA will need to be done 
to evaluate the project at a larger scale, thus the summary of the economic evaluation is shown 
here for reference only.

23.0 Adjacent Properties
23-1
Currently  there  are  no  significant  operating  mines  in  the  Harshaw  or  nearby  mining  districts. 
Properties  adjacent  to  Hermosa  have  had  limited  or  no  recent  exploration.  The  mineralization 
discussed  on  adjacent  properties  is  hosted  by  various  types  of  deposits  that  are  not  directly 
related to WSC’s Hermosa deposit, nor a projection of the Hermosa deposit, and this information 
is not intended to indicate that such mineralization might be present on the Hermosa property. 
 
ASARCO LLC’s: Trench Property The Trench mine produced silver, lead, and zinc from a vein 
system discontinuously between 1760 and 1949, with a custom mill that operated between 1938 
and  1964.  The  last  exploration  in  the  area  was  conducted  in  1979-1989.  The  mine  and  mill 
complex (~300 acres) included four tailings ponds, all of which were reclaimed by ASARCO 
between 1989-1994. The property has been transferred to the ASARCO Custodial Trust. 
 
Bronco Creek Exploration: This group holds a small block of unpatented (PAT) claims located 
on the western margin of Hermosa property. There is no known exploration activity. 
 
White Cloud Resources: Large Block of unpatented (WCR) claims west and south of Hermosa 
property. Recent activity by a joint venture partner, Oz Minerals Inc. includes permitting with 
the USFS to drill targets on the unpatented claim block.  
 
Mowry  Group  Patented  Claims:  The  Mowry  holdings  are  essentially  contiguous  to  WSC’s 
claims to the south of the Hermosa property.  The holdings consist of approximately 290 acres of 
patented  claims.  These  workings  produced  oxidized  silver,  lead  and  manganese  oxides  from 
replacements in Paleozoic limestones along a strong east-northeast fault zone from the 1700s to 
1952. This patented ground was traded to the US Government in 1992-94 with the USFS now 
administering the surface. The mineral rights (BLM administered) to these patented claims were 
also  included  in  the  trade  and  the  ground  is  not  open  to  mineral  entry  as  they  are  “Acquired 
Lands.”

25.0  Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
The  interpretation  and  conclusion  of  the  author  is  that  the  current  mineral  resource  is  as 
presented in Table 25-1 and in the Wildcat press release dated February 6, 2012.  The mineral 
resource  is  based  on  216  drill  holes  with  150,702  feet  of  core,  reverse  circulation  and  rotary 
drilling.  The information provided by Wildcat is a composite of data collected by Wildcat and 
previous owners who supplied earlier data to Wildcat.  The drill hole data has been reviewed by 
an  independent  person,  Lynda  Bloom,  who  found  no  issues  with  the  data  available  for  the 
mineral resource estimate.  The title to the mineral claims (patented and unpatented) has been 
verified by John C. Lacy, attorney-at-law of the firm DeConcini, McDonald, Yetwin & Lacy, 
PC.  IMC has found no reason to question the data provided for the preparation of the mineral 
resource statement.

The  author  has  reviewed  the  October  2010  PEA  titled  “Hardshell  Project  –  Preliminary 
Economic Assessment – Santa Cruz County, Arizona’, dated 26 October 2010.  This PEA was 
based on a smaller resource and developed a project of 4,000 tpd material to be processed.  The 
material rate is small relative to the current resource and a new zone of mineralization (Upper 
Silver Zone) has been defined since the October 2010 PEA.  It is the author’s conclusion that the 
PEA  should  be  updated  with  the  new  resource  and  metallurgical  information  along  with 
continued definition and step out drilling to complete the delineation of the mineral resource.

26.0  Recommendations 
 
IMC makes the following recommendations regarding future work for the Hermosa Project.
•  Complete the current drill program on the patented claims, expected completion in April
26-1
2011.
•  Update the mineral resource estimate based on the drilling completed between September
•  Begin the permitting process for a drill program on the US Forest Service (USFS)
15, 2011 and end of April 2012.
unpatented claims.
•  Begin environmental background and monitoring programs. 
•  Continue metallurgical test programs for both the Manto and Upper Silver Zones. 
•  Do some additional drilling in the Manto Zone and Upper Silver Zone to improve the
classification confidence (indicated to measured).
•  Follow up with Lynda Bloom’s recommendation to evaluate lab proceedures.
Wildcat has a budget of US$12 million to drill 180,000 feet during late 2012 through 2013 on the 
unpatented claims.  This drilling will test new targets and expand the Upper Silver Zone mineral 
resource.  This work will depend on receiving drill permits from the USFS. 
 
Once the mineral resource is updated with drill data from the soon to be completed mineral 
resource, an updated evaluation of the project should be done which will potentially lead to an 
updated PEA or prefeasibility study.
