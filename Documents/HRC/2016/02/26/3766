<p> 
</p>
<p><b>General Assembly </b>Distr.: General 
13 October 2011 
 
Original: English<b> </b></p>


<p><b> </b><i>Underlining </i>the importance of the ratification of all relevant international 
conventions against terrorism, especially the International Convention for the Suppression 
of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention against the Taking of 
Hostages, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>in particular</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are 
the interrelated pillars of the United Nations system, and renewing its commitment to 
strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism,  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Reaffirming </i>that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and the rule of 
law are essential to the fight against terrorism, and recognizing that effective counter-
terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals but are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing,  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Expressing concern </i>at the increase in incidents of kidnapping and hostage-taking by 
terrorists and their negative impact on the realization and the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing</i> <i>in mind</i> that the Security Council, in its resolution 1963 (2010), noted with 
concern that terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security, 
the enjoyment of human rights and the social and economic development of all Member 
States, and undermines global stability and prosperity, that this threat has become more 
diffuse, with an increase, in various regions of the world, of terrorist acts, and recognized 
that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually 
reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to reflect on the question of human rights and issues 
related to terrorist hostage-taking;  
</p>
<p> 2.<b> </b><i>Notes with appreciation</i> the holding of a panel discussion on the issue of 
human rights in the context of action taken to address terrorist hostage-taking by the 
Human Rights Council at its sixteenth session;  
</p>
<p> 3.<b> </b><i>Takes note</i> of the summary of the panel&#8217;s deliberations prepared by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights;1 
</p>
<p>4.  <i>Reaffirms</i> that all acts of terrorism, including acts of hostage-taking, 
wherever and by whomever they are committed, are serious crimes aimed at the destruction 
of human rights and are, under all circumstances, unjustifiable;<b> </b></p>
<p> 5.<b> </b><i>Recognizes</i> that the issue of hostage-taking by terrorist groups poses a 
number of challenges and has an adverse impact not only on the protection of the human 
rights of hostages but also on the protection and enjoyment of these rights by those living in 
local communities, including in terms of socio-economic impact and development, in the 
countries of the regions affected by this scourge, and expresses concern at the fact that 
actions or measures taken to obtain the release of hostages may compound this adverse 
impact; 
</p>
<p> 6. <b> </b><i>Requests</i> the Advisory Committee to prepare a study on the issue described in 
paragraph<b> </b>5 above<b> </b>for the purposes of promoting awareness and understanding, paying 
particular attention to its impact on human rights and the role of regional and international 
cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 7.<b> </b><i>Encourages</i> the Advisory Committee, when elaborating the above-mentioned 
study, to take into account, as appropriate, and to refrain from duplicating<b> </b>the work done on 
the issue by competent United Nations bodies and mechanisms, and therefore to adhere 
</p>

<p>strictly to the provisions contained in General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human 
Rights Council resolution 5/1;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 8.<b> </b><i>Requests</i> the Advisory Committee to submit the study to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-third session and to present an interim report thereon at its twenty-first 
session. 
</p>
<p><i>36th meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i>29 September 2011

<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
