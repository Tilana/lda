<p> <i>Summary</i> 
The present report is a response to Human Rights Council resolution 12/28 entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow-up to the tenth special session of the Human Rights Council on the impact of the 
global economic and financial crises on the universal realization and effective enjoyment of 
human rights&#8221;, in which the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;consult Member States of the United Nations and all 
other relevant stakeholders on the issue with a view to presenting to the Council at its 
thirteenth session a report on the impact of the crises on the realization of all human rights 
and on possible actions required to alleviate it&#8221;. Accordingly, the report draws from 
contributions received from Member States and other relevant stakeholders in response to 
the above resolution, as well as from outcomes of major events, including the United 
Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on 
Development held in New York in June 2009. 
</p>
<p>The report highlights potential human rights issues raised in these deliberations, reports 
and contributions. They indicate that, while it is still too early to assess the full impact of 
the crisis &#8212; as some of its longer-term effects continue to affect different countries and 
regions in varying degrees &#8212; it is clear that the global crisis has the potential to reverse or 
slow down the progress made so far towards achieving the internationally agreed 
development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. The report also notes 
that, while recent economic forecasts suggest that the crisis may be tapering off, it will take 
some time before its longer-term impact on individuals and their human rights is fully 
known. A number of potential impacts were raised in various deliberations, reports and 
conferences, such as an increase in global poverty or unemployment; a possible decrease in

<p>social spending resulting in more limited access to health care, education, housing and 
other social programmes; and a deterioration of the situation of some marginalized groups. 
Furthermore, the report notes several actions, initiatives and proposals put forward to 
address the impact of the crisis on human rights, as highlighted in contributions, reports and 
analyses made by Member States, treaty bodies, special procedures mandate holders, the 
United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders. The report concludes by noting the 
importance of continuing to monitor the impact of the crisis on human rights in order to 
guide national and international efforts to ensure respect for and protection of all human 
rights of those who are affected by the crisis.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/28 
entitled &#8220;Follow-up to the tenth special session of the Human Rights Council on the impact 
of the global economic and financial crises on the universal realization and effective 
enjoyment of human rights&#8221;, in which the Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to &#8220;consult Member States of the 
United Nations and all other relevant stakeholders on the issue with a view to presenting to 
the Council at its thirteenth session a report on the impact of the crises on the realization of 
all human rights and on possible actions required to alleviate it&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. Accordingly, Member States and other relevant stakeholders were invited to submit 
information in response to the above resolution. At the time of submission of this report, 
written inputs had been received from the Governments of Afghanistan, Cuba, Colombia, 
Greece, Morocco, Serbia, Switzerland and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) as well as 
from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the World Health Organization and the 
International Network for Economic, Social &amp; Cultural Rights. In addition, this report also 
draws on publicly available documents from relevant stakeholders and other consultation 
processes and deliberations under the Council and the General Assembly, such as the tenth 
special session of the Human Rights Council on the impact of the global economic and 
financial crisis on the universal realization and effective enjoyment of human rights, held in 
Geneva on 20 February 2009; the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and 
Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development held in New York in June 2009; and the 
2009 Social Forum of the Human Rights Council, held in Geneva from 31 August to 2 
September 2009. All written submissions received for the preparation of this report are 
available for consultation in the files of the secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of the global financial and economic crisis 
</b>3. Over the last few years, the world economy has experienced one of the most severe 
financial and economic crises since the Second World War. Beginning with the collapse of 
the housing market in the United States of America in 2007, the crisis spread rapidly from 
the financial markets of developed countries to large parts of the global economy. 
Collapsing world trade and commodity prices were quickly translated into losses in 
employment and income, affecting the real economies both in developed and developing 
countries. The General Assembly noted that, &#8220;The origins and causes of the crisis are 
complex and multifaceted, but it is widely recognized that many of the main causes of the 
crisis are linked to systemic fragilities and imbalances that contributed to the inadequate 
functioning of the global economy.&#8221;1 
</p>
<p>4. Contributions to the present report received from Member States, as well as 
available data and analyses, suggest that the impact of the crisis has not been uniform, 
differing across countries and regions. For example, World Bank and United Nations 
analyses suggest that Europe and Central Asia were among the most affected regions, 
whereas the recovery was relatively swift in East Asia and the Pacific region.2 At the same 
time, in many of the poorest countries which lack the capacity and resources to undertake

</b></p>
<p>necessary countermeasures, there is a fear that the crisis has the potential to significantly 
slow down progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>5. There has been an unprecedented policy response to the crisis, including monetary, 
financial and fiscal measures to stabilize financial markets and revive global growth. 
According to the latest economic forecasts available at the time of the submission of this 
report, these countermeasures and stimulus packages have contributed to slowing down the 
pace of the economic downturn, giving way to a slow and fragile recovery.3 At the same 
time, these forecasts and various reports caution that the trend towards recovery remains 
weak. While the global economy will require continued stimulus until it sees a more 
vigorous sign of recovery, there are already signs that the stimulus measures in place are 
draining the financial reserves of many countries, increasing deficit levels across the board, 
which could further contribute to financial instability.4 Furthermore, it should be noted that 
it will take some time until the full impact of the crisis is known, including in many of the 
poorest countries. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The impact of the financial crisis on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overall implications for human rights 
</b></p>
<p>6. Since its outbreak, the crisis has prompted concerns about the impact on individuals 
and their human rights in both developed and developing countries, especially those who 
are already living in extreme poverty, marginalization, discrimination and fear. The crisis 
and its effect on such issues as employment, poverty, access to basic services and social 
protection have a bearing on the ability of individuals to exercise their human rights and 
that of States to fulfil their obligations. These concerns were reiterated at the tenth special 
session of the Human Rights Council and its ensuing resolution S-10/1, in which the 
Council expressed &#8220;serious concern at the negative impacts of the global economic and 
financial crises on economic and social development and on the full enjoyment of all 
human rights in all countries&#8221;, as well as at the 2009 Social Forum held in September 2009. 
Concerns about the human rights implications of the crisis have also been highlighted in 
numerous reports and analyses issued by United Nations agencies, treaty bodies, special 
procedures mandate holders and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>7. Contributions from Member States and other stakeholders generally reflect these 
concerns, as well as the varying levels of real and potential impact of the crisis across 
countries and regions. The Government of Afghanistan reported that, since the country has 
no financial markets, the impact of the global economic crisis on its economy is low. A 
decrease in foreign aid due to the crisis, as well as a forecast fall in revenues would, 
however, affect Afghanistan. In its submission, the Government of Cuba stated that the 
crisis was triggered by deregulation of the financial sector and has, in particular, affected 
economic, social and cultural rights. The Government of Greece reported on rising 
unemployment rates from May 2008 until August 2009 as a consequence of the economic 
crisis. The Government of Morocco reported that, despite fears of a severe economic 
downturn in several sectors, the impact has been relatively moderate. The contributions

</p>

 Latest estimates by the International Monetary Fund show that the deficits of the advanced countries 
</p>
<p>averaged 1.9 per cent of national income before the financial crisis started in 2007. This year they are 
expected to reach 9.7 per cent, followed by 8.7 per cent in 2010. Emerging economies with their 
faster economic growth and greater constraints on borrowing expect much lower build-up of debt. </p>

</p>
<p>from the Government of Morocco as well as from the International Network for Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights emphasized that migrants also face increased discrimination and 
xenophobia in addition to unemployment. The Government of Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of) indicated that the crisis has had an impact on articles 13, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25 and 
26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Generally, the crisis and the global economic slowdown associated with it, has the 
potential to impact on human rights directly and indirectly, including on the ability of 
individuals to exercise and claim their rights and on the ability of States to fulfil their 
obligations. The World Bank has estimated that 89 million more people could be pushed 
below the poverty line of US$ 1.25 a day by the end of 2010,5 and many other reports have 
also pointed to the potential of the crisis for slowing down progress towards the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed 
development goals, which are important milestones and benchmarks for the realization of 
human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. While poverty exists in both 
developed and developing countries, many of the poorest countries lack the necessary 
means to protect their people from exogenous shocks, while at the same time facing 
difficulties in mobilizing additional resources. 
</p>
<p>9. The reports have also raised the increase in unemployment as an issue of major 
concern. The International Labour Organization (ILO) stated that unless adequate measures 
are adopted and in some cases continued, more than 40 million people could drop out of the 
labour market.6 In its &#8220;World of Work Report 2009: The Global Jobs Crisis and Beyond&#8221;, 
the ILO indicated that &#8220;employment in high GDP per-capita countries may not return to 
pre-crisis levels before 2013. In emerging and developing countries, employment levels 
could start recovering from 2010.&#8221;7 The report also indicated that, based on experience 
from earlier crises, the risk of unemployment is especially acute for low-skilled and older 
workers. 
</p>
<p>10. Longer-term effects, such as unemployment and an increase in poverty, can directly 
affect the ability of a country to levy taxes. This can result in decreased budgetary 
resources, endangering social spending and the progressive realization of a number of 
economic and social rights. The independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, has stated that &#8220;countries which are 
already struggling to fulfil their basic human rights obligations will face increasingly 
difficult obstacles as national funds grow scarce, and conditions for contracting loans grow 
increasingly stringent&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>11. The impact of the crisis on economic, social and cultural rights has been highlighted 
by the Human Rights Council special procedures mandate holders and United Nations 
agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated in 
its 2009 report, entitled &#8220;The State of Food Insecurity in the World: Economic crises &#8211;

<p>impacts and lessons learned&#8221; that more than a billion people were undernourished in 2009 
and even before the crisis, hunger was on the rise.9 In the meantime, as needs increase, the 
ability of aid agencies to respond is being limited by the global economic downturn. In his 
report to the Council in July 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food noted that the 
global food crisis has not unfolded in isolation from the global financial and economic 
crisis, with the consequence that many developing countries might face increasing 
difficulty in financing agriculture and rural development, subsidizing food to improve its 
affordability for the poorest, and establishing or strengthening social protection 
programmes.10 
</p>
<p>12. In her report submitted to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council, the 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, pointed out that 
the crisis has worsened affordability problems for housing and land across the world.11 The 
Special Rapporteur also stated that the crisis and its origins in the housing market reflect 
fundamental flaws in economic and housing policies, revealing the inability of market 
mechanisms to provide adequate and affordable housing for all. She further noted that these 
economic, financial and housing policies and approaches that have seriously impacted the 
right to adequate housing in the past decades have contributed to the present crisis. 
</p>
<p>13. In developed as well as developing countries the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights, such as the right to health and the right to education, are particularly 
vulnerable to budget cuts. The World Bank has estimated that the 43 countries which were 
still in recession at the beginning of December 2009 face a US$ 11.6 billion shortfall in 
core spending for health and education.12 The World Health Organization has estimated that 
one billion people faced difficulties in accessing quality basic health services even before 
the crisis. This large number might increase due to the lack of available funds. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Rights of women and children 
</b></p>
<p>14. The crisis and the economic and social distress caused by it tend to 
disproportionately affect women and children, especially young girls. The Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, in its statement issued on 6 February 
2009, expressed its concern that, while the scale of the crisis was still largely unmeasured, 
women and girls in both developed and developing countries would be particularly affected 
by the potential social and economic consequences, such as unemployment, increase of 
responsibilities both at work and at home, decrease of income and potential increase in 
societal and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, in her statement issued on 
International Women&#8217;s Day (9 March 2009), pointed out that violence against women 
intensifies when men experience displacement and dispossession related to economic crisis. 
Referring to analyses by ILO and others, in her report submitted to the eleventh session of 
the Human Rights Council, she emphasized that the impact of the economic crisis is 
expected to be more detrimental to women&#8217;s employment than to that of men in most 
regions of the world, and that women migrant and domestic workers have already been

</p>
<p>among the first to be laid off.13 Such worrisome signs are likely to result in serious setbacks 
to the realization of gender equality and the elimination of violence against women. The 
Special Rapporteur further highlighted the experience from past crises, for example the 
impact of the Asian financial crisis (1997&#8211;1998) on women and girls which in some 
countries strained intra-household relationships, boosted suicides, domestic violence and 
abandonment, and provoked a private and public backlash against women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>16. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) noted that the full impact on 
children is yet to be felt. In previous financial and economic crises, child mortality has risen 
and school enrolment dropped, and there are already indications that this crisis &#8212; 
compounded by recent food and fuel price instability &#8212; is causing increases in poverty and 
malnutrition. Furthermore, many impacts of the crisis in developing countries, such as 
slowing growth, reduced demand and employment, and declining budgets are only now 
beginning to unfold, severely threatening progress on health, education and child 
protection, and leaving children with the long-term mental and physical repercussions of 
malnutrition. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>17. In addition to the impact of the crisis on remittance flow, several human rights 
experts expressed concerns about the increased vulnerability of migrants, migrant workers 
and their families, as a result of the crisis and economic downturn. In his report to the 
eleventh session of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
of migrants highlighted the fact that child migration, as well as adult migration, is 
influenced by new global phenomena such as climate change, the food crisis and the 
financial and economic crisis.14 The independent expert on the question of human rights 
and extreme poverty also indicated in her report to the sixty-fourth session of the General 
Assembly that, in times of recession, the lack of work opportunities and increased 
discrimination and xenophobia deeply affect migrants&#8217; enjoyment of their human rights.15 
</p>
<p><b> IV. United Nations response to the crisis 
</b></p>
<p>18. At the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and 
Its Impact on Development in June 2009, world leaders pledged their commitment to 
continue to work in solidarity on a vigorous, coordinated and comprehensive global 
response to the crisis, in accordance with their respective abilities and responsibilities. 
Proclaiming that &#8220;we are all in this crisis together&#8221;, they pledged to combine their short-
term responses to meet the immediate impact of the financial and economic crisis, 
particularly on the most vulnerable countries, with medium- and long-term responses that 
necessarily involve the pursuit of development and the review of the global economic 
system. They also requested the Economic and Social Council to coordinate system-wide 
follow-up to the recommendations in the outcome document, and consider setting up an ad 
hoc panel of experts on the crisis and its impact on development. In the annex to General 
Assembly resolution 63/303 on the outcome of the Conference, the Heads of State and 
Government stressed that developing countries had not caused the crisis, but were 
nevertheless being affected by it, and stated that their endeavours must be guided by the 
need to address the human costs: an increase in the already unacceptable number of poor

<p>and vulnerable, particularly women and children, who suffer and die of hunger, 
malnutrition and preventable or curable disease; a rise in unemployment; the reduction in 
access to education and health services; and the current inadequacy of social protection in 
many countries. 
</p>
<p>19. As recommended by the Human Rights Council, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights participated in the Conference and called on all 
stakeholders to prioritize human rights in formulating responses to the crisis. Several 
special procedures mandate holders issued statements and briefings at the time of the 
Conference to highlight the impact of the crisis on human rights relevant to their mandates. 
The Special Rapporteur on the right to food emphasized that, in spite of the current 
economic meltdown, the continuing global crisis in food prices should not be forgotten and 
called for greater attention to be paid to the right to food framework. The independent 
expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty appealed in a briefing note to 
the Conference to ensure the right to social security for all people at all times by 
establishing or strengthening social protection systems, and the independent expert on the 
effects of foreign debt and other related financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment 
of human rights made a statement on the difficulties ahead for countries already struggling 
to meet their human rights obligations and now facing increasingly stringent loan contract 
conditions (see paragraph 10 above). 
</p><p>20. In the annex to resolution 63/303 on the outcome of the Conference, Member States 
also supported further development of the comprehensive crisis response of the United 
Nations development system in support of national development strategies, through a 
coordinated approach by United Nations funds and programmes, specialized agencies and 
the international financial institutions at the country level.16 The United Nations system has 
been promoting such a coordinated approach through the United Nations System Chief 
Executives Board for Coordination (CEB). In its communiqu&#233; of April 2009 the CEB stated 
that, &#8220;In the face of this unfolding crisis, the multilateral system must deploy all its 
resources and capacities in a rapid and effective response, while upholding the principles, 
values and goals to which the international community has committed. Open economies 
and societies must be defended to avoid the risk of reverting to inward-looking policies, 
protectionism and even xenophobia. Human rights, democracy, social justice and peace 
must be preserved.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>21. The CEB then developed a package of nine joint initiatives consisting of: 
 (a) Additional financing for the most vulnerable through advocating and 
devising a joint World Bank-United Nations system mechanism for the common 
articulation and implementation of additional financing, including through a proposed 
vulnerability fund under the World Bank; 
</p>
<p> (b) Improved food security through strengthening programmes to feed the 
hungry and expanding support to farmers in developing countries; 
</p>
<p> (c) Fighting protectionism, including through the conclusion of the Doha round 
and strengthening aid for trade initiatives and finance for trade; 
</p>
<p> (d) A green economy initiative for promoting investment in long-term 
environmental sustainability and putting the world on a climate-friendly path; 
</p>
<p> (e) A global jobs pact for boosting employment, production, investment and 
aggregate demand, and promoting decent work for all;

<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 Para. 52 (b). </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10930 
</p>
<p> (f) A social protection floor for ensuring access to basic social services, shelter, 
and empowerment, and protection of the poor and vulnerable; 
</p>
<p> (g) Humanitarian, security and social stability, including emergency action to 
protect lives and livelihoods, meeting hunger and humanitarian needs, protecting displaced 
people and shoring up security and social stability; 
</p>
<p> (h) Technology and innovation &#8211; developing technological infrastructure to 
facilitate the promotion of and access to innovation; 
</p>
<p> (i) Monitoring and analysis to strengthen macroeconomic and financial 
surveillance and implementing an effective economic early warning system, as well as 
establishing a United Nations system-wide vulnerability monitoring and alert mechanism to 
track developments and report on the political, economic, social and environmental 
dimensions of the crisis. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR contributes to several of these joint initiatives in order to integrate human rights 
perspectives in global responses by the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Possible actions to alleviate the impact of the crisis 
</b></p>
<p>22. Addressing the impact of the crisis on the realization of human rights requires 
concerted efforts both at national and international levels. The Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution S-10/1, called upon States to note that the global economic and financial crises 
do not diminish the responsibility of national authorities in the realization of human rights 
and urged the international community to support national efforts to protect the most 
vulnerable segments of their societies. 
</p>
<p>23. Reflecting the above-mentioned Council resolution, several Member States provided 
information in their contributions to the present report on relevant actions undertaken by 
governments to counteract the impact of the financial crisis and to protect the rights of 
those severely affected by it. This section highlights several examples of such actions taken 
by States as well as those recommendations and proposals made by the United Nations 
human rights mechanisms and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Protection of the most vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p>24. As called for by the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis, a 
number of governments reported on their efforts to coordinate national responses and to 
protect or mobilize resources for social protection, food security and other basic services 
for the most vulnerable population affected by the crisis. For example, the Government of 
Colombia reported that it has adopted a five-pronged strategy in response to the crisis, 
including strengthening social assistance to the most vulnerable sections of the population. 
Similarly, the Government of Greece reported that a number of measures had been adopted 
to balance the effects of the crisis on the most vulnerable population groups. The 
Government of Morocco established a coordinating body (<i>Comit&#233; de veille strat&#233;gique</i>) 
presided over by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to deal with the effects of the crisis. 
The Government of Serbia reported that it had reacted in a timely manner to the emergence 
of the global economic crisis including through the adoption of an Economic Stability Plan 
on 9 April 2009, with a view to mitigating the adverse effects of the crisis and ensuring the 
social security of citizens. </p>

<p>25. According to the ILO, 80 per cent of the global population had less than adequate 
social protection coverage even before the crisis.17 The need to establish or strengthen a 
social protection floor has been emphasized in the CEB joint initiatives, including the 
Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference, as well as in the 
Ministerial Declaration of the Economic and Social Council. Several special procedures 
mandate holders have been advocating that such initiatives should be grounded in national 
and international human rights frameworks so that they effectively contribute to the 
protection of the human rights of the poor, the most vulnerable and those who are 
discriminated against. The importance of social security as a tool for the protection of the 
basic human rights of all persons was also highlighted at the second meeting of the Social 
Forum of the Human Rights Council held from 31 August to 2 September 2009 in Geneva 
which brought together a wide range of stakeholders concerned with the negative impact of 
the economic and financial crisis on efforts to combat poverty. The Social Forum 
recommended, inter alia, that States need to take all necessary measures to provide social 
security coverage to all, particularly to the most vulnerable, and highlighted that civil 
society played an important role in raising awareness and advocating more inclusive social 
security systems. 
</p>
<p>26. Recognizing that migrants are among the most vulnerable in the context of the crisis, 
the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis highlighted the need to resist 
unfair and discriminatory treatment of migrant workers and the imposition of unreasonable 
restrictions on labour migration in order to maximize the benefits of international 
migration, while complying with the relevant national legislation and applicable 
international instruments. Efforts to raise awareness of the human rights of migrants and 
their positive contribution to development both in host countries and their countries of 
origin are important elements of such efforts. Anti-migrant sentiments and discriminatory 
practices are not only a human rights concern but also obstacles to the inclusion, acceptance 
and integration of migrants in host countries. Conversely, human rights-based regulations 
and policies which promote access to decent work, health care, education and adequate 
housing are important not only for the protection of the human rights of migrants, but also 
for their social inclusion and integration. In addition, regular labour migration channels 
should remain open with a view to meeting a continuing demand for migrant workers, thus 
helping to prevent irregular migration and trafficking and to reduce the vulnerability of 
migrants to exploitative employment outside the regular labour market. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>27. While national initiatives were at the core of the measures taken to address the crisis, 
international cooperation was also required in view of the global nature of the crisis. At the 
Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis in June 2009, world leaders 
pledged their commitment to continue to work in solidarity on a vigorous, coordinated and 
comprehensive global response to the crisis, in accordance with their respective abilities 
and responsibilities (see paragraph 18 above). 
</p><p>28. At the 2009 Social Forum, participants recalled that international assistance and 
cooperation is enshrined in, inter alia, article 2 (1) of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that there is a duty to assist countries that do not 
have the domestic resources to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights 
recognized in the Covenant. It was reaffirmed that human rights principles and obligations

<p>had established the foundation for effective international assistance and cooperation. The 
Social Forum further recognized that international assistance and cooperation played a 
significant role in making social security viable for all States, and urged donor States to 
fulfil their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, for which they should 
have mechanisms in place to ensure the efficient and objective use of ODA. 
</p><p>29. The need for further reform of the decision-making process on international 
economic policy was another area of international cooperation highlighted in several 
contributions from Member States and other stakeholders from civil society. As underlined 
by the Council in its resolution S-10/1, they pointed to the need to establish an equitable, 
transparent and democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation 
of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Responsibility of non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>30. The global economic and financial crisis brought a renewed focus on the role and 
responsibilities of non-State actors along with those of States. In its contribution to the 
present report, the Government of Switzerland emphasized that it encouraged the private 
sector to contribute to sustainable development in a manner respecting human rights. In this 
context, the Government reported that it has actively promoted the United Nations Global 
Compact and reaffirmed the importance of the ten principles that underline this initiative. 
</p>
<p>31. In his report to the eleventh session of the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises maintained that while markets can be highly efficient means for 
allocating scarce resources and powerful forces for promoting social objectives ranging 
from poverty alleviation to the rule of law, they must have adequate institutional 
underpinnings and be embedded in the broader values of social community. He stressed 
that these governance gaps create the permissive environment within which blameworthy 
acts by corporations may occur without adequate sanctions or reparation. He recommended 
that governments must avoid erecting protectionist barriers or lowering human rights 
standards for businesses; their short-run gains are illusory and they undermine longer-term 
recovery. For companies, even downsizing and plant closings must be conducted 
responsibly, and restoring public trust and confidence in business is as much of an 
immediate challenge as reinventing viable business models.18 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion 
</b>32. <b>At the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis 
and Its Impact on Development in June 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights stated that this crisis was not only a crisis of development, but of 
human rights as well. Throughout the crisis the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms have stressed the importance of putting individuals and their human 
rights at the centre of considerations in responding to the crisis, and the value of 
human rights principles and international standards in guiding and strengthening 
national and international policies and responses to the crisis. Public participation, 
transparency, access to information, judicial protection and accountability serve as 
important building blocks ensuring sustainable recovery and growth in a manner that 
minimizes the impact on human rights and further contributes to their realization.

<p>33. <b>This report notes a range of implications that the crisis has had or can have for 
the effective enjoyment of human rights, as well as commitments and actions 
undertaken to address the impact of the crisis. At the same time, because of its global 
and multi-faceted nature, it is expected that some of the impacts of the crisis will 
continue to emerge in a gradual and differentiated manner. There is a need to 
continue to pay attention to the impact of the longer-term effects of the crisis on 
human rights and to monitor the impact of national and international efforts, in order 
to ensure respect for and protection of all human rights of those who are affected by 
the crisis.
