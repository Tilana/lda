<p><b>I.  Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the first to be submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the Human 
Rights Council since the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea completed its work in March 2014.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 22/13, the Human Rights Council decided to establish the 
commission of inquiry for a period of one year to investigate the systematic, widespread 
and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. It also 
extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for a period of one year, and designated 
him to be one of the three commissioners. The commission presented its final report to the 
Council at its twenty-fifth session.1 The Special Rapporteur, in a note,2 informed the 
Council that he would submit his regular report to the Council at its twenty-sixth session in 
order to take into account the follow-up and subsequent developments after the commission 
had completed its mandate. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur prepared the present report in the wake of resolution 25/25 
on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea adopted by 
an overwhelming majority by the Human Rights Council on 28 March 2014. In the 
resolution, adopted by a recorded vote of 30 in favour, 6 against and 11 abstentions, the 
Council called upon all parties concerned, including United Nations bodies, to consider 
implementation of the recommendations made by the commission of inquiry in its report in 
order to address the dire human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. It also requested the Special Rapporteur to submit regular reports to the Human 
Rights Council and to the General Assembly on the implementation of his mandate, 
including on the follow-up efforts made in the implementation of the recommendations of 
the commission of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur shares his initial thoughts about the 
direction he intends to take in fulfilling his mandate, building on the findings and 
recommendations of the commission of inquiry. In this sense, the report is not a regular 
update of the situation of human rights as such, but rather indicates the way forward. The 
Special Rapporteur firmly believes that the work of the commission has turned a page in 
decades-long efforts to address the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, and provided a unique opportunity for the international community to 
help to make a difference in the lives of its people, including the victims aboard. There is 
no turning back; it cannot be &#8220;business as usual&#8221; as the international community presses on 
to ease the ongoing suffering of the people and to ensure accountability, justice and 
reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur believes that any discussion about the report submitted by 
the commission of inquiry would be incomplete without paying tribute to the victims who 
have survived and courageously spoken up about unspeakable atrocities, and bearing in 
mind those who are still suffering, and the beleaguered population of 20 million who may 
still fall victim to the widespread human rights violations that affect every aspect of daily 
life in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In many ways, the commission&#8217;s report 
was a report of the victims and their courage to bear witness, to give voice to those who 
have perished or have not been able to tell their story.

  A/HRC/25/62.  </p>


<p><b> II. A new phase of work 
</b></p>
<p>6. The work performed by the commission of inquiry should be seen as the beginning 
of a process, not the end. The Special Rapporteur considers that the post-commission era 
presents a new phase for the human rights of the people of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea and the many victims from other countries, and requires a decisive 
change in the approach going forward. For more than 50 years, the question of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has always been regarded as a political issue within 
the United Nations, as shaped by its States Members, and addressed in a political manner. 
This would reflect and fluctuate in accordance with the international political situation. 
What has now happened with the report of the commission is that the situation in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has been decisively placed on the track of 
international law. This is not to say that the issue has been completely moved away from 
the political arena, where its security dimension remains of great concern; the commission&#8217;s 
report has, however, demonstrated the linkage between the internal situation with regard to 
the almost total denial of human rights and the security dimensions which, from time to 
time, manifest themselves in terms of aggressive behaviour by the State. With the 
commission&#8217;s findings, these political and security issues can only be settled or closed if 
these human rights violations are dealt with in a decisive manner. The commission clearly 
stated that it had reasonable grounds to conclude that crimes against humanity continue and 
that they have been taking place for decades. A core element in moving forward therefore is 
to pursue this matter from the perspective of international criminal justice and human rights 
law. 
</p>
<p>7. The phase is also new in several other important aspects. The first concerns the 
revelation of the truth. The second has to do with how the leadership of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea handles this revelation, as much as the heightened international 
scrutiny of its situation of human rights. The third focuses on the qualitative differences in 
responses that are required of Member States, neighbouring States and other States 
concerned, the United Nations system and its relevant bodies, other stakeholders and the 
international community as a whole. This will also require a realignment of and 
strengthening in the work of civil society and people-to-people contacts. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that all these aspects are interrelated and changes in one will inevitably 
affect those in another. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Revelation of the truth 
</b></p>
<p>8. One of the most striking observations that the Special Rapporteur has made 
throughout his mandate and during his work with the commission of inquiry is that, for so 
many years, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was able to conceal the true 
magnitude and gravity<b> </b>of its atrocities against its own people. In the past decade, the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council (and the Commission on Human Rights 
before 2006) adopted resolutions every year in which they expressed their deepest concern 
at the systematic, widespread and grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Year after year, the 
Government rejected those resolutions, denied such violations and refused to grant access 
to the international community to verify the situation.  
</p>
<p>9. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council in 2013,3 in which the Special 
Rapporteur made a comprehensive review of more than 60 United Nations reports and 
resolutions on the situation of human rights in Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
  A/HRC/22/57. </p>


<p>since 2004, he stated clearly that this status quo could not be allowed to continue in the face 
of such violations, such international condemnation and such non-cooperation. The 
establishment of the commission of inquiry, and its subsequent findings and 
recommendations, must also be seen in this context. It was the much-needed breakthrough 
that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, civil society and the Special 
Rapporteur himself had called for when they advocated for an international inquiry 
mechanism to investigate and more fully document the grave, systematic and widespread 
violations of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea as a step towards 
accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Crimes against humanity 
</b></p>
<p>10. The commission of inquiry found that crimes against humanity had been and 
continued to be committed by the institutions and officials of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State. These 
were not mere excesses of the State, but essential components of its political system. The 
gravity, scale and nature of these violations revealed a State that has no parallel in the 
contemporary world. The State strategically uses surveillance, coercion, fear and 
punishment to preclude the expression of any dissent. It uses executions and enforced 
disappearance to political prison camps to terrorize the population into submission. The 
State&#8217;s violence has been externalized through State-sponsored abductions and enforced 
disappearances of people from other nations. These international enforced disappearances 
are unique in their intensity, scale and nature.4 
</p>
<p>11. Anyone in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who is considered a threat to 
the political system and the leadership can become a target of these crimes against 
humanity. The primary victims included the estimated 80,000 to 120,000 inmates of the 
political prison camps; the inmates of the ordinary prison system, including the political 
prisoners among them; Christian and other religious believers, as well as others considered 
to introduce subversive influences; persons who try to flee the country, including persons 
forcibly repatriated by China; starving populations, and persons from Japan, the Republic 
of Korea and other countries who were abducted or denied repatriation, and became victims 
of international abductions and enforced disappearances.5 The ongoing plight of the 
prisoners held incommunicado in the political prison camps, whose existence the 
Government continues to deny, is cause for deep concern. The Special Rapporteur stresses 
that these camps must be shut down and that the prisoners must be released without delay. 
</p>
<p>12. Since the commission of inquiry released its report, the Special Rapporteur has been 
asked repeatedly about which of the commission&#8217;s findings could be considered &#8220;new&#8221;, 
given the previous documentation by civil society actors and the United Nations. It is a 
valid question. The Special Rapporteur believes that the answer explains why the revelation 
of the truth by the commission has been so powerful. 
</p>
<p>13. Firstly, the findings are the result of an intensive, systematic and transparent 
investigation that began with an open call for submissions by any party with information 
and documentation on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea itself, neighbouring States and other 
States concerned, State and non-State actors, civil society and individuals all had ample

<p>opportunity to provide information throughout the process. Regrettably, the commission 
received no cooperation from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and had no 
access to the country, despite having made numerous efforts to contact the Government. 
Some sceptics have sought to discredit the process followed by the commission, claiming 
that its findings were based solely on information provided by defectors; the Special 
Rapporteur, however, draws their attention to the fact that, in addition to the 80 victims and 
other witnesses who testified through public hearings and the more than 240 confidential 
interviews conducted, the commission also reviewed satellite images, internal documents 
brought out of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, as well as videos, photographs 
and written materials, including 80 submissions from various sources. The patterns of 
violations documented by the commission in its report were based on first-hand testimony 
from multiple witnesses, and corroborated by other information.  
</p>
<p>14. Investigating the nine patterns of violations identified by the Special Rapporteur in 
his report submitted in 2013,6 the commission of inquiry categorized the systematic, 
widespread and gross human rights violations that had been and continued to be committed 
into six categories: arbitrary detention, torture, executions and enforced disappearance to 
political prison camps; violations of the freedoms of thought, expression and religion; 
discrimination on the basis of State-assigned social class, gender, and disability; violations 
of the freedom of movement and residence, including the right to leave one&#8217;s own country; 
violations of the right to food and related aspects of the right to life; and enforced 
disappearance of persons from other countries, including through international abductions.  
</p>
<p>15. It was on the basis of this body of testimony and other information received 
concerning each of these patterns of violations that the commission determined that its 
findings constituted reasonable grounds to conclude that crimes against humanity had been 
committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea so as to merit a criminal 
investigation by a competent national or international organ of justice.7 It found that these 
crimes against humanity entailed extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, 
imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, 
religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced 
disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. 
The commission further found that crimes against humanity were ongoing in the State 
&#8220;because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in 
place&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. Following the track of international law  
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur cannot emphasize enough the significance of the 
international law implications of the revelation of the truth achieved by the commission of 
inquiry. For the first time ever, an investigation mandated by the highest inter-
governmental body within the United Nations system responsible for human rights, namely, 
the Human Rights Council, documented and concluded that a number of long-standing and 
ongoing patterns of systematic and widespread violations in Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea met the high threshold required for proof of crimes against humanity in 
international law.9 The perpetrators enjoy impunity because they act in accordance with 
State policy. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea is unwilling to implement its 
international obligation to prosecute and bring the perpetrators to justice.

<p>17. The main perpetrators, as documented by the commission of inquiry, include 
officials of the State Security Department, the Ministry of People&#8217;s Security, the Korean 
People&#8217;s Army, the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the judiciary and the Workers&#8217; Party of 
Korea, who are acting under the effective control of the central organs of the Workers&#8217; 
Party of Korea, the National Defence Commission and the Supreme Leader of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.10 
</p>
<p>18. The findings of the commission of inquiry, which indicated that the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, as a State Member of the United Nations, has committed 
crimes against humanity over a span of several decades, raised questions regarding the 
accountability of the international community. The commission recalled that the leaders 
gathered at the 2005 World Summit of Heads of State and Governments had reaffirmed that 
each individual State had the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war 
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, and that, in addition, world leaders 
had pledged to uphold the complementary responsibility to protect held by the international 
community.11 The commission also found that, in the light of the manifest failure of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to protect its population from crimes against 
humanity, the international community, through the United Nations, bears the responsibility 
to protect the population of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea from crimes against 
humanity using, first and foremost, appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful 
means. The responsibility of the international community was further warranted by the fact 
that the crimes of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea against humanity have an 
impact on many persons from other States, who were systematically abducted and who 
continued to suffer enforced disappearance, along with the families that they had left 
behind. In a number of these cases, the abductions involved blatant violations of the 
territorial sovereignty of other States.12 
</p>
<p>19. The international community must set in train immediate, impartial and just action 
to secure accountability, fulfil the responsibility to protect, put human rights first and stop 
grave human rights violations, in accordance with international law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Contextual factors affecting justice and reconciliation on the Korean 
peninsula 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur draws particular attention to one of the main findings of the 
commission of inquiry that has, however, generated less discussion than it deserves: the 
historical and political context of human rights violations in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea. The commission emphasized that the current situation of human rights 
in that country had been shaped by the historical experiences of the Korean people. 
Confucian social structures and the experience of the Japanese colonial occupation had to 
some degree informed the political structures and attitudes prevailing in the country today. 
The division imposed on the Korean peninsula, the massive destruction caused by the 
Korean War and the impact of the Cold War had engendered &#8220;an isolationist mindset and 
an aversion to outside powers that are used to justify internal repression&#8221;.13 
</p><p>21. The Special Rapporteur believes that genuine recognition of this historical and 
political context is essential for the international community if it is to to address 
meaningfully the situation human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
Among its recommendations, the commission made stated clearly that the international

<p>community had to accept its responsibility to protect the people of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea from crimes against humanity, because the Government had manifestly 
failed to do so. In particular, this responsibility had be accepted in the light of the role 
played by the international community (and by the great powers in particular) in the 
division of the Korean peninsula and because of the unresolved legacy of the Korean War. 
These unfortunate legacies helped not only to explain the intractability of the situation of 
human rights but also why an effective response was imperative.14 
</p>
<p>22. In a press statement issued on 15 November 2013, upon concluding an official visit 
to the Republic of Korea in November 2013,15 the Special Rapporteur stressed the need to 
look at issues related to human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea with a 
perspective paving the way for justice and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. In the 
light of the findings of the commission of inquiry, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the 
primary responsibility for the human rights of the people in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea lies with the Government. The international community must address the 
Government&#8217;s failure to do so and ensure accountability. Meanwhile, the international 
community cannot shy away from external factors, such as security concerns, inter-Korean 
relations and the regional dynamics around the peninsula and beyond, that also affect the 
considerations and the severely restrictive policies of the leadership of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. Unless these factors are taken into account, there will be no 
meaningful steps towards a settlement of the Korean question, which has a direct bearing 
on the human rights of the people on the Korean peninsula. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Responses of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>23. By providing a more holistic picture of the wide-ranging and gross human rights 
violations committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the findings of the 
commission of inquiry put an end to the decades-long cover-up of the true magnitude and 
gravity of the State&#8217;s atrocities against its own people. Now, not only does the world but 
also the leadership of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea know that the truth has 
been revealed, and that it is under increased scrutiny. This is powerful and can act as both a 
deterrent and an incentive to change course. This is one of the many reasons why the 
Special Rapporteur believes that change is possible.  
</p>
<p>24. Although the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has categorically rejected the 
commission of inquiry, the Special Rapporteur has observed some indication that it has 
been responding to the revelations; for instance, family reunions in the Korean Peninsula 
resumed in February 2014 for the first time since 2010.16 The announcement came earlier 
and preparations were under way, while the reunions were held shortly after the 
commission made its report public on 17 February 2014. A few days before the commission 
presented its report to the Human Rights Council and engaged in an interactive dialogue 
with the Council on its findings and recommendations on 17 March 2014, the Yokota 
family from Japan, after years of anguish since the abduction of their 13-year-old daughter 
Megumi in 1977, was able to meet and spend some time in Mongolia with their 
granddaughter and great granddaughter, who were born in Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea.17 Some might see these as coincidences. The Special Rapporteur believes that the

<p>revelation of the truth, international scrutiny and sustained pressure have had some initial 
effects and will continue to do so.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has always maintained its procedural 
objection to any country-specific mandate, citing this as the reason for which it refuses to 
cooperate with the Special Rapporteur. The State has nonetheless been willing to engage in 
the universal periodic review mechanism, which examines the situation of human rights in 
all States Members of the United Nations. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
participated in its first review in December 2009 and rejected 50 recommendations 
immediately afterwards. For more than four years thereafter, it failed to identify any 
recommendations that enjoyed its support or to report on any progress of their 
implementation.18 The General Assembly also, in its resolution 65/225, adopted at the end 
of 2010, expressed its serious concern at the refusal of the Government of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to articulate the recommendations that enjoyed its support 
following its review, and regretted the lack of actions taken to implement the 
recommendations contained in the final outcome. Despite similar concerns expressed by 
other parties, for three more years the Government maintained its ambiguous stance on the 
recommendations. It was only after the presentation of the commission&#8217;s findings before 
the Human Rights Council that the leadership of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea made any positive progress with regard to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>26. The second review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was held on 1 
May 2014. A few days before the review, the Government indicated that its position was 
that the State accepted 81 of the 167 recommendations made during the first cycle of the 
universal periodic review in December 2009.19 The Special Rapporteur notes the 
Government described the 81 accepted recommendations as &#8220;recommendations that are 
implemented or currently under implementation&#8221;. These recommendations mostly related 
to economic and social rights, women, children, a rights-based approach to development, 
and the reunion of separated families in the Korean peninsula. They also included some 
civil and political rights, which the Government claimed were being implemented. Notably, 
the Government also accepted recommendations to submit reports to the Human Rights 
Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. One 
of the recommendations accepted specifically called upon the Government to take measures 
to facilitate family reunification, as recommended by the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.20 Although 
belated, these are welcome developments. The Special Rapporteur will continue to seek to 
engage the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to ensure the implementation of the 
above recommendations, and encourages other Member States to do likewise. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review adopted the second review of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 6 May 2014. In its immediate response to 
the second review, the Government rejected 83 of the 268 recommendations made; for the 
others, the Government would provide responses in due time, but no later than the twenty-
seventh session of the Human Rights Council&#8221;. 21 If this were indeed to eventuate, it would 
mark a significant improvement in the Government&#8217;s cooperation with the universal 
periodic review mechanism.

<p>28. The Special Rapporteur urges Member States and all parties concerned, including 
the United Nations system and civil society, to seize the opportunities for engagement that 
the latest developments in the universal periodic review have created. Firstly, the 
international community must not take the recommendations accepted during the first 
review at face value. Whether bilaterally or through regional and international platforms, 
efforts must be made to ensure that the recommendations are implemented and that they 
bring about a genuine improvement in the daily life and human rights of the people. 
Secondly, the international community must encourage the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea to accept and implement more recommendations from the second review in a 
timely manner, in any case no later than the twenty-seventh session, in September 2014, 
when the Council is scheduled to adopt the report of the Working Group, and to commit to 
reporting on the progress of their implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Opportunities for engagement  
</b></p>
<p>29. In order to facilitate the above-mentioned process, the Special Rapporteur 
summarizes below the recommendations accepted by the State under review,22 which 
represent an opportunity for engagement, in particular those recommendations that are 
concrete and the implementation of which is verifiable. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>30. With regard to the scope of international obligations and the State&#8217;s cooperation 
with United Nations human rights mechanisms, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
has indicated that the recommendation that it fully comply with the principles and rights 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the two international covenants, 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, to which it is party (recommendation 3) had been 
implemented or was currently being implemented. It would also consider and envisage 
acceding to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (recommendations 2 
and 18) and improve its cooperation with United Nations treaty bodies by agreeing on 
timelines for submitting overdue reports, in particular to the Human Rights Committee and 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (recommendation 41). 
It would also pursue cooperation with the thematic procedures of the Human Rights 
Council (recommendation 54). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Violence against women: rights of vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea indicated that it had accepted several 
concrete recommendations that it combat violence against women, protect the rights of 
women, children, persons with disabilities and the elderly, and provide for the most 
vulnerable groups (recommendations 17, 19, 20, 38, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 64, 66, 67, 86, 87, 
96, 98 and 99); for example that it pass legislation specifically dealing with violence against 
women, including domestic violence, providing for prosecution of individuals committing 
acts of violence against women (recommendation 19); increase the number of women in 
management posts and in decision-making processes (recommendation 20); ensure that the 
rights of women, children and persons with disabilities are more effectively realized 
through the implementation of a number of specific national strategies (recommendation 
38); provide all children with equal opportunities to study and give them access to higher 
education based on their talent and individual capability (recommendation 60); and give 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22
  See A/HRC/13/13, para. 90. </p>


<p>priority to vulnerable groups in the distribution of international assistance (recommendation 
61). 
</p><p>32. Several of the recommendations accepted by the State concern protection issues and 
raising public awareness, with particular reference to victims of trafficking in persons, for 
example, that it establish a government task force to create protection programmes, provide 
resources for recovery and promote prevention through education and media campaigns 
(recommendation 27); step up measures to address comprehensively the problem of 
trafficking and violence against women, including by increasing public awareness 
campaigns (recommendation 69); and strengthen measures, including through international 
dialogue and cooperation, to combat human trafficking and provide appropriate assistance 
to victims of trafficking (recommendation 68). The Special Rapporteur believes, however, 
that such measures should be calibrated carefully to avoid restricting freedom of movement 
and the right to leave the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Structural reforms: the rights to food, health and education 
</b></p>
<p>33. Recommendations concerning the rights to food, health, education, water economic 
and social rights in general, humanitarian cooperation, and development also featured 
prominently among those accepted (recommendations 30-36, 60, 88-94, 96, 97, 99, 100-
105, 109, 112-115 and 117). They included recommendations concerning the 
implementation of a national plan of action of education for all with a view to improving 
the quality of the system of 11 years of compulsory, free, universal education, increasing 
progressively the necessary resources allocated for this purpose (recommendation 30); 
securing the right to food for all citizens, in particular in order to secure the right to health 
for children (recommendation 90); taking the steps necessary to ensure impartial access to 
adequate food, drinking water and other basic necessities for all people within the State&#8217;s 
jurisdiction, including vulnerable groups (recommendation 92); and strengthening 
cooperation with the United Nations and its mechanisms on human rights and humanitarian 
matters with a view to building national capacities and improving the people&#8217;s well-being 
(recommendation 114). In particular, the Government also indicated that it had accepted the 
recommendation that the State continue efforts to reinvigorate the national economy by, 
inter alia, allowing more freedom for people to engage in economic and commercial 
activities (recommendation 88). 
34. On structural reforms and the allocation of resources, the Government indicated that 
it had accepted recommendations to invest sufficient resources to promote and protect the 
principle of equality in the fields of work, education and health (recommendation 59); to 
allocate resources equitably and to implement food security policies, including through 
sustainable agricultural practices and reduced State restrictions on the cultivation and trade 
of foodstuffs (recommendation 94); to increase resources allocated to the education sector 
for better quality of education, and to encourage the authorities to continue their efforts in 
this area (recommendation 103); and to work on overcoming the obstacles related to 
economic problems and the scarcity of resources through cooperation with the international 
community and the United Nations so as to ensure the promotion and protection of human 
rights (recommendation 115). The Special Rapporteur is keen to see these commitments 
translated into a real readjustment of the State&#8217;s <i>songbun</i> military first policy, which 
prioritizes militarization in the allocation of limited resources. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Family reunions 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea also indicated that it had accepted to 
guarantee separated families&#8217; fundamental right to know the fate of their family members 
across the border and to communicate and regularly meet together; do everything possible, 
in cooperation with the Republic of Korea, to ensure that the maximum number of meetings 
of separated families is organized, take concrete steps to continue the process of family </p>


<p>reunification, &#8220;because for the elder generation even a delay of one or two years means that 
their chance of seeing their relatives may be lost forever&#8221;; and adopt measures to facilitate 
family reunification, as recommended by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (recommendations 75-78). Of the 
relevant recommendations made by the current mandate holder and the previous one over 
the years, the Special Rapporteur draws special attention to the recommendation that family 
reunions become a sustained process moving beyond short-term meetings to life-long 
reunification,23 and looks forward its concrete implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Freedoms, treatment of persons under detention, and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned at the number of recommendations 
relating to freedoms, fair trial, the treatment of persons in detention and the accountability 
of those committing human rights abuses that the Government indicated as accepted and 
already implemented or currently being implemented. These recommendations included 
that the State continue to prevent and to punish human rights abuses by law enforcement 
officials (recommendation 61); give all in detention a fair trial (recommendation 72); train 
professionals involved in the judicial system on the relevant international standards on a 
fair trial and rule of law (recommendation 73); ensure that all persons deprived of their 
liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human 
being (recommendation 74); allow the exercise of the right to the freedom of expression 
and the freedom of association and assembly by fostering and facilitating civil society 
entities and enabling them to obtain status under law (recommendation 79); and take further 
steps to support freedom of expression and the right to freedom of movement 
(recommendation 84). The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned because the claim by 
the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea that the recommendations 
were already implemented or currently being implemented contrasts starkly with the 
findings documented by the commission of inquiry and the information received by the 
Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>37. At its second periodic review, the delegation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea asserted that political prison camps did not exist and were a &#8220;complete fabrication&#8221;; 
furthermore, persons sentenced to the penalty of reform through labour under the country&#8217;s 
Criminal Law served their terms in reform institutions.24 On a number of freedoms widely 
documented as being seriously curtailed, the Government claimed that the Constitution of 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea also guaranteed freedom of religion, and that 
the State respected religious life and ceremonies of religious people and ensured the 
freedom to set up churches and other religious buildings.25 Freedom to travel was fully 
guaranteed by both the Constitution and the law; persons in the country could travel abroad 
after complying with the necessary formalities. People were furthermore free to travel 
anywhere within the country, &#8220;with the exception of the frontlines and areas with military 
installations where one can travel after obtaining permission&#8221;,26 while freedom of 
expression was &#8220;a fundamental human right protected by law&#8221;. The people in the country 
were able to freely express their views through radios, newspapers and magazines; any 
violation of these rights was subject to legal punishment.27 
</p><p>38. The above responses given by the Government reflect total denial of the actual 
situation; similarly, its blatant denial of the systematic human rights violations and the

<p>numerous cases of international abduction and enforced disappearances,28 as documented 
by the commission of inquiry in its report, is totally unacceptable. If accepted at face value, 
this conduct, despite the consistent and credible evidence gathered also by other 
mechanisms of the Human Rights Council itself, could seriously undermine the whole 
universal periodic review process with the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, running 
counter to the principles that the review be a cooperative mechanism, based on objective 
and reliable information and on dialogue, thus undermining its objective of improving the 
situation of human rights on the ground. This should also be food for thought for those 
Member States that did not support the commission of inquiry or Human Rights Council 
resolution 25/25 by arguing that the universal periodic review mechanism rather than a 
country-specific initiative would be preferable to address the situation.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The way forward: the responses required of all parties 
concerned  
</b></p>
<p>39.<b> In its resolution 25/25, the Human Rights Council called upon all parties 
concerned, including United Nations bodies, to consider implementation of the 
recommendations made by the commission of inquiry in its report in order to address 
the dire human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. The 
Special Rapporteur interprets &#8220;all parties concerned&#8221; as all-encompassing; this 
includes Member States, the United Nations system and its relevant bodies, 
neighbouring States and other States concerned, relevant international, regional and 
national bodies, civil society, individuals, the international community as a whole, and 
possibly other stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>40.<b> Unlike in the previous two years, when the Human Rights Council adopted its 
annual resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea (resolution 19/13 in 2012 and resolution 22/13 in 2013) without a 
vote, resolution 25/25 was adopted by a vote, requested by Cuba; the result was 30 
votes in favour (Argentina, Austria, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, 
Costa Rica, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, 
Japan, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Peru, Philippines, 
Republic of Korea, Romania, Sierra Leone, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, United States of America), 6 against (China, Cuba, Pakistan, Russian 
Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam), with 11 abstentions 
(Algeria, Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Kuwait, Namibia, Saudi 
Arabia, South Africa). The position of each of the 47 States Members of the Council 
has been recorded and is a matter of public and historical record. The Special 
Rapporteur observes that both during the interactive dialogue with the commission of 
inquiry and when the resolution was adopted on 28 March 2014, none, with the 
exception of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, denied that the dire human 
rights situation had to be addressed. Of the countries that did not join the majority of 
30 members voting in favour of the resolution, most &#8211; if not all &#8211; cited procedural 
reasons or differences in approach. They reiterated their reservations about country-
specific mandates, and expressed preference for other mechanisms, in particular the 
universal periodic review, and urged engagement, dialogue and cooperation. The 
Special Rapporteur stresses that different mechanisms exist for good reasons, and that 
they are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, ultimately they serve and share the common 
goal to better promote and protect human rights for all.

<p><b> A. Genuine results to ease suffering on the ground 
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges all concerned parties, and in particular the 
Member States that support the universal periodic review, to seize the opportunity 
provided by the 81 recommendations that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
accepted voluntarily at its first review. In the face of the systematic, widespread and 
gross human rights violations documented by the commission of inquiry, no 
responsible member of the international community should be allowed to hide behind 
a procedural difference and idly stand by. It is therefore important to show that the 
universal periodic review process can yield result, not just on paper but in action. 
Many of the recommendations made at the second review overlap or build upon the 
81 recommendations accepted by the State under review. In the time remaining before 
the twenty-seventh session of Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur calls 
upon all Member States to engage with the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
accept and agree on concrete steps for implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>42.<b> In the above context, the Special Rapporteur draws special attention to the 
immediate steps that the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 25/25, urged the 
Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to take:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To ensure the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as 
well as the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and association, including by 
permitting the establishment of independent newspapers and other media; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To end discrimination against citizens, including State-sponsored 
discrimination based on the <i>songbun</i> system, and to take immediate steps to ensure 
gender equality and to protect women from gender-based violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To ensure the right to freedom of movement, including the freedom to 
choose one&#8217;s place of residence and employment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To promote equal access to food, including through full transparency 
regarding the provision of humanitarian assistance, so that such assistance is 
genuinely provided to vulnerable persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To immediately halt all human right violations relating to prison camps, 
including the practice of forced labour, to dismantle all political prison camps and 
release all political prisoners, and to ensure that justice sector reforms provide 
protections for a fair trial and due process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) To allow all persons who have been abducted or otherwise forcibly 
disappeared, as well as their descendants, to return immediately to their countries of 
origin. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>Most of the above steps are similar to the substance of the universal periodic 
review recommendations acceptance by the State under review. The Government may 
choose to call those detained as reformed &#8220;through labour&#8221;, serving their terms in 
&#8220;reform institutions&#8221;,</b>29<b> and deny the existence of political prison camps. Names aside, 
the same principles apply. The Government, through the universal periodic review 
mechanism, accepted to give all in detention a fair trial and to treat all persons 
deprived of their liberty with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of 
the human being. There is no reason why the Government should not be asked to 
demonstrate that it meant what it said. The Special Rapporteur encourages Member 
States to follow up the recommendation made by the commission of inquiry to form a 
human rights contact group to raise concerns about the situation of human rights in

<p><b>the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and to provide support for initiatives to 
improve it, fully utilizing all available mechanisms to achieve tangible results. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Key elements of a strategy to address international abductions and 
enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>44.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to share a few observations and suggestions 
about the way forward with the neighbouring States</b> <b>and</b> <b>other States concerned, 
firstly on the issue of international abductions and enforced disappearances. The 
commission of inquiry recommended that the Special Rapporteur develop a strategy, 
involving all concerned United Nations human rights mechanisms, to address the issue 
of international abduction, enforced disappearances and related matters coherently 
and without delay. It also recommended that Member States afford full cooperation to 
ensure the implementation of such a strategy. The Special Rapporteur stresses that 
this issue, and the strategy being developed, is of upmost importance and will always 
be an integral part of the follow-up work in the way forward. The gravity of the 
commission&#8217;s findings and the clarity it has given to the issue of international 
abductions and enforced disappearances have energized all concerned as a strategy is 
being developed to address this important issue. 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> The commission of inquiry found that, since 1950, the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea has engaged in the systematic abduction, denial of repatriation and 
subsequent enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a large scale 
and as a matter of State policy. Well over 200,000 persons, including children, have 
been taken from other countries to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and 
many were never heard of again. This figure includes those who left for the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in the context of the Korean War.</b>30<b> They may 
have potentially become victims of enforced disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p>46.<b> During his visit to Japan from 8 to 10 April 2014, as an immediate follow-up to 
the work of the commission of inquiry, the Special Rapporteur was informed by the 
authorities that, in addition to the 19 Japanese persons who had been confirmed 
victims of abduction by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, there were 
currently 860 missing persons who could not be ruled out as have been abducted by 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In addition to holding discussions with 
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Abduction Issues and other relevant 
authorities, for the first time in his visit as the mandate holder, the families of victims 
of abduction and a wide range of civil society actors met with him together to share 
information and discuss the way forward. The Special Rapporteur was deeply 
encouraged by the sense of unity and commitment to seeking closure to this issue.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. An international approach  
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>One of the key elements of the strategy developed by the Special Rapporteur is 
the international perspective and approach required to address the issue of 
international abductions and enforced disappearances. This is no longer only a 
bilateral issue between Japan and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, but one 
that concerns other countries and the international community at large.  
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The commission of inquiry found that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea had used its land, naval and intelligence forces to conduct abductions and 
arrests. Operations were approved at the level of the Supreme Leader. The vast

  Report of the detailed findings of the commission of inquiry (see footnote 5), para. 1011. </p>


<p><b>majority of victims were forcibly disappeared to gain labour and other skills for the 
State. Some victims were used to further espionage and terrorist activities. Women 
abducted from Europe, the Middle East and Asia were subjected to forced marriages 
with men from other countries to prevent liaisons on their part with ethnic Korean 
women that could result in interracial children. Some of the abducted women had also 
been subject to sexual exploitation.</b>31<b> Furthermore, ethnic Koreans from the Republic 
of Korea and Japan, forcibly disappeared by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, had been discriminated against for their origins and background, categorized 
as &#8220;hostile&#8221; and forced to work in mines and farms in remote marginalized areas of 
the country.</b>32<b> Since the 1990s, agents of the State had abducted a number of persons 
from Chinese territory, including nationals of China, the Republic of Korea and, in at 
least one case, a former Japanese national.</b>33<b>In addition to victims from China, Japan 
and the Republic of Korea, nationals of Lebanon, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and 
Romania, and possibly others,</b>34<b> were among the cases of international abduction and 
enforced disappearances recorded by the commission.</b>35<b> The Special Rapporteur will 
be contacting these States to seek further information and to engage them in follow-up 
actions on behalf of their missing citizens. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Engagement of civil society and contact with local communities  
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> If the new strategy currently being developed is to succeed in addressing the 
issue of international abductions and enforced disappearances, the international 
community must work together. All Governments concerned, families, civil society 
and relevant United Nations mechanisms should engage strategically in this new phase 
of work. In addition, the strategy must also involve the general public, in particular in 
the countries concerned, so that communities in different locations may be informed 
and hence empowered to share available information with the international 
mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that Human Rights Council, 
in its resolution 25/25, specifically requested sustained communications, advocacy and 
outreach initiatives to maintain visibility of the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. He plans to use this new communications 
capacity as he pursues a strategy, involving all concerned United Nations human 
rights mechanisms, to address the issue of international abduction, enforced 
disappearances and related matters coherently and without delay. He stresses that, in 
addition to the official languages of the United Nations, outreach should be conducted 
in relevant languages, in particular Korean and Japanese, so that the general public in 
the countries concerned may be effectively reached, and results achieved.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Closure and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned at the continued denial by the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, during its second universal periodic review, 
of the scale of the issue of international abduction and enforced disappearances, as 
well as the need to bring closure and ensure accountability, claining that no citizens of 
any countries other than Japan had been abducted. The delegation added that the 
issue had been completely resolved as a result of the efforts made by the Democratic

  The commission of inquiry considered it possible that other foreigners, especially foreign women,

Declaration published in September 2002&#8221;,</b>36<b> and that the issue of prisoners of war 
had been settled in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, while the issue of the 
&#8220;abduction of south Koreans&#8221; did not exist.</b>37<b> Such blatant denial of the facts in the 
face of the systematic violations and numerous cases documented by the commission 
of inquiry cannot be left unchallenged. The Special Rapporteur stresses the gravity of 
the commission&#8217;s findings and the clarity that it has given to the issue of international 
abductions and enforced disappearances have energized all concerned to work 
together, bring closure to victims&#8217; families and loved ones, and ensure accountability. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Neighbouring States and other States concerned 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>On the issue of refoulement, the commission of inquiry recommended that 
China and other States should respect the principle of non-refoulement and, 
accordingly, abstain from forcibly repatriating any persons to the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.</b>38<b> The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call upon all 
countries where persons from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea have sought 
refuge or are transiting to protect such persons, to treat them humanely and to adhere 
to the principle of non-refoulement.  
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> With regard to the role of China and the possible ways forward, the Special 
Rapporteur draws attention to a number of pertinent issues and observes that China 
is in a challenging and an unenviable situation. Most of the nationals of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who manage to flee the country cross the 
border with China, and will continue to do so. The current handling of the movement 
of people across the borders is far from ideal, can easily lead to abuses and is not at all 
sustainable. The Special Rapporteur makes himself available to engage in a 
constructive dialogue with China to help find a way forward. The current situation 
harms all concerned, including the people of China, and must not continue. In 
addition, many women are trafficked by force or deception from the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea into China for the purposes of exploitation. The 
commission of inquiry found that an estimated 20,000 children born to women from 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea were currently in China, without proper 
access to education, and health care, and nationality and birth registration.</b>39<b> The 
Special Rapporteur remains deeply disturbed by the widespread practice of 
infanticide and the murder of half-Chinese children in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, as revealed by the investigation conducted by the commission of 
inquiry,</b>40<b> corroborated by several witnesses as well as in the latest universal periodic 
review documentation concerning the treatment of minorities in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.</b> 41<b> This, too, must be stopped.

<p>53.<b> The Special Rapporteur points out that the cooperation of China is a key factor 
in bringing meaningful change to the situation of human rights in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. This applies to the people-to-people and other forms of 
contact and information flow above and beyond those at the official level.

<p><b>example, allowed citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea greater access 
to information from outside the country. Outside information, notably from and 
through China, is increasingly finding its way into the country. The Special 
Rapporteur values the cooperation of China and is determined to assist it in 
addressing the consequences of the dire situation of human rights in the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The Special Rapporteur was able to gain an insight into the issues and factors 
that have an impact on inter-Korean relations during his fact-finding mission to the 
Republic of Korea in November 2011.</b>42<b> Such issues can affect a wide range of human 
rights, such as the reunification of the thousands of separated families on the Korean 
peninsula. He encourages the two Governments to disconnect the issue of family 
reunions from any political or other consideration, such as the provision of 
humanitarian aid. The reunions must be regular, frequent and inclusive, and become 
part of a sustained process moving beyond short-term meetings to life-long 
reunification. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed by relevant 
authorities that an interministerial structure had been set up to coordinate and handle 
various aspects of issues relating to refugees from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. This is a welcome move, given that those seeking to leave the country are at 
risk of trafficking and exploitation, while many may also have long-term 
rehabilitation needs and whose full integration into society upon their arrival in the 
Republic of Korea should be facilitated.</b>43<b>  
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> As the international community and all parties concerned embark on this new 
phase of work for human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the 
Special Rapporteur encourages the various political parties in the Republic of Korea 
to make a concerted effort to provide the much-needed focus, energy and sense of 
direction for the Korean people to foster dialogue and shape the future of inter-Korea 
relations on the basis of justice and reconciliation through respect for human rights, 
while in the meantime helping to ease the ongoing suffering of the people of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.

<p>56.<b> The commission of inquiry pointed out the fact that the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, a State Member of the United Nations, had for decades pursued 
policies involving crimes that shock the conscience of humanity raised questions about 
the inadequacy of the response of the international community.</b>44<b> The commission 
therefore made a number of recommendations addressed to the international 
community and the United Nations.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The Security Council has a key role in ensuring accountability of those 
responsible for crimes against humanity committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s

<p><b>2014. Of the 13 members present,</b>45<b> the 11 members who spoke all suggested, to 
various degrees, that the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea be formally incorporated into the Council&#8217;s agenda. Several also 
called for regular briefings on the situation by the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur. Six of the 11 members explicitly called 
for a referral of the situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the 
International Criminal Court for action in accordance with that court&#8217;s jurisdiction, 
as recommended by the commission of inquiry.</b>46<b> The other five indicated that it was 
incumbent upon the Security Council to consider the matter and referral to the 
International Criminal Court. The report of the commission has been circulated as a 
Security Council document (S/2014/276). 
</b>58.<b> The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 25/25, recommended that the 
General Assembly submit the report of the commission of inquiry to the Security 
Council for its consideration and appropriate action in order that those responsible 
for human rights violations, including those that may amount to crimes against 
humanity, were held to account, including through consideration of referral of the 
situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the appropriate 
international criminal justice mechanism, and consideration of the scope for effective 
targeted sanctions against those who appear to be most responsible for crimes against 
humanity, taking into account the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the 
commission of inquiry. The commission briefed and discussed its findings and 
recommendations at a side event to the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly 
on 16 April 2014. In the past two years, the Assembly has adopted its annual 
resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea without a vote. In its resolution 68/183, the Assembly requested the Special 
Rapporteur to continue to report his findings and recommendations, as well as to 
report on the outcome of and follow-up to the work of the commission of inquiry, in 
line with any decisions of the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session. The 
Special Rapporteur will further update the Assembly in his report to be submitted to 
the Assembly later in 2014. In the light of the grave findings and recommendations of 
the commission of inquiry, the Assembly should, possibly in its relevant resolution on 
the State at its next session, send an unequivocal signal that the international 
community is prepared to take the follow-up to the work of the commission and 
Human Rights Council resolution 25/25 to a new level. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> In its resolution 68/183, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General 
to submit a comprehensive report on the situation the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
of Korea. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 25/25, requested the Office of 
the High Commissioner to report on its follow-up efforts in the regular annual report 
of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, effective as of the sixty-ninth session of 
the Assembly. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> In the light of the above, the commission of inquiry, in its report, recommended 
that the United Nations Secretariat and agencies should urgently adopt and 
implement a common &#8220;Rights up Front&#8221; strategy to ensure that all engagement with 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea effectively takes into account, and 
addresses, human rights concerns.</b>47<b> The Special Rapporteur is encouraged that, in his

General expressed his commitment to follow up on the commission&#8217;s

<p><b>recommendations and to support to a United Nations system-wide &#8220;Rights up Front&#8221; 
response to the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is fully cognizant of the important 
humanitarian work that the United Nations and other entities are doing in the 
country. He draws attention to the commission&#8217;s recommendations, and indeed that of 
the Special Rapporteur throughout his work, that States should not use the provision 
of food and other essential humanitarian assistance to impose economic or political 
pressure on the State. Humanitarian assistance should be provided in accordance with 
humanitarian and human rights principles, including the principle of non-
discrimination. Aid should only be curbed to the extent that unimpeded international 
humanitarian access and related monitoring is not adequately guaranteed.</b>48<b> The 
Special Rapporteur hopes that all parts of the United Nations system will rise to the 
challenge and work and deliver in a coordinated and unified manner, as envisaged in 
the Secretary-General&#8217;s &#8220;Rights up Front&#8221; initiative in response to the commission&#8217;s 
report. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> In its resolution 25/25, the Human Rights Council specifically requested the 
Office of the High Commissioner to follow up urgently on the recommendations made 
by the commission of inquiry in its report, and to provide the Special Rapporteur with 
increased support, including through the establishment of a field-based structure to 
strengthen monitoring and documentation of the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, to ensure accountability, to enhance 
engagement and capacity-building with the Governments of all States concerned, civil 
society and other stakeholders, and to maintain visibility of the situation of human 
rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including through sustained 
communications, advocacy and outreach initiatives. The Special Rapporteur stresses 
that the implementation of that recommendation requires the proactive engagement 
of all parties concerned with the utmost urgency. In order for the field-based 
structure to be effective, it has to build on the achievements of the commission of 
inquiry. The Special Rapporteur considers it important for the structure to be as near 
as possible to the main source of information, and its impact also partly depends on 
whether its presence in the region is felt. It must also be able to function with the same 
independence and objectivity as the commission, in accordance with the principles of 
the United Nations. Given the persistent denial of access to the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, it is not realistic to establish a field-based structure in Pyongyang. 
All things considered, it was the commission&#8217;s view that the Republic of Korea would 
be the optimal location for the field structure. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that 
the acceptance by the Republic of Korea to host the structure.</b>49<b> He hopes that the 
structure will be soon operational and trusts that its staff will be able to function in 
full accordance with the principles of the United Nations and with unimpeded access 
to witnesses, in order to ensure the continuation of monitoring and documentation of 
evidence.

<p>62.<b> Lastly, the Special Rapporteur pays tribute to the incessant work of civil 
society, which has played a decisive role in bringing the human rights agenda of the 
situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea as far as it has come today. In 
this new phase of work, the Special Rapporteur encourages civil society actors, 
regardless of their location, ideology, focus or approach to the way forward, to work 
together.
