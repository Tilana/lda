<p><b>  19/.. Birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition 
</b></p>
<p><b>everywhere as a person before the law 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United 
Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
Assembly established the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the human right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person 
before the law, which is enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the obligation of States to register all children immediately after birth as 
provided for in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and other relevant international instruments,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council calling upon States to ensure the registration of all children immediately after birth, 
the most recent being Assembly resolution 65/197 of 21 December 2010 and Council 
resolution 16/12 of 24 March 2011, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of birth registration, including late birth registration, as 
a means for providing an official record of the existence of a person and the recognition of 
that individual as a person before the law; expressing concern that unregistered individuals 
have limited or no access to services and enjoyment of all the rights to which they are 
entitled; also taking into consideration that persons without birth registration may be 
vulnerable to statelessness and associated lack of protection; and aware that registering a 
person&#8217;s birth is a vital step towards his or her protection,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the importance of birth registration, including late birth 
registration, for the development of vital statistics and the effective implementation of 
programmes and policies intended to achieve internationally agreed development goals, 
including the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> <i>concern</i> at the high number of persons throughout the world whose 
birth is not registered;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reminds</i> States of their obligation to undertake birth registration without 
discrimination of any kind;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to establish or strengthen existing governmental institutions 
responsible for birth registration and the preservation and security of such records, and to 
ensure they have sufficient resources to fulfil their mandate;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to ensure free birth registration, including free or low-
fee late birth registration, by means of universal, accessible, simple, expeditious and 
effective registration procedures without discrimination of any kind;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Further calls upon </i>States to continuously raise awareness at national and 
local levels on birth registration, including by engagement in public campaigns that raise 
awareness on the importance of birth registration for the effective access to services and 
enjoyment of all rights;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States to identify and remove physical, administrative and any other 
barriers that impede access to birth registration, including late registration, paying due 
attention to, among others, those barriers relating to poverty, disability, multicultural 
contexts and persons in vulnerable situations;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> States to request technical assistance, if required, from relevant 
United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes, including the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
World Health Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and the United Nations Development Programme, and other relevant 
stakeholders in order to fulfil their obligation to undertake birth registration as a means to 
respect the right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> the above-mentioned United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and 
programmes and other relevant stakeholders to cooperate with States in providing technical 
assistance, upon request; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue in accordance with its annual programme of 
work.
