5.      
After carefully considering your Plea to be unequivocal, this Court found both of you guilty for aggravated burglary and theft and accordingly you are convicted under Section 313 (1) (a) and Section 291 (1) (c) of the Crimes Decree respectively.

Considering the tariff for the offence of Aggravated Burglary in Tabeusi v State HAC 95-113/2010 and Mucunabitu v State HAC 17 of 2010 the Court accepted between 18 months to 3 years as tariff.

10.     
Tariff for the offence of theft was discussed in several cases. In Saukilagi v State [2005] FJHC 13 HAC 0021/2004 (27 January 2005) the Court accepted between 2 to 9 months as tariff for simple theft.

"The tariff for simple larceny on first conviction is 2-9 months (Ronald Vikash Singh v. State HAA 035 of 2002) and on second conviction a sentence in excess of 9 months. In cases of the larceny of large amounts of money sentences of 1 ½ years imprisonment (Isoa Codrokadroka v. State Crim. App. HAA 67 of 2002) and 3 years imprisonment have been upheld by the High Court (Sevanaia Via Koroi v. State Crim. App. HAA 031 of 2001S). Much depends on the value of the money stolen, and the nature of the relationship between victim and the defendant. The method of stealing is also relevant."

11.     
The first accused, you have 15 previous convictions. The 2nd accused you are a first offender.

12.     
Considering the nature of the offence and all other circumstances, I commence your sentence for the 1st count at 30 months.

13.     
State had submitted following aggravating factors:

(a)     
According to the victim impact statement, complainants no longer feel secure in their own home and no longer able to sleep comfortably through the night.

14.     
I increase your sentence by 3 months for the above aggravating factor. Now your sentence is 33 months.

15.

(a)     
You are single parent and father of 10 year old son-your wife was killed during the pending of this case.

(b)     
You are remorseful.

16.     
I deduct 3 months for the above mitigating factors. Now your sentence is 30 months. I deduct 6 months for the guilty plea. Now your sentence is 24 months. You have been in remand from 13th March 2012. I deduct 18 months for that period. Now your sentence is 6 months.

17.     
Mitigating circumstances of the 2nd accused are:

19.     
For your guilty plea I deduct 6 months. Now your sentence is 21 months.

20.     
I deduct 2 more months for the time period you spend in remand. Now your sentence is 19 months.

21.     
I take a starting point of 18 months in respect of the theft charge against the 1st accused. I add 2 months for the aggravating circumstances and deduct 3 months for mitigating circumstances. Now your sentence is 17 months. 

22.     
I take a starting point of 8 months in respect of the theft charge against the 2nd accused. I add 1 month for the aggravating circumstances and deduct 4 months for the mitigating circumstances. Now your sentence is 5 months.

23.     
Both the offences stated above were committed in the course of same transaction, therefore, I order both sentences to run concurrently.

First accused, you are sentenced for 6 months for the first count and 17 months for the second count. Both sentences to run concurrently.
