<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-fifth session 
</b>Agenda item 3 
<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  25/14. 
The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council on the right to food, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
on the issue, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council, at which 
the Council analysed the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the 
realization of the right to food for all, and Council resolutions S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 9/6 of 
18 September 2008 and 12/10 of 1 October 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and well-being, 
including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition 
and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular Millennium Development 
Goal 1 on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger by 2015,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in which the right of everyone to adequate food, including the fundamental 
right of every person to be free from hunger, is recognized, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 
2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 
2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible 
Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing 
Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to 
Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of 
</p>

<p>National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that the right to food is the right of every individual, alone or in 
community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, 
adequate and culturally acceptable food that is produced and consumed sustainably, 
preserving access to food for future generations,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security 
contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 
November 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and 
economic environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential 
foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty 
eradication, 
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration 
of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument 
of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of 
international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from 
unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the 
United Nations and that endanger food security, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and 
capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of 
Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize 
collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked 
institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities 
are essential, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger, food insecurity 
and malnutrition have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress 
made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless 
urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also </i>the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right 
to food is threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major 
factors, such as the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, 
desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the 
lack of development in many countries and transfer of relevant technology to address this 
issue, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island and 
vulnerable developing States, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the 
right to food, in particular in the said countries,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading 
system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, 
thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, 
</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i> to act to ensure that the full realization of all human rights, including the 
right to development, is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels 
in addressing the global food crisis, <b> </b></p>


<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including 
women farmers, family farmers and farmers in less favour areas, cooperatives and 
indigenous and local communities in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of 
life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of reversing the substantial decline in assistance devoted to 
agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to 
agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails a sustainable 
increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder 
and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, family farmers and farmers in less 
favoured areas, and groups in the most vulnerable situations, as well as national and 
international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in 
agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible 
Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food 
Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 
May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations at its 144th session, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development, entitled &#8220;The future we want&#8221;, endorsed by the General 
Assembly in its resolution 66/288 on 27 July 2012,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the ongoing inclusive consultative process within the Committee on 
World Food Security to develop voluntary and non-binding principles for responsible 
agricultural investments, intended for all stakeholders that are involved in, benefit from or 
are affected by those principles, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity 
and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and 
international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient<b> </b>and 
nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of 
everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her 
physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Considers it intolerable</i> that, as estimated by the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 do so from 
hunger-related illness, that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, the number of people who are chronically undernourished is about 842 
million worldwide, and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious 
malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter 
organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses its deep concern</i> that, according to the report of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled <i>The State of Food Insecurity in the 
World 2013</i>, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and 98 
per cent of undernourished people in the world live in developing countries; </p>


<p>5. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis 
continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, 
particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world 
financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-
importing developing countries, especially on least developed countries; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also</i> <i>expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> that women and girls are disproportionately 
affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and 
discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from 
malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice 
as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p><b>7</b>. <i>Encourages</i> all States to take action to address de jure and de facto gender 
inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the 
malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization 
of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to social protection and to 
resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal 
access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their 
families; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of smallholder and subsistence farmers in 
developing countries, including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring 
food security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their 
development; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to 
mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and 
mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate into, and 
effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective in, their relevant 
policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious 
food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> States to take steps with a view to progressively achieve the full 
realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for 
everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food 
and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms and 
to adopt national plans to combat hunger; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Underlines</i> the significance of national government policies and strategies in 
food production, poverty alleviation and social protection; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Recognizes</i> the advances made through South-South cooperation in 
developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of 
agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to 
increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation and to promote 
triangular cooperation further; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, 
inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples and local 
communities; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the 
right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated 
response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional 
efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to </p>


<p>food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, 
food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food security, with special 
attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted 
technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing 
services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1 and article 11, 
paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and 
assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the 
measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human 
rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative 
impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free 
from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Stresses</i> that improving access to productive resources and investment in 
rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in 
developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate, 
small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability 
to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological 
approaches; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Recognizes</i> that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per 
cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food 
insecurity given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to 
land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; 
that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting 
land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other 
associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by 
States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the 
facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and 
empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for 
food security and the provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through 
national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land 
degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to 
the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious 
Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Recalls</i> the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and 
challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take 
special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and 
malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Requests</i> all States and private actors, and international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective 
realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a 
human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; </p>


<p>24. <i>Recognizes</i> the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, 
towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop 
national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of 
hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>25.<i> Takes note with appreciation</i> of the growing movement, in different regions 
of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in 
support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Stresses</i> the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt 
relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable 
food security policies; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Calls for</i> the early conclusion to and a successful, development-oriented 
outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a 
contribution to creating international conditions permitting the full realization of the right to 
food; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Stresses</i> that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in 
order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the 
realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views 
of all stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Recalls</i> the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty;  
</p>
<p>31. <i>Recognizes</i> that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to 
halve the number of people who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while 
recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and 
international financial and development institutions, as well as relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim 
of halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from 
hunger, as stated in Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out 
in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration; 
</p>
<p>32. <i>Reaffirms</i> that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all 
people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive 
effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases;  
</p>
<p>33. <i>Calls upon</i> all States and, if appropriate, relevant international organizations:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>)  To combat the different forms of malnutrition as a means to realize the right 
to adequate food, including, if appropriate, by adopting a national strategy in this regard;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>)  To take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating the 
irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in particular by targeting 
the first thousand days of a child&#8217;s life; </p>


<p>(<i>c</i>)  To support the national plans and programmes of countries to improve 
nutrition in poor households, in particular plans and programmes that are aimed at 
combating undernutrition in mothers and children, and those targeting the irreversible 
effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, from gestation to the age of 2 years;  
</p>
<p>34. <i>Urges</i> States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>35. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international cooperation and development 
assistance as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of 
agriculture and its environmental sustainability, and the provision of humanitarian food 
assistance in activities relating to emergency situations for the realization of the right to 
food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country 
has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and 
strategies in this regard; 
</p>
<p>36. <i>Invites</i> all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive 
impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the 
implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the 
fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on 
the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>37. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Working 
Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the private sector to the 
realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring sustainable water 
resources for human consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p>38. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with 
relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in 
particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food 
Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further 
within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the 
advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least 
developed countries; 
</p>
<p>39. <i>Expresses</i> <i>concern</i> at the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to 
adequate food of insufficient purchasing power and the increased price volatility of 
agricultural commodities on international markets, particularly on people in developing 
countries and on net food-importing countries; 
</p>
<p>40. <i>Stresses</i> the need to address the root causes of excessive food price volatility, 
including its structural causes, at all levels, and the need to manage the risks linked to still 
high and excessively volatile prices in agriculture commodities and their consequences for 
global food security and nutrition, as well as for smallholder farmers and poor urban 
dwellers;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41.  <i>Reaffirms </i>that all States should take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization 
of the right to food by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of 
legislative measures; 
</p>
<p>42. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur, within his existing mandate, to explore, 
in consultation with Member States and relevant stakeholders, ways and means of raising 
the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, including least developed and </p>


<p>net food-importing developing countries, to ensure the realization and protection of the 
right to adequate food for their populations, and to report on his findings to the Human 
Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>43. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur;1 
</p>
<p>44. <i>Supports</i> the fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as 
established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007, and 
takes note with appreciation of the work conducted by the Special Rapporteur in the 
fulfilment of the mandate; 
</p>
<p>45. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, as part of the mandate, to continue to 
monitor the evolution of the world food crisis and, in the context of the mandate and regular 
reports, to keep the Human Rights Council informed of the impact of the crisis on the 
enjoyment of the right to food and to alert it to possible further actions in this regard; 
</p>
<p>46. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to continue to provide all the human and financial resources necessary 
for the continuation of the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p>47. <i>Welcomes</i> the continued cooperation of the High Commissioner, the 
Advisory Committee and the Special Rapporteur, and encourages them to continue their 
cooperation; 
</p>
<p>48. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
Rapporteur in his or her task by supplying all necessary information requested by the 
mandate holder and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests 
of the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries to enable him or her to fulfil his or her 
mandate more effectively; 
</p>
<p>49. <i>Recalls</i> the requests made by the General Assembly in its resolution 68/177 
of 18 December 2013 that the Special Rapporteur submit to the Assembly an interim report 
at its sixty-ninth session on the implementation of that resolution, and to continue his work, 
including by examining the emerging issues with regard to the realization of the right to 
food within the existing mandate; 
</p>
<p>50. <i>Invites</i> Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental 
organizations, as well as the private sector, to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur 
in the fulfilment of his or her mandate through, inter alia, the submission of comments and 
suggestions on ways and means of realizing the right to food; 
</p>
<p>51. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of 
the present resolution to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session; 
</p>
<p>52. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of this matter under the same agenda item 
at its twenty-eighth session.
