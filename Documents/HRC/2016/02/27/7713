<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
undertook an official visit to Indonesia from 31 May to 11 June 2013. The main purpose of 
the mission was to assess the policies and programmes aimed at promoting, on the basis of 
the principle of non-discrimination, the right to adequate housing in Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>2. In addition to Jakarta, the Special Rapporteur visited Makassar, Surabaya and 
Yogyakarta. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with officials and representatives 
of national and local Government, the judiciary, national human rights institutions, 
international organizations, donor agencies, the private finance and construction sectors, as 
well as non-governmental and grassroots organizations. She also met with communities and 
individuals in urban and rural areas, and heard their concerns with regard to housing issues 
in Indonesia.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to the Government of Indonesia for 
the invitation, the warm welcome, constructive dialogue and openness, its support and 
provision of relevant information throughout and after the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General overview 
</b>4. In the last decade, Indonesia has enjoyed steady economic growth and demonstrated 
substantial gains in social indicators, with gradual declines in poverty in both urban and 
rural areas, and is now classified as a middle-income country.1 Despite these impressive 
achievements, about 28.6 million people or 11.6 per cent of all households still live below 
the national poverty line set at US$ 1.25 per day.2 In addition, a significant part of the 
population (38 per cent) lives below 1.5 times the poverty line and is extremely vulnerable 
to falling into poverty.3 
</p>
<p>5. Indonesia is the world&#8217;s third most populous country and currently has the largest 
share and the fastest rate of growth of urban population in Asia.4 The number of urban poor 
is expected to rise as the country&#8217;s urbanization rate is projected to increase from its current 
level of 50 per cent to a projected 70 per cent by 2030.5 
</p><p>6. The urban poor are concentrated in highly urbanized and densely populated Java, 
accounting for more than two thirds of the country&#8217;s low-income population.6 Internal 
migration from rural to urban areas is partly caused by the concentration of economic 
activity in urban centres. Additionally commercial agriculture development and extractive 
industries in rural areas compete with traditional economic activities for land and natural 
resources pushing people to migrant to the cities. Although economic decentralization is 
part of the Government&#8217;s general development agenda, the inertia of the historical

<p>concentration of economic opportunities in Java7 is still challenging its housing policies &#8211; 
the improvement and upgrading of existing housing conditions, and the provision of 
adequate housing opportunities for future growth.8 The high and fast demographic and 
economic concentration across Java and on Bali, especially in the country&#8217;s two largest 
metropolitan regions, Jakarta and Surabaya, pose a number of difficulties, including 
congestion, overcrowding, inadequate provision of affordable land, inadequate 
transportation systems and a massive infrastructure backlog.  
</p>
<p>7. The combination of rapid urbanization, population density and high poverty rates 
poses serious challenges to the realization of the right to adequate housing for all in 
Indonesia. These challenges are compounded by the fact that the majority of Indonesia&#8217;s 
territory is highly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, particularly flooding, 
volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to adequate housing: legal and institutional 
framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. As a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,9 
Indonesia has the obligation to ensure the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing, while 
ensuring non-discrimination on any grounds. The right to adequate housing should not be 
interpreted in a restrictive sense such as merely having a roof over one&#8217;s head; it includes 
guaranteeing (a) legal security of tenure; (b) availability of services, materials, facilities and 
infrastructure; (c) affordability; (d) habitability; (e) accessibility; (f) location; and (g) 
cultural adequacy.  
</p>
<p>9. Indonesia&#8217;s Constitution and additional legislation guarantee the right to adequate 
housing as defined by international human rights law.10 The Government of Indonesia has 
also reiterated its commitment to the progressive realization of the right to adequate 
housing and to address discrimination in access to housing in the National Long-Term 
Development Plan 2005&#8211;2025 (RPJPN) and the National Medium-Term Development Plan 
(2010&#8211;2014) (RPJMN), particularly with regard to low-income households.11  
</p><p>10. The responsibility for housing policies and programmes is mainly shared between 
the Ministry of Public Housing and the Ministry of Public Works. The National Planning 
Agency (BAPPENAS) is responsible for the coordination of housing policies and for their 
compatibility with the National Development Plans. In addition, following the 
decentralization process (which began in the 1990s and is still underway), significant 
powers, including regarding land management, were partially devolved to the provinces,

<p>districts and municipalities of Indonesia.12 Each province, regency or city is responsible for 
its own development planning, as well as its implementation and monitoring. However, a 
highly complex mix of a hierarchal and top-down system of development and spatial 
planning exists, with the central Government retaining the authority to override local spatial 
plans for special areas, when deemed strategic and of national importance.13  
</p>
<p>11. The decentralization of planning and land administration does not seem to be 
supported by an enhanced institutional capacity in the regions in terms of the quality of 
human resources, organizational tools and financial capacity. On the fiscal side, most of the 
local governments are highly dependent on transfers from the central Government. The 
tight fiscal situation leaves little room to initiate programmes for development. 
Additionally, inter-institutional coordination, both at the central and local levels, is still a 
challenge. The Government has made efforts by establishing the National Board on Policies 
and Monitoring of the Construction of Housing and Settlement (BKP4N), but in practice 
the agency has not had all the instruments required to coordinate different bodies and 
sectors.14 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Current housing situation and policies 
</b>12. According to article 2(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, Indonesia has an obligation to make the maximum use of its available 
resources for the progressive realization of the right to adequate housing. Although the 
Government of Indonesia increased its budget allocation to the housing sector by over 60 
per cent between 2010 and 2013, the overall budget allocated to housing, infrastructure and 
development has remained only about 1.8 per cent of the national budget in the last four 
years.15 According to official estimates, 7.9 million housing units are considered of 
substandard conditions (with two of the three basic structures &#8211; wall, floor, and roof &#8211; in 
need of repair).16 
13. Infrastructure has also not kept up with rapid urbanization, particularly in informal 
settlements. For example, in 2009, the proportion of households with sustainable access to 
an improved water source in urban areas was 47 per cent, showing little improvement since 
2000. The proportion of households with sustainable access to improved sanitation was 
55.6 per cent in 2011 (compared to 32 per cent in 2000).17 Data of the National Land 
Agency (<i>Badan Pertanahan Nasional</i> (BPN)) shows that more than 3 million households 
do not have access to water and sanitation.18   
</p>
<p>14. Indonesia is currently in the midst of a housing affordability crisis, as recognized by 
the Government. The high urban population growth, the shortage of land for housing and 
urbanized land, and the sharply increasing housing and land prices are limiting the 
availability of affordable housing, particularly for low- and middle-income households in

<p>urban areas and has led to rapid expansion of informal settlements.19 Less than 8 per cent of 
the housing produced by the housing market costs less than Rp 400 million (US$ 40,000). 
With around US$ 4,000&#8211;6,000 per year as average income per capita of the urban 
population, the majority simply cannot afford to buy a house from the market.20<b> 
</b>15. Historically, the Government of Indonesia has not invested in public housing21 and 
until very recently has dealt with the limited capacity to provide affordable adequate 
housing by enabling self-help housing and the growth of informal settlement and investing 
selectively in slum upgrading. More recently, though, Governmental housing policies have 
been concentrating on the development of housing markets and housing financing systems.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Self-help housing and slum upgrading 
</b></p>
<p>16. According to official estimates, 80 per cent of housing development in Indonesia has 
been constructed through informal self-help systems of housing provision.22 The extent of 
areas officially classified as &#8220;slums&#8221; was estimated at 59,000 hectares in 2011 (23 per cent 
of the urban population living in slum areas in 2009)23 and is projected to reach 71,860 
hectares by 2025 at an annual growth of 1.37 per cent.24 Historically, the &#8220;self-regulated&#8221; 
informal housing has helped the State to externalize the cost of providing low-cost housing 
for the poor.25 
</p>
<p>17. An important part of these informal settlements is the urban <i>kampung</i> (village), an 
indigenous urban settlement mostly inhabited by lower middle class and poor people, a 
mixed-use highly densely populated area, for working and living.26 In general, <i>kampungs 
</i>are characterized by poor quality housing, lack of secure tenure, and lack of access to 
water, sanitation, drainage, and flood-control facilities, as well as by ambiguously defined 
legal status. However, housing conditions in the <i>kampungs </i>vary, as over time some have 
been connected to city facilities such as piped water, roads and drainage systems. With 
limited Government service provision, residents often access basic services through self-

 During the first quarter of 2013, house prices rose by 25 per cent compared with the same period in 
</p>
<p>2012. In Jabodetabek, only 8 per cent of the housing stock is targeted toward lower-income 
households (with the average price of Rp 400 million per unit) and only 15 per cent to lower-middle-
income (compared to 28 per cent to the upper-middle-income segment between Rp 1.4 billion and Rp 
2 billion per unit). (Data provided by property consultant Cushman &amp; Wakefield Indonesia, Kompas,

 On a limited scale, the Indonesian Government has provided public housing through Perum 
</p>
<p>Perumnas, a public real estate company. However, due to various limitations, from 1974 to 2004, 
Perumnas could only develop 453,000 houses and a substantive portion of its land was left vacant.

<p>produced connections or unregulated intermediary service providers, to whom they 
typically pay higher fees for lower quality services.27 
</p>
<p>18. During her mission the Special Rapporteur visited several <i>kampungs</i> in Jakarta, 
Makassar, Surabaya and Yogyakarta, and was deeply impressed by the strength of the 
community life in these &#8220;urban villages&#8221;. <i>Kampungs</i> are an intrinsic part of urban history 
and have been essential to providing low-income housing and contributing to economic 
development of the city through labour and consumption, and to the cultural and social 
fabric of Indonesian society.28  
</p>
<p>19. Although the administrative and legal insertion of these settlements vary from city to 
city, as some are recognized in city plans and others are not, one portion of them is 
consensually classified by the State as &#8220;illegal&#8221;. These are the <i>kampungs </i>that are located 
along riverbanks, canals, railways, green paths and parks, often in flood&#8211;prone zones, in 
contradiction to local and national spatial plans, rendering them completely &#8220;invisible&#8221; in 
city plans, &#8220;illegal&#8221; and vulnerable to evictions as well as natural hazards, such as floods 
and earthquakes.29 All levels of Government refrain from implementing housing policies 
and programmes in these settlements and rarely invest in facilities and infrastructure. As a 
result, living conditions in these settlements are worse than in other types of <i>kampungs</i>. 
These settlements clearly house the poorest among the urban poor, including internal 
migrants without identification cards.30 
</p>
<p>20. At the national level, the only official policy towards these settlements is eviction, in 
some cases followed by relocation to low-cost rental apartments (<i>Rusunuwa</i> &#8211; see section 
on affordable housing).31 However, there is some ambiguity and tolerance in practice, given 
the limited capacity of local Government to provide alternatives. As a result, these 
settlements tend to be evicted when a development project buys the land and the local 
Government is called to facilitate the project. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur 
visited several informal settlements located along river banks in Surabaya (Stren Kali) and 
Yogyakarta (along the Code River), that have been upgraded by the residents to conform 
with spatial planning and environmental requirements. These are good examples of 
inclusive development and the Special Rapporteur calls on the local and national 
Government to learn from these models in other locations, ensuring the security of tenure of 
the residents of these settlements. 
</p>
<p>21. Indonesia has a long history of slum improvement programmes, dating back to the 
1960s. The Kampung Improvement Program (KIP), which started in 1969 in Jakarta, is 
considered one of the most important and successful slum upgrading projects in the world. 
However, in recent years, relatively few other programmes and resources have been 
directed at slum improvement and, if so, they have been of a more limited scale.  
</p>
<p>22. Some of the more recent programmes include (a) the Support for Self-help Housing 
Stimulus (<i>Bantuan Stimulan Perumahan Swadaya</i> (BSPS)), (focusing on housing 
rehabilitation, operated by the Ministry of Public Housing); (b) the Neighbourhood 
Upgrading and Shelter Sector Project (NUSSP),32 that was implemented from 2005 to 2010

<p>in 32 cities by the Ministry of Public Works and focused on both infrastructure and 
housing, funded by the Asian Development Bank); and (c) the National Programme for 
Community Empowerment Urban (<i>Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat 
PErkotaan</i> (PNPM) Urban) (financial and technically supported by the Word Bank).33 All 
these programmes involve allocation of small grants to communities, the cooperation of 
central and local Government, the communities themselves and in some cases public&#8211;
private partnerships.34 
</p>
<p>23. The PNPM Urban Program, which has been operating in all urban areas of Indonesia 
since 1999, is currently the largest slum upgrading programme. PNPM-Urban is designed 
on the premise that &#8211; while many urban issues require larger infrastructure solutions (urban 
public transport, utility-supplied water, piped sewerage and storm drainage, urban roads) &#8211; 
community-level infrastructure will better respond to needs and cost less when it is planned 
and constructed by communities themselves. Its focus is on empowering communities to 
make decisions about their investment&#8217;s needs and priorities.35 
</p>
<p>24. Although these programmes have improved housing habitability, cost-effectiveness 
and empowerment of low-income communities, they have not been sufficiently linked to 
local and regional development and spatial planning. Improving road or drainage networks 
or the provision of utilities across the country cannot be effectively planned and 
implemented at the community level. Areas that are at particularly high risk to climate and 
natural hazards may require complex infrastructure planning or resettlement decisions 
which are beyond the scope of the community.36 As mentioned, these programmes are not 
implemented in informal settlements that are located on land which is not designated for 
habitation, excluding a large number of settlements where housing and infrastructure needs 
tend to be greatest.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by the fragmentation of programmes between 
various agencies and the inefficiency of existing coordination mechanisms. She 
recommends that the Government reinstate a national comprehensive and holistic slum 
upgrading programme, adequately funded, monitored and coordinated with spatial and 
development planning.

<p>26. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, as urban land becomes scarce and urban 
land prices skyrocket (particularly in Jabodetabek), the inner city <i>kampungs </i>face the threat 
of powerful economic and development forces. Retail and commercial buildings surround 
<i>kampungs</i>, but municipalities rarely include or prioritize the <i>kampungs </i>in their development 
plans. Labelling <i>kampungs</i> as &#8220;slums&#8221; can lead to misconceptions and reflects a 
misunderstanding of their function in Indonesian city fabric.37 This terminology increases 
the insecurity and ambiguity of the settlements, opening ground not only to development-
based evictions but also increasing their exposure to market pressures. It underlines the 
current predominant housing policy, which sees the <i>kampung</i> as a phenomenon to be 
eradicated (see next section).  
27. The Special Rapporteur calls on the national and local Government to ensure that 
<i>kampungs</i> are integrated into city planning and protected from market-induced

<p>displacements. The Government should also upgrade these k<i>ampungs</i> and service them 
with adequate infrastructure, facilities and services, including redevelopment when 
required. In cities such as Surabaya and in community-driven projects throughout the 
country (Tanah Tinggi in Jakarta and Stren Kali and Boezem Morokrembagan in 
Surabaya), the Special Rapporteur visited the implementation of alternatives in this 
direction, which prove that this is not only desirable but also feasible.  
</p>
<p>28. A strong degree of security of tenure is also needed to secure the existence of 
<i>kampungs</i>. In Jakarta, more than 50 per cent of the land parcels are unregistered with the 
Government and do not have title, leaving residents vulnerable to eviction.38 The Special 
Rapporteur met during her visit with communities that have invested efforts and resources 
in upgrading their <i>kampungs</i> but still do not have land certificates or other form of tenure 
security.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Affordable housing (<i>Rusunawa </i>and <i>Rusunami</i>) 
</b>29. In 2007 the Government of Indonesia launched the National Program for 1000 
Towers to increase adequate housing supply in metropolitan cities, in the form of low-cost 
rental walk-up flats (<i>Rusunawa</i>) and ownership in high-rise, low-cost apartments 
(<i>Rusunami</i>). Under this programme, the central Government provides tax incentives, ease 
of permits and infrastructure to reduce the development cost and subsequently the 
rent/purchase cost of the apartment, while the local Government provides the land for the 
project development.39 By 2011, all 1,000 towers were expected to have been built all over 
Indonesia.  
</p>
<p>30. Despite the initial substantive budgetary investment40 and the fact that all major real 
estate developers joined the programme, it soon became clear that developers had taken 
advantage of all the facilities from the State for <i>Rusunami</i> apartments (subsidy and 
location) to build middle-class condominiums instead of low-cost apartments. The 
opportunity to acquire scarce land within the city limits was probably the main driving 
force behind the developers&#8217; interest. In reality, only a few units were made available for 
low-income households and the rest were high-end apartments.41 
</p>
<p>31. The affordable rental housing, which supplies rental apartments at a subsidized low 
rent, (<i>Rusunawa</i>), is implemented by several Government agencies (including local 
Government, the Ministry of Public Housing and the State agency Perumnas), and has two 
target groups &#8211; informal settlers who were evicted and relocated, and Government 
employees or students.  
</p>
<p>32. To date, this programme has been implemented on a relatively small scale (between 
2010 and 2013 &#8211; 435 twin towers with 14,185 units were built by the Ministry of Public 
Housing in the country, and the numbers built by other national or provincial agencies are 
also modest). The limited scale is especially relevant considering that in Jakarta alone one

<p>of the target groups for these apartments (families to be relocated from river banks) 
amounts to tens of thousands of people (according to information provided to the Special 
Rapporteur during the mission, approximately 34,000 people residing along the Ciliwung 
River within the Jakarta province are to be relocated to these apartments) while there are 
only 5,600 units of low-cost rental apartments in the greater Jakarta area (some of them 
already occupied).  
33. Additional challenges related to <i>Rusunawa </i>deserve attention. One relates to the 
difficulties in providing maintenance for these apartment blocks. Subsidized rental schemes 
can only succeed in the long term when Governmental budgeting is available to also 
subsidize maintenance of the public spaces and facilities in these buildings, since low-
income tenants cannot afford these high costs.42 Of concern is the non-transparent selection 
of beneficiaries and the fact that apartments are available only for persons carrying Jakarta 
identification cards (city residency cards).43 However, the most crucial issue with regard to 
the <i>Rusunawa</i> programme is the location. According to information received from various 
sources, and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s own impression during the visit, there is currently a 
long waiting list for apartment towers which are located in good locations (close to 
employment opportunities and public services and &#8211; in the case of relocated communities &#8211; 
close to the original habitation site) coupled with low occupancy rates for buildings which 
are located in remote areas. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that 
relocation sites are located as near as possible to the original habitation sites. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Housing finance for homeownership 
</b></p>
<p>34. The most worrisome aspect of housing policy is that slum upgrading and affordable 
housing schemes such as <i>Rusunawa</i> are currently being sidelined in terms of budget 
allocation while funding increased for programmes to improve access to financing for 
middle-income households to access homeownership. According to the Ministry of 
National Development Planning, the largest current investment in the housing sector is tax 
subsidies for developers and down payment and interest subsidies for buyers (Facility of 
Liquidity for Housing Finance Program (<i>Fasilitas Likuiditas Pembiayaan Perumahan</i> 
(FLPP), 2010). According to the FLPP programme, banks receive long-term funding with 
very low interest rate (0.5 per cent) from the Government, which is then blended with 
commercial rate funding (at a 70:30 per cent ratio). The programme is to benefit first 
homebuyers with a maximum monthly income of Pr 3.5 million (for houses) and Pr 5.5 
million (for apartments) and a tax payer identification (NPWP).44 Beneficiaries will receive 
a subsidized mortgage with a fixed interest rate of 7.25 per cent for 20 years.45 
</p>
<p>35. According to the Mid-Term National Development Plan 2010-2014, 1,350,000 units 
were projected for FLPP, while only 380 twin block were projected to <i>Rusunawa</i>.46 By May 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42
 Although some local Governments (e.g. Surabaya) are subsidizing the maintenance, until recently, 
</p>
<p>this was not a national policy. Since 2012, the Ministry of Public Housing established a <i>Rusunawa</i> 
maintenance programme, which to date has been implemented on approximately 150 twin block 
towers.

<p>2013, 211,102 units were completed through the FLPP programme at a cost of 
approximately Pr 8,000 billion. In comparison, the budget allocated by the Ministry of 
Public Housing to slum upgrading for the same period was Pr 1 billion (655 hectares) and 
by the Ministry of Public Works Pr 971 billion while the overall estimate of slum area is 
around 60,000 hectares nationwide).47 
</p><p>36. According to BPN, 91 per cent of the Indonesian population is categorized as low-
income with limited procuring power;48 however, the FLPP clearly targets only those with a 
relatively stable income, working in the formal market. The policy excludes the self-
employed workers in the informal sector (60 per cent of the work force) and workers with 
unstable incomes that could not constitute marketable mortgage-backed securities. In other 
words, the policy targets the top 9 per cent of the population. Of additional concern is the 
fact that low-income households and informal workers, while excluded from the FLPP, are 
nonetheless negatively affected by its effects &#8211; the increase in demand for land and housing, 
and the escalating land and housing prices.49 
</p>
<p>37. The FLPP has already encountered implementation difficulties, and by 2012 only 
280,555 units were completed through this programme, illustrating its incompatibility with 
the needs of the majority of the population.50 The programme has also encountered 
difficulties from the supply side, with developers complaining about the scarcity of urban 
land, difficulties in acquiring building permits and lacking the cooperation of local 
Government in providing infrastructure for these projects.51 
</p>
<p><b> V. Development and planning regulations  
</b></p>
<p>38. As previously indicated, the limited availability of urbanized land is one of the main 
constraints on the housing sector in Indonesia, affecting the availability and affordability of 
housing for the poorest segments of the society. The situation has become more severe in 
the last 15 years, as private developers dominate urban development. Recently, real estate 
became a top commodity traded in the stock exchange market.52 The commercialization of 
urban land is widespread, followed by uncontrolled land speculation and monopolization 
which contributes to skyrocketing prices, particularly in urban centres, reducing land 
affordability for lower-income households.53 Most houses produced by real estate 
corporations are targeted for financial investments by the upper 10 per cent of urban 
population. A study by the Center of Metropolitan of Tarumanagara University reports that 
in Jabodetabek in the last decade, more than 30 large-scale real estate projects, occupying 
more than 30,000 hectares of land, had accommodated only 7 per cent of the total 
population growth of the period (approximately 10 million).54

<p>39. In response, the Government has put in place several development regulations55 to 
promote adequate distribution of land development to low-income groups, such as the so-
called &#8220;1:2:3 policy&#8221; (mandating that each development project maintains a proportion of 
one high-income unit, two middle-income units and three low-income units) and that 25 per 
cent of the development provides for modest homes.56 
</p>
<p>40. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed both by Government officials and 
civil society organizations that these regulations are not implemented by developers and 
there is no effective monitoring and enforcement. She was encouraged to hear that the 
Ministry of Public Housing and the Governor of Jakarta are considering new measures to 
strengthen the enforcement of these regulations.57 
</p>
<p>41. Even though a limited portion of State land is still available in cities, recent 
initiatives, such as the selling of Indonesia State railroad company land stock, has provoked 
not only evictions but also the use of public land for commercial purposes. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that available State land is allocated to low-
income housing, either to support new housing alternatives for the poor or to recognize 
existing settlements and thus provide them with security of tenure and improved living 
conditions.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Security of tenure and land issues 
</b>42. A complex, unresolved, inequitable and exclusionary land tenure system exists in 
Indonesia, exemplified by the fact that approximately 69 per cent of the land is owned by 
16 per cent of the population.58 
</p>
<p>43. Indonesia&#8217;s land legislation is based on colonial norms and practices, over which 
post-colonial reforms have been imposed. All land in Indonesia falls into one of two 
categories, forest estate (about 70 per cent of the land) and non-forest estate (the remaining 
30 per cent). Forest estate is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Forestry, regulated 
by the Basic Forest Law of 1967. Non-forest estate is managed and administered by BPN, 
according to the Basic Agrarian Law of 1960. As such, land is administered under a dual 
system through two different Government agencies responsible for forestry and non-
forestry lands, respectively. This dual system, together with colonial legacies and lack of 
integration of customary rights, have all generated numerous challenges, including 
widespread tenure insecurity, limited recognition of the customary rights of individuals and 
communities, and the unsustainable management of natural resources.59

<p>44. The Basic Agrarian Law recognizes private ownership and vests control of all 
unregistered land to the State, which holds title to all land in Indonesia.60 According to 
BPN, only 30 per cent of non-forest land is formally titled,61 leaving an estimated 60 
million land parcels unregistered. In recent years, BPN has registered an average of roughly 
1 million parcels per year. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. An individual&#8217;s claim of ownership of a land parcel may be informally registered 
with <i>kelurahan</i> offices. This kind of land right claim can be registered with BPN, but has 
no legal validity in itself. The difference between formally registered land (with BPN) and 
informally registered land (with the <i>kelurahan</i>) has significant symbolic and material 
consequences. As previously mentioned, <i>kampong</i> lands are virtually all unregistered, while 
those of the formal sector &#8211; exclusive neighbourhoods of developers&#8217; built housing &#8211; make 
up the bulk of the registered residential parcels.62 
</p>
<p>46. Since 2006, the Government has in place a programme &#8211; the People&#8217;s Service for 
Land Certificate (<i>Layanan Rakyat untuk Sertifikat Tanah</i> (LARASITA)) &#8211; to certify land 
for low-income populations and people living in remote and rural areas, which includes 
mobile registration services.63 The Government has also allocated budgetary resources for 
the National Agrarian Operation Project (<i>Proyek Operasi Agraria Nasional</i> (PRONA)), to 
facilitate massive land certification and registration, mainly for low-income households.64 
Land certification under PRONA is free of charge; however, some additional costs incurred 
for the completion of complex registration requirements and proceedings, as well as limited 
information on the proper certification procedures, still exclude large portions of 
Indonesia&#8217;s population from the registration system. This is exacerbated by limited 
information on zoning plans and regulations, which result in deviations, precluding the 
possibility of official registration and increasing the risk of evictions.65 Indonesia ranks 
107th out of 177 countries analysed with regard to the difficulty of registering private 
transactions, and the cost in Indonesia averages 10.7 per cent of the value of the property, 
which is three times the average cost in the region.66 
</p>
<p>47. The overall tenure insecurity is compounded by the parallel sets of customary <i>adat</i> 
laws67 and State law in Indonesia, causing confusion, land conflicts, problems for <i>adat 
</i>communities, evictions and forest destruction. Neither the Basic Agrarian Law nor the 
Basic Forestry Law provide adequate recognition to customary land practices or allow for 
registration of collective tenure.  
</p>
<p>48. Although article 56 of the Basic Agrarian Law (BAL) recognizes the continuing 
validity of rights derived from <i>adat</i>, or customary law, the right-holder cannot register the 
right or have it fully recognized by the State until he or she purchases a certification from 
BPN confirming that the land is not State land. <i>Adat</i> land can only be registered and 
certified after having been rendered into one of seven private law land rights recognized in

 <i>Adat</i>, customary land law, governs Indonesia&#8217;s traditional communal land tenure system and rights. It 
</p>
<p>varies widely across the archipelago.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/54/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>article 16 of the BAL. Thus, although in many cases the land right originates in <i>adat</i> law 
since well before the creation of the Indonesian State in 1945, BPN officials impose a 
presumption that all unregistered land is State land until proven otherwise. Moreover, <i>Hak 
ulayat </i>(which can be translated as &#8220;a communal right of allocation&#8221;) cannot be registered.68 
This deters communities from applying collectively for land certificates.69 
</p>
<p>49. The 1967 Basic Forestry Law and the 1967 Law on Mining essentially rendered all 
forest land the property of the State and eliminated the <i>adat</i> rights of communities living in 
these areas, depicting them as illegal &#8220;squatters&#8221;.70 However, according to the Ministry of 
Forestry, only 14 per cent of forest lands have been legally defined (gazetted), which 
further creates tenure insecurity. Confusion and disagreement over forest land and its use 
have led to uncertainty over which entity owns or controls the forests. Unrecognized private 
rights, including <i>adat </i>communal land, within the forest estate continue to create conflicts, 
since there about 33,000 villages (approximately 48 million people) located within or 
around the forest estate that have been living there for generations, even centuries, but their 
claims to the land are not recognized by the State.71 
</p>
<p>50. Conversion of land uses has had significant impact on natural resources and land 
rights of forest-dependent communities. Between 2004 and 2009, the Forestry Ministry 
allocated 1.2 million hectares of forests for mining activities, and plans to allocate a further 
2.2 million hectares of forests between 2010 and 2020. Palm oil production is also a main 
factor in changes in forest land uses, as Indonesia now controls 14.3 per cent of the world&#8217;s 
vegetable oil market. It is estimated that the establishment of 66 per cent of all currently 
productive oil-palm plantations involved forest conversion.72 
</p>
<p>51. Due to the decentralization process, district and municipal Governments now 
manage land, determine resource use and spatial planning, and manage revenues and 
budgets.73 The Special Rapporteur was informed that in many cases developers acquire 
permits for plantation, mining or development activities from local Governments, without 
prior knowledge of the residents actually living on the land and sometimes in contradiction 
to spatial plan or zoning regulations.74 Indonesia has witnessed nearly 2,000 cases of 
conflicts which involved 600,000 households regarding 10 million hectares of forest land.75 
</p>
<p>52. In this context, the Special Rapporteur welcomes recent decisions of the 
Constitutional Court recognizing customary rights over forest land and coastal area to 
communities traditionally living there, and calls on the Government to adjust legislation

<p>and policy in order to implement these decisions as soon as possible.76 She also calls 
attention to the Guidelines on large-scale land acquisitions and leases developed by the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food.77 The Government of Indonesia may find these 
guidelines useful when considering the revision of the 1967 Basic Forestry Law and the 
1967 Law on Mining.  
</p>
<p>53. Conflicts over land in both rural and urban areas are widespread in Indonesia and 
prevent registration and tenure security. According to one study, 65 per cent of 
administrative court cases involve land disputes.78 Land disputes cases are the number one 
category of complaints received by the National Commission on Human Rights (<i>Komnas 
Ham</i>)79, mostly related to public and private development activities resulting in involuntary 
resettlements, and the number is increasing. The Ministry of Law and Human Rights (two 
thirds of complaints) and the Ombudsman (one of the top five) also informed the Special 
Rapporteur during her visit that complaints on issues related to land are the most prevalent.  
</p>
<p>54. Indonesia lacks a complete inventory of reliably geo-referenced land parcels for both 
forest and non-forest lands. Additionally, there is no single authority in charge of resolving 
land disputes and both formal and informal arrangements are in place to address them. Four 
different institutions have overlapping competences: the civil court, the criminal court, the 
administrative courts, and a dispute settlement forum established by BPN to handle disputes 
relating to land misadministration and errors in land registration or titling. Litigation of land 
disputes is time-consuming and often prohibitively expensive for the poor, particularly in 
the absence of quality legal aid for low-income households and the absence of a transparent 
and accessible land information system.80 Large-scale land disputes are commonly resolved 
by political means because there is no civil process that is viewed as consistent or 
legitimate by the disputants. The inadequacy of the current system has prompted calls for 
the creation of a Land Court.81  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>55. The combination of fast development, a complex and exclusionary tenure system 
and the ambiguous presence of informal settlements in urban centres is causing widespread 
forced evictions and forced resettlement all over the country, in contradiction to 
international human rights obligations and standards. During her visit, the Special 
Rapporteur heard numerous testimonies of communities that have been forcibly evicted

<p>from rural or urban areas, by both private actors and various Government authorities. In her 
view, this is one of the most serious issues in Indonesia.  
</p>
<p>56. Forced evictions are a gross violation of a wide range of internationally recognized 
human rights.82 The term &#8220;forced eviction&#8221; refers to any eviction that is not carried out in 
accordance with international law and standards, regardless of whether the evicted persons 
hold legal title to the land and regardless of whether the eviction took place with the use of 
force. This is the case even when the eviction is to serve legitimate public interests, such as 
preventing risks.  
</p>
<p>57. Mass forced evictions may only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and 
in full accordance with international human rights law, which includes a number of strict 
conditions, such as (a) the obligation to provide full information on the purpose of the 
evictions; (b) legal remedies and legal aid to persons who are in need of seeking redress 
from courts; and (c) the taking of all appropriate measures to ensure adequate compensation 
and/or adequate alternative housing or resettlement. Evictions should not involve the use of 
force and should not result in individuals being rendered homeless. The solution should be 
reached by meaningful consultation with the affected communities to ensure that relocation 
results in the improvement of their standard of living or at least does not result in its 
deterioration.83 
</p>
<p>58. Despite these international standards, a myriad of national, provincial and municipal 
laws and regulations authorizes local Government to conduct evictions of settlements from 
privately owned land or from areas which are not intended for habitation according to the 
regional master plan.  
</p>
<p>59. Communities most vulnerable to evictions are those living in informal settlements on 
land that has been designated for public use (for example, green space, river banks, along 
rail tracks) and that have been occupying this land for years (in some cases more than 30 
years). Although these settlements are now branded as &#8220;illegal squatting&#8221;, this term is 
misleading, for the derogatory term obscures the fact that the occupation took place with 
permission and/or tolerance from the State, over decades.84 Most evictees or communities 
under continued threat of eviction that met with the Special Rapporteur considered that they 
had secured some form of tenure over the land from which they were evicted (or were 
under threat of eviction), after decades of occupation with no contestation (or 
encouragement) from public or private entities, and eventually receiving a variety of 
Government-provided services, as well as after years of paying land taxes.85 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur visited several &#8220;illegal&#8221; <i>kampungs</i> in Jakarta (Pluit 
Reservoir, communities living along the Ciliwung River, and the Duri Tambora 
community), in Surabaya (the Stren Kali river community) and in Yogyakarta 
(communities living along the river Code). In several cases (such as the settlement in Pluit 
reservoir and the Stren Kali community), the communities have been living there with the 
tacit agreement of the municipality or the authorization of State&#8211;owned companies. (Such is 
the case of the Duri Tambora community and the PT KAI railroad company.) The Special 
Rapporteur is alarmed with the plan to relocate 200,000 people living on the river banks

<p>and slum areas in Jakarta in the next five years, particularly as alternative, adequate and 
sustainable solutions of relocation or compensation are currently not available.  
</p>
<p>61. While Government policy with regard to &#8220;regularized&#8221; settlements with land 
certificates is to offer alternatives such as compensation, alternative land or housing or in 
situ upgrading, in the case of &#8220;illegal&#8221; slums, the Government refuses to consider 
compensation or in situ upgrading, and provides only relocation options to low-cost rental 
apartments in high-rise buildings (Rusanawa). It is the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; impression that 
this solution is unsustainable for several reasons. Firstly, as previously mentioned, the 
supply of low-cost rental apartments is extremely limited. Secondly, as witnessed by the 
Special Rapporteur during her visit, low-cost rental buildings are located far away from the 
evicted communities&#8217; original location and employment opportunities. 
</p>
<p>62. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies that in some instances 
evictees received no compensation at all. This is particularly the case for residents without 
identification cards or people living on land that is not designated for habitation &#8211; who are 
considered &#8220;illegal squatters&#8221;. In other instances, residents complained that the 
compensation offered was insufficient to find adequate or comparable alternative housing 
and to restore their livelihoods. As an alternative to monetary compensation, the State may 
provide appropriate and sufficient alternative accommodation or land, consistent with the 
needs of the affected community. 
</p>
<p>63. Recently, amendments have been promoted to clarify the legal framework of 
evictions and land acquisition. In January 2012, the Indonesian Parliament adopted Law 
No. 2 on Acquisition of Land for Development for Public Purposes and subsequently 
Presidential Regulation no. 71/2012 was adopted. The 2012 legislation revised the 
legislative framework underlying land acquisition, applicable to all land acquisition for 
public-interest projects that can be carried out by Government institutions after 7 August 
</p><p>2012. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the inclusion of urban slum planning, land 
consolidation and rental housing for low-income households under the definition of &#8220;public 
interest&#8221;.86 She also welcomes the mandatory consultation and participation procedure with 
affected communities and the broad definition of &#8220;affected communities&#8221; under article 15. 
She calls on both central and regional Government to guarantee access to full information 
on both development and acquisition plans to potentially affected communities in order to 
enable their meaningful consultation and participation in the development process. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, that the provisions about compensation and 
resettlement fall short of international human rights standards and obligations, as they 
exclude affected communities and individuals residing on State land in violation of spatial 
planning or zoning regulation.87 She is also concerned that unregistered right holders 
occupying land according to customary law may also be denied compensation in the 
absence of registered evidence.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Access to housing of vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>64. The obligation of non-discrimination is a fundamental principle of international 
human rights law, of immediate application. Article 2(2) of the Covenant of Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights obliges each State party &#8220;to guarantee that the rights enunciated 
in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status. Non-discrimination is an immediate and cross-cutting obligation under

 Article 40. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/54/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>the Covenant.88 States have an immediate obligation to adopt measures to eradicate 
discriminatory practices both in the public and in the private spheres. States&#8217; obligation to 
ensure the realization of the right to adequate housing extends to the obligation to protect 
individuals and communities from actions or omissions by third parties. During her visit, 
the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies and received information that some groups 
encounter discrimination in accessing adequate housing from both State and non-State 
actors. The following section will shortly address the situation of these groups.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Gender and sexual orientation 
</b></p>
<p>65. Although the 1974 Marriage Law stipulates that property purchased during marriage 
shall be co-owned by the spouse, women in Indonesia still face discriminatory practices 
with regard to property and inheritance rights based on customary and cultural practices in 
different regions. While women in Java are sometimes registered as co-owners, in other 
regions, such as Southeast Sulawesi and the islands of East Nusa Tenggara, women 
generally possess neither individual nor joint rights to land, deriving their rights through a 
husband or male relative.89 According to information provided by <i>Komnas Perempuan</i>, in a 
number of regions (such as Batak in North Sumatera, Bali, and Sasak and Flores in Nusa 
Tenggara), a married woman loses her access to inheritance rights and is disentitled of all 
assets following divorce. The Special Rapporteur met with women from Sumba region who 
offered testimonies of their difficulties in obtaining land certificates, despite the fact that 
they have been occupying the land for many years and have been regularly paying land 
taxes to local authorities.90 
</p>
<p>66. Even in regions where cultural practices favour women&#8217;s property rights, research 
indicates that very few titles are issued in the names of both husband and wife during 
registration. In Java, about 65 per cent of new titles are issued in the names of men, 30 per 
cent in the names of women, and only 5 per cent in the names of either husband and wife or 
siblings. Land rights are generally titled in the name of a woman only when the land is her 
separate property, while marital property is usually titled in the husband&#8217;s name. It appears 
that this is due to lack of information and awareness of both the public and registration 
officers about the option of joint registration.91 
</p><p>67. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women&#8217;s general recommendation No. 21 on equality in marriage 
and family relations which states that &#8220;the right to own, manage, enjoy and dispose of 
property is central to a woman&#8217;s right to enjoy financial independence, and in many 
countries will be critical to her ability to earn a livelihood and to provide adequate housing 
and nutrition for herself and for her family&#8221; (para. 26). 
68. The Special Rapporteur expresses her concern about the inadequate provision of 
shelter solutions to victims of domestic violence. In the last five years, the majority of cases 
reported are on domestic violence, especially violence against wives. In 2012 alone, 8,315 
cases of violence against wives were noted (66 per cent of reported cases). However, legal 
assistance and safety houses are still scarce and difficult for victims to access. Units

infrastructure.92 The Special Rapporteur recalls the observations of the Committee on the 
Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women in this regard and calls on the 
Government to ensure that adequate and secure shelter for women is available.93 
</p>
<p>69. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur also heard testimonies from lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals who have encountered discrimination in the 
private housing sector. She received reports of several cases of forced evictions of LGBT 
people by private landlords in various regions across Indonesia. She recalls that States have 
the obligation to protect against abuses of human rights by third parties, including 
discrimination and forced evictions, and to adopt the necessary measures to enable and 
assist individuals in enjoying their human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Internal migrants 
</b></p>
<p>70. Despite the fact that nearly one in every four urban residents has migrated from rural 
areas, many of them still do not have identity cards for their current residential location and 
do not receive any public services (such as education and health).94 Internal migrants are 
particularly vulnerable to the consequences of forced evictions. In the absence of 
identification cards, they are denied compensation or relocation. In many cases, the Special 
Rapporteur heard testimonies that the only solution offered to them is relocation back to 
their place of origin. However, such an option is not a sustainable solution, given the 
concentration of economic and employment opportunities &#8211; as well as services, education 
and health &#8211; in urban centres, particularly in Java.  
</p>
<p>71. While it might be common practice to establish minimum residency requirements for 
certain forms of State assistance, location-based identification or resident cards cannot 
constitute a form of <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> discrimination in accessing basic services and 
assistance, such as access to justice (against forced eviction) or due protection. Residents 
should be allowed to establish residency through other forms of proof, and allowed to 
access compensation, alternative housing and assistance where they have suffered harm or 
loss through eviction. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur is concerned with reports received about forced relocation of 
religious minorities (particularly Shi&#8217;a and Ahmadiyya communities) that have been 
instigated by mobs, and based on religious incitement.95 According to testimonies presented 
to the Special Rapporteur during her visit, homes, schools and places of worship have been 
burnt or destroyed in these attacks, forcing hundreds of families in different communities 
out of their homes into temporary shelters and accommodation without access to basic 
facilities, services and security. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur was informed about 130 people, including women and 
children, belonging to the Ahmadiyya community, who have been living in temporary

<p>accommodation in harsh conditions in Mataram, Lombok for more than seven years after 
being forced to flee their homes in Ketapang, West Lombok in February 2006. Their houses 
were destroyed by mobs, which attacked the community because of their religious beliefs. 
The forcibly evicted families have been unable to return to their homes and rebuild their 
lives.96 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of a Shi&#8217;a community (of 
about 168 people) from Karang Gayam village in the Sampang district on Madura island, 
who were forced to flee their homes in August 2012 when an anti-Shi&#8217;a mob of around 500 
people attacked the community, killing one person and injuring dozens and setting fire to 
their homes. They are currently residing in a temporary shelter in a sports complex on 
Madura island, Java. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that authorities have failed to adequately 
protect these communities from forced evictions and acts of violence. She calls on the 
Government to ensure that displaced communities have immediate access to essential 
services such as food, clean drinking water and health services, and to guarantee their safe 
return to their homes, providing them with the necessary assistance to rebuild their homes 
that were damaged or destroyed. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Post-disaster reconstruction 
</b></p>
<p>76. Indonesia has suffered several devastating natural disasters in the last decade, which 
have caused extensive loss of lives and severe destruction of housing and infrastructure of 
entire communities in various regions across the archipelago. From 2001 to 2010, there 
were 9,473 natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis and eruptions, and non-
natural disasters caused by human activities, such as floods, landslides and fires in cities 
and forests, several regions being hit by two or more natural disasters in less than five 
years.  
</p>
<p>77. Needless to say that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of communities affected by 
disasters pose an enormous challenge for the Government, both in technical and budgetary 
terms. The Special Rapporteur visited communities in Sleman (Yogyakarta province) that 
were affected by volcanic eruption, and was able to assess the Community-Based 
Settlement Rehabilitation Reconstruction Projects (REKOMPAK) that are being 
implemented in those regions.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress her positive impression with the design 
and implementation of the REKOMPAK programme, which should serve as a worldwide 
example of good practice in post-disaster reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes. 
From a human rights perspective, the programme is responsive, cost-effective, community-
driven, and appears to provide durable and sustainable solutions. The rehabilitation 
alternatives are tailored with the full participation of the affected communities, in 
accordance with the regional characteristics and culture. Of course, difficulties in 
implementation and sustainability of the programme persist, such as the right of 
communities to receive State support (both in terms of risk management and in situ 
rehabilitation), even in cases in which they refuse to relocate to a different site, or for rental 
tenants who were affected by the disaster. The flexibility of the programme can be used to 
address these complexities.

<p>79. This policy harnesses one of the major assets of this country &#8211; the strength of 
communities and the tradition of social cohesion and self-organization of communities. 
This asset could and should be mobilized in other national housing policies and in planning 
processes at all levels.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>80<b>. The coming years offer a window of opportunity for the Government of 
Indonesia to proactively manage the urbanization and development processes in order 
to ensure inclusive growth and poverty reduction and to rectify past distortions of the 
housing and land sectors. Legislation, policies and programmes, both at the national 
and regional levels, should encourage efficient urban spatial structures for all, 
sustainable land use planning, investments in critical infrastructure, strengthened 
tenure security and the provision of basic services including for those in informal 
settlements. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> To this end, the Special Rapporteur offered specific recommendations 
throughout the report. She also calls on the Government to consider the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National Housing Strategy 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) The Government should consider adopting a National Housing Strategy 
to be designed with effective public participation and based on updated, cross-cutting 
and disaggregated data on housing situation and needs. One of the main tasks of the 
Strategy should be to further clarify and facilitate the responsibility of and 
coordination between the various Government Ministries, provincial and local 
Governments and other stakeholders involved in the housing and land sectors, while 
finalizing the implementation of the decentralization process, and providing local 
Governments with the necessary resources to carry out their responsibilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The strategy should focus on the needs of those who face difficulties in 
accessing adequate housing through market mechanisms and promote a variety of 
tenure forms (including private and social rental), as well as homeownership; 
 (c) The strategy should be designed, implemented and monitored ensuring 
meaningful and ongoing participation of the population, as well as in housing and land 
policies and programmes, both at the national and local level, including budget 
allocation and spatial planning; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The strategy should offer the opportunity for the Government to renew 
its commitment to allocate adequate funds to a national holistic slum upgrading policy 
which should also include informal settlements on land not intended for habitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The strategy should include maintenance programmes to be 
implemented nation-wide in all <i>Rusunawa</i> complexes</b>;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Land management and administration  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Land policy should protect the interests of low-income households, 
indigenous communities and communities occupying land based on customary (<i>adat</i>) 
law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Government should ensure security of tenure &#8211; legal recognition of 
possession, communal land rights, forest land ownership. To this end, land regime 
should be revised so as to resolve ambiguities between customary (<i>adat</i>) and formal 
land laws; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/54/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Urban spatial plans and land use regulations should be designed to 
ensure an inclusionary and diversified urban environment and to recognize the 
<i>kampung</i> as an essential part of Indonesian urban fabric; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Land management policies should regulate markets to restrain 
speculation and monopolies and be adequately and efficiently enforced and 
implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) State land holdings should be reviewed and compared to existing and 
projected needs for land; consider allocating public land for low-income housing as 
well as recognizing the tenure rights of existing settlements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Existing regulations on land title and registration should be reformed in 
order to simplify the process, reduce the costs to individuals, permit collective and 
communal rights, provide flexible requirements on the forms of title evidence 
required, increase efficiency and diminish delays; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Effective mechanisms for the settlement of conflicts over land and the use 
and management of natural resources should be developed to make them accessible 
and affordable for low-income households; 
</b></p>
