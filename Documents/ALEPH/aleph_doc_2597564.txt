Preamble
The Company underwent significant Board and management changes during the 2015-2016 financial year. The Board 
of Directors has, as at 30 June 2016, no Committees established, however, had fully operational committees from July 
2015 to March 2016.
The Company published the following Committee Charters on the website:
1.  Remuneration and Nomination Committee Charter 
2.  Audit, Risk and Sustainability Committee Charter
The ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations recommend the establishment of an Audit and Risk 
Management Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee to assist the Board in the execution 
of its duties and allow detailed consideration of complex issues.
Given the current size and composition of the Company’s Board, the full Board is responsible for the duties of the 
Committees as detailed in the relevant charters. Committees will be re-formed if the Board grows further in size and 
considers the re-establishment to be appropriate. As at 30 June 2016 the Board consisted of three directors with one 
independent non-executive director and two non-executive shareholder representative directors.
The length of service and role of each Director on the Board during the 2015-2016 financial year was as follows

PRINCIPLE 1:  LAY SOLID FOUNDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT
Recommendation 1.1 - Functions of the Board and Senior Executives
The Board operates in accordance with broad principles set out in its Charter.  The full Board Charter, Committee 
Charters and Policies are available in the Corporate Governance section on the Company’s website 
(www.abmresources.com.au./corporate/corporate-governance).
The Board Charter sets out the specific responsibilities reserved for the Board and the Board’s delegation of 
responsibility to allow the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer and the executive management team to carry 
out the day-to-day operations and administration of the Company. The Board Charter supports all delegation of 
responsibilities by formally defining the specific functions reserved for the Board and its Committees, and those 
matters delegated to management.  Management is responsible for implementing the strategic objectives and 
operating within the risk range set by the Board.  Management is also responsible for providing the Board with 
accurate, timely and clear information to enable the Board to perform its responsibilities.  The Managing 
Director/Chief Executive Officer is accountable to the Board for the authority that is delegated by the Board.
Recommendation 1.2 – Appointment of New Directors
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee Charter provides that the Remuneration and Nomination Committee 
must undertake appropriate checks before a person is appointed to the Board, or put forward to shareholders as a 
candidate for election as a director.  The Board is responsible for ensuring that all material information in the 
Company’s possession relevant to a decision on whether or not to elect or re-elect a director is provided to 
shareholders.  This is done by making disclosures in the notice of meeting for general meetings at which directors are 
to be elected or re-elected.
As at 30 June 2016 the Board of the Company consisted of three non-executive directors and the duties of the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee were undertaken by the full Board (refer to preamble).
Recommendation 1.3 – Written agreements with each Director and Senior Executive
With the exception of Brett Lambert, all Directors and key executives reporting to the Managing Director/Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company have been given formal letters of appointment outlining key terms and conditions 
of their appointment.
Mr Lambert was appointed as Interim Chief Executive Officer on 16 October 2015 initially for a 4 months contract
which was subsequently extended to 7 months. Mr Lambert’s role changed to Managing Director on 8 March 2016
where the employment conditions were agreed and announced but a formal contract was not executed. On 8 May
2016 the role changed again to Chief Executive Officer and employment conditions were re-affirmed in a letter,
however a formal contract was not executed. Subsequent to year-end Mr Lambert resigned from his position.

is accountable directly to the Board (through the Chairman), on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the 
Board.
Recommendation 1.5 – Diversity Policy
The Company and all its related bodies are committed to workplace diversity and have adopted a Diversity Policy 
which is available in the Corporate Governance section on the Company’s website.
4.
The Company recognises the benefits arising from employee and Board diversity, including a broader pool of high 
quality employees, improving employee retention, accessing different perspectives and ideas and benefiting from all 
available talent. Diversity includes, but is not limited to, gender, age, ethnicity and cultural background.
The Chairman monitors the scope and currency of this policy.  The Board is responsible for developing the 
Measurable Objectives and strategies to meet the objectives of the Diversity Policy.  The Company is responsible for 
implementing, monitoring and reporting on the Measurable Objectives.  These Measurable Objectives include:
•
•
• 
•
considering all persons with appropriate experience and qualifications equally when new employees or 
directors are recruited (non-quantitative); 
considering all persons with appropriate experience and qualifications equally when considering them for 
promotion (non-quantitative); 
that there is to be at least one female director (achieved); and 
that there is to be at least one female in senior management (achieved).

performance assessment.

interest.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee , or if the board is not of an appropriate size the Board, is responsible 
for an annual performance review of the Board and compares the performance of the Board with the requirements of 
its Charter and critically reviews the mix of the Board. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee Charter and the 
Policy for the disclosure of Performance Evaluation of the Board, its Committees and its individual Directors can be 
found in the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.

Nomination Committee Charter.

Directors with the majority being independent. The Charter requires that the chair of the Committee be an

conduct in a variety of contexts and outlines the minimum standard of behaviour expected from management and
