SENTENCE

This was a truly shocking crime. A whole family was done away with. They met a horrible and brutal end after you had stabbed each one many many times.

You are sentenced on each count to life imprisonment, each sentence to be served concurrently. I recommend that you serve a minimum term on each of 17 years, as from today.
