Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Reports
Second Quarter 2013 Financial and Operating Results
    
    
Dallas, Texas, July 31, 2013 -- Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. (“Pioneer Southwest” or
“the Partnership”) (NYSE: PSE) today announced financial and operating results for the quarter
ended June 30, 2013.
Pioneer Southwest reported second quarter net income of $30 million, or $0.83 per common unit.
Net income for the second quarter included unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains of $9
million, or $0.26 per common unit. Without the effect of this item, adjusted income for the second
quarter was $21 million, or $0.57 per common unit. Cash flow from operations for the second
quarter was $31 million.
The Partnership's three-rig drilling program continued during the second quarter, with 13 new
wells being placed on production. Oil and gas sales for the second quarter averaged 8,412
barrels oil equivalent per day (BOEPD). At the end of the quarter, the Partnership had seven
wells awaiting completion. Production continues to benefit from deeper vertical drilling to the
Wolfcamp, Strawn and Atoka intervals. The Partnership has a large inventory of remaining oil
drilling locations in the Spraberry field, with approximately 135 40-acre vertical locations and
1,275 20-acre vertical locations.
Pioneer Southwest expects to drill approximately 50 vertical wells during 2013. Capital
expenditures are forecasted to be $120 million, including facilities. The 2013 drilling program is
expected to generate production growth of 9% compared to 2012. Essentially all of the wells will
be drilled to the Strawn formation, with approximately 85% of these wells drilled to the deeper
Atoka interval. In addition, recent successful horizontal Wolfcamp Shale drilling by industry
participants in Midland County and Martin County is encouraging for future horizontal drilling
potential on the Partnership's acreage in the area.
Second quarter oil sales averaged 5,627 barrels per day (BPD), natural gas liquids (NGL) sales
averaged 1,451 BPD and gas sales averaged 8 million cubic feet per day. The second quarter
average price for oil was $90.93 per barrel. The average price for NGLs was $31.25 per barrel,
and the average price for gas was $3.39 per thousand cubic feet.
Production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes) for the second quarter averaged
$23.86 per barrel oil equivalent (BOE). Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the
second quarter averaged $10.37 per BOE.
The Partnership has additional borrowing capacity under its credit facility of $100 million as of
June 30, 2013, which is expected to be adequate to fund 2013 planned vertical drilling activities.
The Partnership has also entered into derivative contracts that cover approximately 70% in 2013,
70% in 2014 and 10% in 2015 of its forecasted production.
Pioneer Southwest previously announced a cash distribution of $0.52 per outstanding common
unit for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. The distribution will be paid on August 9, 2013, to
unitholders of record at the close of business on August 2, 2013.
Third Quarter 2013 Financial Outlook
The following paragraphs provide the Partnership's third quarter of 2013 outlook for certain
operating and financial items.
Production is forecasted to average 8,200 BOEPD to 8,700 BOEPD. Production costs (including
production and ad valorem taxes) are expected to average $23.00 per BOE to $26.00 per BOE
based on current NYMEX strip prices for oil, NGLs and gas. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense is expected to average $10.00 per BOE to $11.00 per BOE. General and
administrative expense is expected to be $1.5 million to $2.5 million. Interest expense is
expected to be $1.0 million to $1.2 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations
is forecasted to be nominal.
Pioneer Southwest's effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 1% of earnings
before income taxes as a result of Pioneer Southwest being subject to the Texas Margin tax.
Common Unit Purchase Proposal from Pioneer Natural Resources Company
On May 7, 2013, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (“Pioneer”) delivered a proposal to the
chairman of the Conflicts Committee (the “Conflicts Committee”) of the General Partner of the
Partnership to acquire all of the outstanding common units of the Partnership held by unitholders
other than Pioneer or its subsidiaries for consideration of 0.2234 of a share of common stock of
Pioneer for each outstanding common unit of the Partnership held by such unitholders in a
transaction to be structured as a merger of the Partnership with a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Pioneer. The proposed 0.2234 exchange ratio was based on Pioneer's assumption that the
Partnership would declare and pay the aforementioned distribution for the quarter ending June
30, 2013, and then suspend future common unit distributions pending the execution of a
definitive agreement and the consummation of the transaction. The proposal was referred to the
Conflicts Committee, which is reviewing and evaluating the proposal. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by Pioneer's proposal is subject to approval of Pioneer's Board of
Directors, approval of the Conflicts Committee and the Board of Directors of the General Partner
and the negotiation of a definitive agreement. There can be no assurance that a definitive
agreement will be executed or that any transaction will be approved or consummated.
The Partnership will post a presentation related to its financial and operating results for the
quarter ended June 30, 2013, on the Partnership's website, www.pioneersouthwest.com. A copy
of the presentation can be reviewed at the website by selecting “Investors,” then “Investor
Presentations.”

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS PER UNIT INFORMATION
(in thousands, except for per unit amounts)
The Partnership follows the two-class method of calculating basic and diluted net income per
unit. Under the two-class method, generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") provide
that the net income applicable to the Partnership be allocated to all securities that participate in
the Partnership's earnings. Accordingly, net income applicable to the Partnership is allocated to
the General Partner, unvested participating securities and common unitholders. Net losses
applicable to the Partnership are allocated to the General Partner and common unitholders but
only to unvested participating securities to the extent that they receive distributions during loss
periods because unvested participating securities are not contractually obligated to share in the
Partnership's net losses. Unit- and unit-based awards with guaranteed dividend or distribution
participation rights qualify as "participating securities" during their vesting periods. The
Partnership's basic and diluted net income per unit attributable to common unitholders is
computed as (i) net income applicable to the Partnership, (ii) less General Partner net income,
(iii) less unvested participating securities' basic and diluted net income (iv) divided by weighted
average basic and diluted units outstanding.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Partnership's net income applicable to the
Partnership to basic and diluted net income attributable to common unitholders, and the
calculation of net income per common unit - basic and diluted, for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2013 and 2012:

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(in thousands)
EBITDAX and distributable cash flow (as defined below) are presented herein and reconciled to
the GAAP measures of net cash provided by operating activities and net income. Management of
the General Partner believes these financial measures provide additional information to the
investment community about the Partnership's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to sustain or
increase distributions to its unitholders, among other items. In particular, EBITDAX is used in the
Partnership's credit facility to determine the interest rate that the Partnership will pay on
outstanding borrowings and to determine compliance with the leverage coverage test. EBITDAX
and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net cash provided by
operating activities or net income, as defined by GAAP.

taxes.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(in millions, except per unit data)
Adjusted income excluding unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains, as presented in this
press release, is presented and reconciled to the Partnership’s net income determined in
accordance with GAAP because the Partnership believes that this non-GAAP financial measure
reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the Partnership’s business that, when viewed
together with its financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete
understanding of factors and trends affecting its historical financial performance and future
operating results, greater transparency of underlying trends and greater comparability of results
across periods. In addition, management believes that this non-GAAP measure may enhance
investors’ ability to assess the Partnership’s historical and future financial performance. This non-
GAAP financial measure is not intended to be a substitute for the comparable GAAP measure
and should be read only in conjunction with the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses will
recur in future periods; however, the amount can vary significantly from period to period. The
table below reconciles the Partnership’s net income for the three months ended June 30, 2013,
as determined in accordance with GAAP, to adjusted income excluding unrealized mark-to-
market derivative gains for that quarter.
