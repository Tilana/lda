<p>I. <b>INTRODUCTION 
 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report supplements the main report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers to the Human Rights Council. It reflects specific situations 
alleged to be affecting the independence of the judiciary or violating the right to a fair trial in 63 
countries. Further, it presents any replies received from the Government of the country 
concerned in response to specific allegations together with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments 
and observations. Readers will thus find in it: 
 
</p>
<p>(a) Summaries of the urgent appeals and allegation letters transmitted by the Special 
Rapporteur to governmental authorities between 1 January 2006 and 15 January 2007, and of 
press releases issued during the same reporting period. In this connection, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the communications presented in the report exclusively 
reflect allegations he received and subsequently acted upon. Where information was insufficient 
and could not be supplemented, or where the information received was outside the mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur was not in a position to act. Hence such allegations were not included in the 
report;  
 
</p>
<p>(b)  Summaries of the replies received from several States concerned between 
1 January 2006 and 15 January 2007. In certain instances, the Government reply was 
obtained late and referred to allegations that were presented in the previous report 
concerning the year 2005 or even earlier. On the other hand, it may be noted that certain 
responses to urgent appeals or allegation letters sent during the reporting period, and for 
which the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Governments, could not be included in 
the report owing to the fact that they were either not translated in time or received after 15 
January 2007. To the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s regret, they will therefore be reflected only in 
next year&#8217;s report. Finally, due to restrictions on the length of the report, the Special 
Rapporteur has been obliged to summarize the details of all correspondence sent and 
received. As a result, requests from Governments to publish their replies in their totality 
could regrettably not be accommodated; 
 
</p>
<p>(c)  Observations or specific comments by the Special Rapporteur. 
 
2. The report also includes six tables of statistical data so as to help the Human Rights Council 
to have an overview of developments in 2006 and the past three years. <b> 
</b> 
3. As may be seen from the tables, action has mainly been taken in the form of urgent action, 
and this in conjunction with other special rapporteurs. This reflects not only a personal choice of 
the Special Rapporteur to work in close collaboration with other special rapporteurs and aimed 
at strengthening the functioning and impact of  the special procedures, but also the fact that it is 
far from uncommon that situations affecting the judiciary occur in contexts in which other 
democratic institutions are also at risk, or where a wide range of human rights are being violated 
such as the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture and ill-treatment, the right to 
freedom of expression, as well as the specific rights of women, indigenous peoples or 
minorities. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 5 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur notes that communications have been sent to 63 Member States of 
all regions of the world. Furthermore, he highlights that the type of allegations covers a wide 
range of subjects. It should be noted, however, that over 40 per cent of the communication sent 
concern allegations related to threats against lawyers. In addition, about 11 per cent of 
communications have been sent with respect to alleged violations of the right to choose one&#8217;s 
own lawyer, and similarly, about 11 per cent on reported violations of the freedom of expression 
of lawyers. A significant percentage (about 10 per cent) concerned alleged violations of the right 
to have access to the courts and a fair trial.  
 
5. The Special Rapporteur points out that, as compared to 2005, the number of 
communications sent to Governments has increased by 67 per cent. Given this significant 
increase, fears are expressed with respect to the increasing percentage of wide-ranging assaults 
on the independence of judges and lawyers around the world. These facts do not only prove the 
weakening of the judiciary as an institution, but also reflect direct attacks on judges and lawyers, 
all of which result in significant violations of the right to due process and to a fair trial. The 
Special Rapporteur further attributes this increase to the fact that more people are aware of the 
procedure and the international standards guiding his mandate. However, the significant low 
percentage of female individuals on behalf of whom the Special Rapporteur was able to receive 
information and send communications is of serious concern to him. Hence, he is concerned 
about the lack of reporting on the situation of women and the resulting diminished protection of 
their human rights. 
 
6. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur wishes to point out that, as compared to previous 
years, he has enjoyed increased cooperation on the part of Governments. In fact, 34 States of the 
63 States referred to in this report have provided him with a substantive reply to his 
communications.  Most of these States have offered detailed substantive information on the 
allegations received. The Special Rapporteur welcomes and further encourages cooperation 
from the Governments that have provided replies to his communications. The Special 
Rapporteur underlines that it is crucial that Governments share their views on the allegations 
received with him. He highlights his preoccupation in relation to the proportion of specific 
allegations of serious human rights violations that remain unanswered. The Special Rapporteur 
invites those States which are lagging behind to avoid situations in which they do not offer any 
form of substantive reply to allegations transmitted to them. Fearing that such lack of reply may 
expose these States to various interpretations ranging from administrative negligence to an 
admission by omission of the allegation relayed to them, he urges them to provide precise and 
detailed answers at the earliest possible date. 
 
7. The Special Rapporteur trusts that the situation described above demonstrates the relevance 
of the existence and the concrete impact of this special procedure which, in his view, should 
definitely be strengthened in the course of the review of mandates by the Human Rights Council. 
The above also shows the value, need and relevance of technical assistance at the country level 
and the importance of strengthening international capacity in this area. In this connection, the 
Special Rapporteur highlights the relevance and urgency of better promoting at the national 
level United Nations guidelines regarding the judiciary. This should be done in a systematic and 
coherent manner in the context of legal education, including continued legal education, so as to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>improve the capacity of judges, lawyers and prosecutors to perform their functions with 
independence and to raise their human rights awareness.

III. SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
 
</b></p>
<p>9. On 20 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions regarding the trial of 
Asadullah Sarwari and the imposition of the death penalty against him. Mr. Sarwari, who is 
now aged 65, is said to have been the head of Afghanistan&#8217;s intelligence service (AGSA) 
under the regime of Hafizullah Amin (1978-1979), which carried out mass arrests and 
summarily executed many of those detained. According to the information received, Mr. 
Sarwari was arrested in 1992 by a mujahideen force following the withdrawal of the 
Armed Forces of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan. In 2003 he was handed over to the 
intelligence service of the Government, the National Security Directorate. In autumn 2005, 
Mr. Sarwari appealed to President Karzai &#8220;for justice&#8221;. Criminal proceedings against him 
were initiated and he was charged with several crimes against the internal security of the 
State, including encouraging an uprising of the Armed Forces, using force to overthrow the 
presidency and homicide. The trial consisted of three hearings, the first on 26 December 
2005, the last on 25 February 2006. Because of the highly charged atmosphere surrounding 
the trial and the precarious security situation, Mr. Sarwari was unable to find a suitable 
lawyer to represent him. Most of the evidence adduced at trial related to the arrest and 
subsequent disappearance of up to 70 members of the Mujeddadi family in June 1979. At 
the final trial hearing, on 25 February 2006, at Kabul National Security Primary Court, 16 
witnesses testified. Some were called by the prosecutor, while others &#8220;gave evidence&#8221; 
spontaneously from the public gallery. Members of the Mujeddadi family and household 
stated that the accused had been present at, and was in charge of the arrests. One witness 
gave evidence in support of Mr. Sarwari, stating that he had released 120 detainees in 1979. 
This produced an angry reaction from the public gallery. The presiding judge called the 
court to order and stated that it was important for the court to hear both sides. Mr. Sarwari 
was not given the opportunity to cross-examine any of the witnesses.  
</p>
<p> 
10. Mr. Sarwari denied all allegations against him. He complained about his illegal arrest 
and detention for more than 13 years without trial. He admitted to having issued arrest 
warrants, but challenged the prosecutor to produce any testimony or documentary proof 
that could prove his involvement in the killing of detainees. The prosecutor conceded the 
absence of any article in the Penal Code of Afghanistan under which Mr. Sarwari could be 
convicted as a war criminal, but argued that Mr. Sarwari&#8217;s official position as the Head of 
AGSA was sufficient to hold him responsible for the murder and disappearance of 
innocent Afghans under article 130 of the Constitution. At 1.30 p.m. the judicial panel 
retired to consider its verdict. Fifteen minutes later the judges returned and pronounced Mr. 
Sarwari guilty of &#8220;killing of countless Afghans&#8221; on the basis of his involvement in the 
arrest of members of the Mujeddadi family and of his senior official position in the Amin 
regime. He was not found guilty on any specific count contained in the indictment but 
rather, according to the judge, in accordance with article 130 of the Constitution which </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 11 
</p>
<p>states that &#8220;if there is no provision in the Constitution or other laws about a case, the courts 
shall in pursuance of Hanafi jurisprudence and within the limits set by the Constitution, 
rule in a way that attains justice in the best manner&#8221;. On the basis of this guilty verdict, he 
was sentenced to death. It would appear that the Attorney General has filed an appeal 
against the judgement (or the sentence), while Mr. Sarwari has not appealed against the 
judgement and sentence within the 20-day deadline provided by the Interim Criminal 
Procedure Code. <b> 
 
</b>11. The Special Rapporteurs commended the Government for bringing to justice a person 
accused of responsibility as a commander for numerous summary executions (although they  
expressed concern that the Afghan Criminal Code does not proscribe war crimes and crimes 
against humanity, and therefore does not allow the prosecution to file charges which fully 
reflect the seriousness of the crimes Mr. Sarwari is accused of &#8211; an issue which the problems 
related to the charges in the present trial would appear to highlight). Indeed, ending the 
impunity of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed 
during the 25 years of armed conflict in Afghanistan is an important obligation of the 
Government under international law and the Action Plan on Peace, Justice and 
Reconciliation. It also constitutes a demand of the Afghani people, as set forth in the Afghan 
Independent Human Rights Commission&#8217;s report <i>A Call for Justice. A National 
Consultation on Past Human Rights Violations in Afghanistan</i>. Such efforts to ensure 
accountability must, however, themselves comply with international human rights law. 
While capital punishment is not prohibited under international law, it must be regarded as 
an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and is circumscribed by strict 
limitations imposed by international law binding upon the Government, in particular 
articles 6 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). With 
specific regard to the case of Mr. Sarwari, attention was drawn to the requirement that &#8220;in 
capital punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the 
guarantees for a fair trial set out in article 14 of the [ICCPR] admits of no exception&#8221; (<i>Little 
v. Jamaica</i>, communication No. 283/1988, Views of the Human Rights Committee of 19 
November 1991, para. 10).  
</p>
<p> 
12. The reports concerning the trial of Mr. Sarwari raise a number of very serious concerns 
with regard to the right to a fair trial. Regarding the requirement of independence and 
impartiality of the tribunal (article 14(1) ICCPR), reports indicate that before the decisive 
hearing of 25 February 2006 representatives of the Mujeddadi family (i.e. victims and 
prosecution witnesses) and the Head of the Department of Judicial Inspections of the 
Supreme Court, Mr. Halimi, were sitting in the judges&#8217; chambers at the courthouse and 
meeting with the judge presiding over the trial. Mr. Halimi sat in the front row of the court 
throughout the hearing, next to prosecution witnesses and close to the prosecutor. At one 
point he intervened during the trial. When the judges retired to consider their verdict, he also 
left the court. Moreover, the judicial panel took only 15 minutes of deliberation to find the 
applicant guilty and sentence him to death. The Special Rapporteurs acknowledge that the 
presiding judge reportedly gave Mr. Sarwari the opportunity to speak unhindered in his 
defence and reminded the public that both sides must be given a full hearing. The 
circumstances referred to above, however, engender the impression of possibly undue 
influence over the trial judges by the Department of Judicial Inspections of the Supreme </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 12 
</p>
<p>Court and the victims&#8217; family and cast a grave shadow over the appearance of independence 
and impartiality of the tribunal. Regarding the accused&#8217;s right to be informed of the charges, 
to be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence, and to be enabled 
to examine the witnesses against him and obtain the attendance of witnesses on his behalf 
(article 14(3) (a), (b) and (e) ICCPR), nothing in the reports received indicates that the 
accused had prior notice of who would give evidence against him and what exactly the 
witnesses would give evidence on. Under articles 51 and 53 of the Interim Criminal 
Procedure Code the prosecution was obliged to submit to the court a list of witnesses it 
intended to call, which it failed to do. Mr. Sarwari therefore had no opportunity to call 
evidence in rebuttal, to effectively challenge the prosecution evidence or to properly 
prepare his defence. The accused was not given the opportunity to cross-examine the 
witnesses against him, and did not call any witnesses on his behalf. Finally, the accused was 
convicted on the basis of a provision, article 130 of the Constitution, that was not contained 
in the Criminal Code in force at the time of the trial, was not mentioned in the indictment 
and reportedly was not discussed in the course of the trial, which would appear to have 
seriously undermined his chances of effectively preparing his defence. Articles 57 and 42 of 
the Interim Criminal Procedure Code as well require prior notice to be given to the defence 
of changes in the definition of offences alleged. 
 
13. Regarding the accused&#8217;s right &#8220;to defend himself in person or through legal assistance 
of his own choosing &#8230; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the 
interests of justice so require&#8221; (article 14(3) (d) ICCPR), Mr. Sarwari did not enjoy any legal 
assistance. The reports received indicate that this was not his free choice, but due to the 
circumstance that no lawyer was willing to take up his defence. The Special Rapporteurs  
also expressed concern that in the indictment, Mr. Sarwari&#8217;s request for an attorney was 
viewed as disruptive of the prosecution&#8217;s investigation and as another basis for his guilt. 
Regarding the right to obtain review of conviction and sentence by a higher court (article 
14(5) ICCPR), the effective exercise of this right requires that the defendant be provided 
with legal counsel and time to adequately prepare his appeal. While not wishing to prejudge 
the accuracy of the reports received, in the event that they were accurate, entirely or also 
only in part, the Special Rapporteurs have no doubt that international law requires the 
Government to ensure that the death penalty is not carried out. They urged the Government 
to ensure that the concerns expressed with regard to the trial are fully taken into account at 
the second instance stage, whether or not Mr. Sarwari himself files an appeal against the 
judgement. They further urged the Government to ensure that Mr. Sarwari is provided with 
adequate legal assistance for all remaining procedural stages in his case. In 2003, the 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 2003/77 called on the Afghanistan 
Transitional Administration to &#8220;declare a moratorium on the death penalty in the light of 
procedural and substantive flaws in the Afghan judicial system.&#8221; The Commission 
recognized that the Government is undertaking considerable efforts to improve the criminal 
justice system under the most challenging circumstances. Nonetheless, the experts consider 
that the concerns highlighted with regard to the trial of Mr. Sarwari (as well as those set 
forth in their letter of 31 August 2005 concerning the cases of  Sharifullah (surname 
unknown), Habib al-Rahman, Zalmai (surname unknown), Neyaz Mohammad, Tila 
Mohammad (known as Telgai), Mohammad Rafiq, and Omar Khan, which unfortunately </p>

live up to its obligations under international law.  
 
<b>Press release  
</b> 
14. On 8 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY 
</p>
<p>CONDEMNS PUBLIC EXECUTION FOLLOWING ILLEGAL TRIAL IN 
AFGHANISTAN 
</p>
<p> 
<i>&#8220;</i>The following statement was issued today by Leandro Despouy, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers:  
 
&#8220;It has been reliably reported that the Taliban claim to have carried out a public 
execution of an alleged murderer following a trial by a local Taliban court, in Ququr 
village in the district headquarters town of Gizab in Daikundi. The UN expert on 
judicial independence, Leandro Despouy, today condemned these developments in 
very strong terms. The execution of Badshah Khan reportedly took place early last 
month in front of a large crowd. There is currently no effective central judicial and 
government authority in Gizab hence the community's reliance continues on 
traditional community leaders for resolution of conflicts. It has been reported that in 
some regions like Gizab the Taliban have succeed on influencing the decisions of 
these traditional communities' leaders. &quot;The administration of justice is a function 
that clearly belongs to the State of Afghanistan&quot;, the expert stated. &quot;It is entirely 
unacceptable for a non-state entity, such as the Taliban, to exercise a state function 
by trying and punishing an alleged criminal&quot;. In addition, &quot;the return to the practice 
of making a public spectacle of the execution harks back to the worst excesses of the 
old regime&quot;, he noted. After years of conflict, the people of Afghanistan need an 
effective, just, and transparent system of criminal justice that reflects its 
democratically elected institutions. The Special Rapporteur supports the 
international community and the Afghan people in their efforts to build a law abiding 
society.&#8221;

the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to 
the above allegations.

a envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant la situation de Amine Sidhoum Abderramane, avocat 
alg&#233;rien et d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme, membre de l&#8217;ONG SOS Disparus. Selon les 
informations re&#231;ues, Amine Sidhoum Abderramane aurait re&#231;u des menaces lors de la 
trente-neuvi&#232;me session de la Commission africaine des droits de l&#8217;homme et des peuples 
(CADHP), qui s&#8217;est tenue  &#224; Banjul (Gambie) du 11 au 25 mai 2006. Le 12 mai 2006, &#224; la

continent et notamment sur les cons&#233;quences de l&#8217;adoption de la Charte de r&#233;conciliation 
nationale en Alg&#233;rie. M. Sidhoum aurait &#233;t&#233; abord&#233; par un repr&#233;sentant de la d&#233;l&#233;gation 
alg&#233;rienne qui aurait tent&#233; de le dissuader de s&#8217;exprimer devant la Commission. Ce dernier 
lui aurait &#171; rappel&#233; &#187; que s&#8217;il persistait &#224; pr&#233;senter son intervention, il serait &#171; passible de 
trois &#224; cinq ans de prison d&#232;s [son retour] en Alg&#233;rie &#187;. Du fait de ces menaces, M. 
Sidhoum n&#8217;aurait pu intervenir oralement le 13 mai 2006. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, 
ces menaces serait li&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;article 46 de l&#8217;ordonnance du 27 f&#233;vrier 2006, portant sur la 
mise en &#339;uvre de la Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale qui  pr&#233;voit en effet 
une peine allant de trois &#224; cinq ans d&#8217;emprisonnement et une amende de 250 000 &#224; 500 000 
dinars alg&#233;riens (environ 2 830 &#224; 5 660 euros) pour &#171; quiconque qui, par ses d&#233;clarations, 
&#233;crits ou tout autre acte, utilise ou instrumentalise les blessures de la trag&#233;die nationale, 
pour porter atteinte aux institutions de la R&#233;publique alg&#233;rienne d&#233;mocratique et populaire,

Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux ont exprim&#233; leur profonde pr&#233;occupation face &#224; cette all&#233;gation qui 
semblerait indiquer que M.  Sidhoum aurait re&#231;u ces menaces afin de l&#8217;emp&#234;cher d&#8217;exercer 
son activit&#233; de d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme et l&#8217;aurait effectivement emp&#234;ch&#233; de

<p>discr&#233;dit sur une d&#233;cision de justice et de porter outrage &#224; un corps constitu&#233; de l&#8217;&#201;tat. M. 
Sidhoum encourrait une peine de trois &#224; six ann&#233;es d&#8217;emprisonnement et une amende 
comprise entre 230 000 et 450 000 DZD. Lors de son entretien avec la journaliste auteure de 
l&#8217;article susmentionn&#233;, M. Sidhoum aurait d&#233;nonc&#233; la <i>d&#233;tention</i> arbitraire de son client dans 
la prison de Seradji qui durait depuis 30 mois. Cependant, la journaliste n&#8217;aurait pas 
rapport&#233; de mani&#232;re fid&#232;le les propos de M. Sidhoum, &#233;crivant que le client de ce dernier &#171; 
passe son trenti&#232;me mois &#224; Serkadji suite &#224; une <i>d&#233;cision</i> arbitraire rendue par la Cour 
supr&#234;me &#187;. En effet, au moment o&#249; M. Sidhoum a tenu ces propos, aucune d&#233;cision n&#8217;avait 
encore &#233;t&#233; rendue par la Cour supr&#234;me, qui ne s&#8217;est prononc&#233;e que le 28 avril 2005, soit un 
an apr&#232;s la parution de l&#8217;article. En outre, d&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, M. Sidhoum 
aurait &#233;t&#233; convoqu&#233; le 22 ao&#251;t 2006 en tant qu&#8217;accus&#233; par le juge d&#8217;instruction du tribunal de

au 9 septembre 2006, &#224; la demande de M. Sidhoum. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es que les 
charges retenues contre M. Sidhoum ne visent &#224; emp&#234;cher ce dernier de poursuivre ses 
action en faveur de la d&#233;fense des droits des familles de disparus au sein de SOS Disparu(e)s

d&#8217;instruction du tribunal de Bab El Oued en raison des poursuites initi&#233;es &#224; leur encontre 
pour avoir remis &#224; leurs clients retenus en prison des documents relatifs &#224; leur d&#233;fense. 
Ainsi, dans le cas de M. Boumerdassi, il s&#8217;agirait du dossier du proc&#232;s verbal du d&#233;tenu

adress&#233;es par le juge &#224; M Mesli, celui-ci n&#8217;y a jamais r&#233;pondu, puis a quitt&#233; le territoire 
national. De ce fait, il a &#233;t&#233; consid&#233;r&#233; par la justice comme &#233;tant en fuite. La m&#234;me

Rapporteur sp&#233;cial le 26 mai 2006, apportant un d&#233;menti aux all&#233;gations de la 
communication. Le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a inscrit dans sa Constitution un 
chapitre sur les droits et libert&#233;s et un autre sur le pouvoir judiciaire. Il consid&#232;re que les 
textes juridiques cit&#233;s dans la communication, relatifs &#224; la mise en &#339;uvre de la Charte pour 
la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale sont conformes aux engagements internationaux 
contract&#233;s et que les affirmations selon lesquelles l&#8217;ordonnance r&#233;tr&#233;cit le champ d&#8217;activit&#233; 
des citoyens ne reposent sur aucun fondement juridique recevable. Le respect int&#233;gral des 
droits des citoyens serait pr&#233;serv&#233; aussi bien par l&#8217;Ordonnance que par les d&#233;crets 
d&#8217;application qui seraient compatibles avec les dispositions des trait&#233;s auxquels l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie 
est partie. L&#8217;ordonnance du 27 f&#233;vrier 2006 n&#8217;&#233;mettrait aucune objection &#224; l&#8217;exercice de la 
libert&#233; d&#8217;expression qui est clairement inscrite &#224; l&#8217;article 41 de la Constitution. De m&#234;me, 
la libert&#233; d&#8217;association resterait ouverte &#224; tous les citoyens jouissant de leurs droits civiques, </p>

<p>comme &#233;nonc&#233; par la loi organique relative aux associations &#224; caract&#232;re politique du 6 mars

figurent d&#233;j&#224; &#224; l&#8217;article 42 de la Constitution alg&#233;rienne ainsi que dans ladite loi organique 
et concernent uniquement les personnes qui instrumentalisent la religion &#224; des fins 
criminelles ou celles qui pr&#244;nent la violence contre la nation et les institutions de l&#8217;&#201;tat. Le 
Gouvernement a ajout&#233; que bien que le droit d&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; la justice et le droit d&#8217;exercer un 
recours soient &#233;rig&#233;s en droit par le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques, 
il reste que ces droits accord&#233;s aux justiciables doivent de respecter les proc&#233;dures 
nationales pr&#233;vues &#224; cet effet. Le Gouvernement a soulign&#233; que le chapitre six de 
l&#8217;Ordonnance portant Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale a &#233;t&#233; pl&#233;biscit&#233; par 
le peuple alg&#233;rien, seule source de l&#233;gitimit&#233;, lors du r&#233;f&#233;rendum du 28 septembre 2005. 
Cette disposition viserait le traitement l&#233;gal, social et humain d&#8217;une situation fort complexe 
induite par une d&#233;cennie de criminalit&#233; terroriste &#224; grande &#233;chelle. Elle aurait pour but de 
prot&#233;ger le droit des citoyennes et des citoyens, qui se sont prononc&#233;es &#224; 99 % des voix 
contre toute attaque ou remise en cause de la part des tiers. Le Gouvernement a d&#233;clar&#233; que 
le choix du peuple devait &#234;tre respect&#233;. Il a conclu en affirmant que les textes d&#8217;application 
de la Charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale &#233;taient en conformit&#233; avec la 
l&#233;gislation internationale s&#8217;agissant de la qualit&#233; de victime et d&#8217;ayants droits et retiennent

22. Le 15 novembre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent envoy&#233; par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial le 8 septembre 2006. Le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que l&#8217;avocat Amin

&#233;dition du 30 mai 2004, qualifiant d&#8217;arbitraire la d&#233;cision rendue par le tribunal &#224; 
l&#8217;encontre de M Aoufi, client de l&#8217;avocat. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien estime que les 
d&#233;clarations de M. Sidhoum jetaient le discr&#233;dit sur une d&#233;cision de justice et portaient

pas avoir re&#231;u de r&#233;ponse du Gouvernement relative &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 5 octobre 2006. Le

consid&#233;ration le contexte dans lequel s&#8217;inscrit l&#8217;Ordonnance portant Charte pour la paix et

Commission des droits de l&#8217;homme (r&#233;solution 2005/66), le Comit&#233; des droits de l&#8217;homme 
(voir CCPR/C/79/Add.63 et CCPR/C/19/D/107/1981) et le Groupe de travail sur les

25. El 24 de enero de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n 
con la crisis institucional que atraviesa el Poder Judicial de la provincia de Misiones. De las 
informaciones recibidas de manera reiterativa, surgen una serie de irregularidades que se 
estar&#237;an cometiendo en el &#225;mbito del Poder Judicial y que atentar&#237;an contra su 
independencia. Las principales alegaciones denuncian que el 12 de enero de 2006, la Juez 
del Superior Tribunal de la Provincia de Misiones, Marta Catella, fue suspendida de su </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 19 
</p>
<p>cargo por la Sala Acusadora de la legislatura provincial tras una veloz tramitaci&#243;n de un 
juicio pol&#237;tico en su contra, susceptible de culminar  en su destituci&#243;n.  La rapidez con la 
que se est&#225;n llevando a cabo las etapas procesales, adem&#225;s de otras irregularidades,  hace 
dudar seriamente del respeto a la garant&#237;a del debido proceso. De hecho, la comisi&#243;n 
investigadora de la Sala Acusadora habr&#237;a emitido  dictamen acusatorio sin escuchar a la 
juez y sin  haberle dado traslado de la denuncia y de las pruebas en su contra. Entre la 
declaraci&#243;n de admisibilidad de la denuncia y la acusaci&#243;n s&#243;lo transcurrieron 16 d&#237;as. 
Entre las irregularidades m&#225;s notorias del tr&#225;mite, las alegaciones se&#241;alan  las siguientes. 
Por un lado, la admisibilidad del pedido de juicio pol&#237;tico se habr&#237;a declarado en una 
reuni&#243;n reservada, en contra de lo dispuesto por la Ley provincial N.&#186; 120 que reglamenta 
el juicio pol&#237;tico. Por otro lado,  el dictamen acusatorio se habr&#237;a elaborado  sin que se 
hubiera dado traslado a la acusada del pedido de destituci&#243;n, de la resoluci&#243;n que dispone 
la admisibilidad del pedido, como el resto de actuaciones, a pesar de que constaba una 
solicitud expresa de Marta Catella en tal sentido. Asimismo, la juez  se habr&#237;a encontrado  
imposibilitada de ejercer el derecho de recusar a los miembros de la Comisi&#243;n 
Investigadora y de la Sala Acusadora ya que no se hizo lugar a su pedido de conocer 
quienes lo integraban, lo que al mismo tiempo le impidi&#243; ejercer el control sobre la 
parcialidad de los miembros de esta Sala. Finalmente, el 12 de enero la Sala Acusadora 
decidi&#243; aprobar la acusaci&#243;n contra Marta Catella, sin haber notificado previamente a la 
juez acusada la celebraci&#243;n de la sesi&#243;n, ni darle traslado del dictamen acusatorio. En 
definitiva, Marta Catella se encuentra suspendida actualmente, sin goce de haberes, sin 
haber podido tener acceso a la denuncia ni a la acusaci&#243;n, y sin haber podido ejercer en 
ning&#250;n momento el derecho de defensa. 
</p>
<p> 
26. Conforme a declaraciones p&#250;blicas, la acusaci&#243;n se funda en dos votos emitidos por 
Marta Catella. El primero, en un recurso de apelaci&#243;n interpuesto por el Intendente de San 
Vicente (provincia de Misiones), contra la decisi&#243;n del Concejo Deliberante de destituirlo 
(Resoluci&#243;n N 492-STJ-05). El segundo voto de Marta Catella que se invoca en la 
acusaci&#243;n es el reca&#237;do en un incidente de nulidad, tambi&#233;n presentado por el Intendente de 
San Vicente en la misma causa, en virtud del cual se declar&#243; la nulidad de diversas 
actuaciones en el expediente principal, incluida la sentencia (Resoluci&#243;n N.&#186; 576-STJ-05). 
En virtud de la declaraci&#243;n de nulidad, la cuesti&#243;n que origina el pedido de juicio pol&#237;tico 
(que contempla la falsedad o no del Acta 08/05 y de la Resoluci&#243;n 07/05 del Concejo 
Deliberante) se encuentra pendiente de resoluci&#243;n judicial. Las alegaciones se&#241;alan este 
aspecto como de suma gravedad  por constituir al Poder Legislativo como una nueva 
instancia revisora, contrariando el principio republicano de separaci&#243;n de poderes, y 
vulnerando la independencia judicial de los magistrados que ya se han pronunciado. Pero 
adem&#225;s, sostener la acusaci&#243;n  de Marta Catella por el contenido del voto emitido, podr&#237;a 
configurar una suerte de amenaza de destituci&#243;n a los jueces que actualmente entienden en 
la causa judicial, ya que correr&#237;an  el riesgo de que, si votaran  en sentido concordante a 
como lo hizo la magistrada Catella, podr&#237;an  sufrir las mismas consecuencias, esto es  ser 
denunciados con el prop&#243;sito de ser  destituidos. Las alegaciones tambi&#233;n indican que este 
proceso fue iniciado por el Intendente de San Vicente, del partido de gobierno, pocos d&#237;as 
despu&#233;s que la Juez Catella &#8212;a cargo del Tribunal Electoral de la Provincia&#8212;  se 
pronunciara  en forma adversa a las pretensiones del Gobierno provincial. Marta Catella 
aplic&#243; una cl&#225;usula de la Constituci&#243;n Provincial que reserva un m&#237;nimo de un tercio de la </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 20 
</p>
<p>representaci&#243;n legislativa a la minor&#237;a &#8212;y que no establece un umbral m&#237;nimo de votos 
para acceder a un cargo&#8212; en contra de los intereses del oficialismo que aspiraba se le 
reconociera dos bancas: una en la C&#225;mara de Representantes y otra en el Concejo 
Deliberante de El Dorado. 
</p>
<p> 
27. Este proceso se da en un contexto de persecuci&#243;n pol&#237;tica contra jueces independientes 
en la provincia de Misiones, que incluye el reciente pedido de destituci&#243;n del juez penal 
Horacio Alarc&#243;n, quien hab&#237;a ordenado el procesamiento por homicidio del hijo de una 
diputada del partido de gobierno y  el juicio pol&#237;tico promovido contra el fiscal de Estado 
Lloyd Jorge Wicstr&#246;m, quien ha denunciado p&#250;blicamente diversos casos de corrupci&#243;n 
administrativa del actual gobierno provincial  incluso en medios nacionales. En el caso del 
Juez Horacio Alarc&#243;n, el Presidente del Tribunal de Enjuiciamiento le habr&#237;a requerido  al 
propio juez  en forma irregular que le enviara  el expediente en el que se investigaba la 
muerte de Mar&#237;a Elena B&#225;rbaro, cuando faltaban pocos d&#237;as para que expirara el plazo que 
ten&#237;a Alarc&#243;n  para resolver la situaci&#243;n procesal de los imputados, adem&#225;s de haberle 
ordenado  que se abstuviera de realizar cualquier tramitaci&#243;n  en la causa antes de la 
entrega del  expediente. Las alegaciones insisten en que, con posterioridad, el Presidente 
del Tribunal de Enjuiciamiento no devolvi&#243; el Expediente en tiempo oportuno para que el 
juez resolviera a t&#233;rmino. Las alegaciones rese&#241;an tambi&#233;n una serie de resoluciones y 
acuerdos -que se encuentran publicados en Internet- en los que la alta magistrada no da 
curso a solicitudes del Gobierno o rechaza sus planteos jur&#237;dicos. Por &#250;ltimo se se&#241;ala que 
el poder pol&#237;tico, recientemente, ha modificado normas legales que le confieren al la 
posibilidad de cambiar la composici&#243;n actual del Superior Tribunal de Justicia de la 
Provincia,  con el prop&#243;sito de ejercer mayor control a trav&#233;s de las nuevas designaciones.  
</p>
<p> 
28. El 7 de julio de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n respecto de la 
situaci&#243;n de Marta Catella, quien fue suspendida el 12 de enero de 2006 en su cargo como 
Jueza del Superior Tribunal de la Provincia de Misiones por la Sala Acusadora de la 
legislatura provincial. Asimismo, se llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n sobre la situaci&#243;n de Horacio 
Alarc&#243;n, Juez Penal de la provincia de Misiones, y Lloyd Jorge Wicstr&#246;m, Fiscal de Estado 
en la misma provincia, quienes seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida eran objeto de sendos juicios 
pol&#237;ticos promovidos por el gobierno provincial. La situaci&#243;n de las personas mencionadas 
ha sido objeto de una previa comunicaci&#243;n enviada el d&#237;a 24 de enero de 2006. En dicha 
comunicaci&#243;n se solicita la aclaraci&#243;n de varios puntos relacionados con las 
investigaciones y juicios iniciados en contra de dichas personas, as&#237; como con relaci&#243;n a la 
situaci&#243;n general de la independencia del poder judicial en la provincia de Misiones.

<p> 
<b>Comunicaciones recibidas  
</b> 
29. El 26 de enero de 2006, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada por el 
Relator Especial el 13 de octubre de 2005. El Gobierno indica que en la provincia del 
Neuqu&#233;n funciona plenamente la divisi&#243;n de los poderes, resguardando de esta forma los 
derechos individuales y evitando la concentraci&#243;n de poder. Por ello, la apreciaci&#243;n 
referida a &quot;la grave crisis institucional&quot; del Poder Judicial alegando &quot;supuestas injerencias&quot; 
entre Poderes, en modo alguno puede aventar una respuesta oficial, dado que no existe esa 
&quot;crisis&quot; mencionada. El Poder Judicial es el instrumento b&#225;sico para mantener el equilibrio </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 21 
</p>
<p>del sistema. La administraci&#243;n de justicia ha quedado reservada en forma permanente, 
exclusiva y excluyente a ese Poder, vedando su administraci&#243;n por los otros poderes del 
Estado, lo cual se traduce fundamentalmente en el ejercicio de funciones por jueces con 
independencia personal y con libertad de cualquier influencia o presi&#243;n exterior. El 
Gobierno agrega que la designaci&#243;n de los magistrados en la provincia del Neuqu&#233;n 
tambi&#233;n ha respondido inexcusablemente a las prescripciones legales vigentes en dicha 
materia, y esta provincia, al igual que sus pares, es un Estado aut&#243;nomo, lo que implica la 
facultad de darse sus propias normas en lo que hace al funcionamiento de las instituciones. 
En los casos de referencia puntual que se&#241;ala el Relator Especial en su nota, cada uno se 
encuentra dentro de la jurisdicci&#243;n de sus jueces naturales. As&#237;, en el caso de jury de 
enjuiciamiento al Fiscal Menda&#241;a, integrado por aquellos designados por la ley para 
conocer y juzgar, existe un proceso en marcha en el que aun no se ha dictado sentencia, por 
lo que rige plenamente el principio de inocencia del imputado. La funci&#243;n de la Fiscal&#237;a de 
Estado fue realizar la acusaci&#243;n por subrogancia, atento que el &#243;rgano acusador natural es 
el Ministerio Publico, pero en esta circunstancia el acusado es precisamente parte de dicho 
ministerio. El mencionado Jury se ha instruido a partir de una acusaci&#243;n que conten&#237;a cinco 
cargos: <i>a</i>) su participaci&#243;n en la denominada &quot;experiencia piloto&quot;, <i>b</i>) por declaraciones 
publicas injuriantes y descalificantes a los tres poderes constituidos, <i>c</i>) por excesiva 
morosidad en el desempe&#241;o de su funci&#243;n, <i>d</i>) por realizar actividad privada incompatible 
con su rol de magistrado prestando asistencia t&#233;cnica a un pa&#237;s extranjero en desmedro de 
su dedicaci&#243;n exclusiva, <i>e</i>) por apropiaci&#243;n il&#237;cita de dos lotes de propiedad del Municipio 
de Neuqu&#233;n, realizando asimismo tres conexiones clandestinas de agua desde la red 
publica. El primer cargo fue desistido por la Fiscal&#237;a de Estado en consonancia con el 
reciente criterio de la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Naci&#243;n adoptado en Acordada 
712005 del 24 de febrero de 2005 (es decir: con posterioridad al inicio de jury), y fue 
solicitada su absoluci&#243;n, lo que as&#237; se resolvi&#243;. En relaci&#243;n al tercer cargo, tambi&#233;n fue 
desistido, por haberse considerado probado que la mora existente es de todos los &#225;mbitos 
del Poder Judicial y no atribuible exclusivamente al Dr. Menda&#241;a. 
 
30. Las recusaciones fueron motivo de recurso por parte del enjuiciado y resueltas no solo 
por el Jurado de Enjuiciamiento, sino que &quot;innovadoramente&quot; se interpuso una acci&#243;n de 
amparo contra el funcionamiento del mencionado Jury, amparo que fue debidamente 
resuelto por todas las instancias de apelaci&#243;n locales, cuya ultima instancia ha debido 
integrarse con conjueces por la excusaci&#243;n de los miembros acusados de &quot;falta de 
imparcialidad&quot;. Dicho fallo se encuentra firme en lo que hace a la Jurisdicci&#243;n local, por lo 
cual el Jurado de Enjuiciamiento ha debido retomar su tramite suspendido por el 
improcedente &quot;amparo&quot;. Conforme informaci&#243;n suministrada por la Fiscal&#237;a de Estado a 
requerimiento de este &#243;rgano asesor, dicho organismo ya ha producido toda la prueba, y 
entiende probados todos los cargos que fueron objeto de la acusaci&#243;n, ya se produjeron los 
alegatos y ello esta siendo actualmente merituado por el Jurado, por lo que la valoraci&#243;n de 
dicha prueba excede el marco de actuaci&#243;n de ese organismo. Para mayor ilustraci&#243;n, el 
Gobierno acompa&#241;&#243; antecedentes en tal sentido. Por su parte, el pedido de Jurado de 
Enjuiciamiento al Dr. Tribug fue dejado sin efecto y archivado por la Legislatura Neuquina 
en uso de facultades que le son propias. El Poder Judicial es un Poder Constituido 
Independiente, por lo cual goza de todas las prerrogativas necesarias para adecuar su 
funcionamiento, mientras dicho ejercicio no contrar&#237;e principios de raigambre </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 22 
</p>
<p>constitucional. En caso de sospecharse el ejercicio irregular de la funci&#243;n por parte de 
alguno de sus miembros, existen mecanismos constitucionales para poner remedio a tal 
situaci&#243;n y compatibilizarla con el inter&#233;s social de obtener una justicia eficaz. Me refiero 
especialmente al instituto del juicio pol&#237;tico como mecanismo de remoci&#243;n de los 
integrantes cuestionados. En relaci&#243;n al caso denominado &quot;c&#225;maras ocultas&quot;, tambi&#233;n 
existe un proceso judicial en tramite que se ha de respetar y atenerse a lo que en este 
supuesto resuelva finalmente la Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Naci&#243;n. Respecto de las 
supuestas amenazas a la Defensora de la Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia y sus adjuntas, en el caso de 
haberse denunciado alguna intimidaci&#243;n de este tipo, debe tambi&#233;n necesariamente 
tramitar y dirimirse, mediante un adecuado proceso, ante los &#243;rganos p&#250;blicos competentes 
que integran el Poder Judicial, como encargados de investigar y evaluar la aplicaci&#243;n o no 
de sanciones penales, con la finalidad de asegurar la efectividad del derecho y la 
continuidad del orden jur&#237;dico. A tal fin deber&#225; en todo caso solicitarse informe al 
organismo oficial que registra las denuncias de este tipo, ya que trat&#225;ndose de una 
funcionaria publica la involucrada, esta tiene obligaci&#243;n legal de denunciar. Por todo ello y 
en virtud de los principios expuestos con respecto a la actuaci&#243;n de uno de los Poderes 
fundamentales del Estado Provincial, a fin de ser respetuoso del accionar del mismo y de 
evitar cualquier intromisi&#243;n en tal sentido, el Gobierno indic&#243; que la &#250;nica alternativa 
posible era esperar el dictado de las resoluciones judiciales pertinentes en cada uno de los 
casos denunciados. 
 
31. El 14 de febrero de 2006, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada por el 
Relator especial el 13 de octubre de 2005. El Gobierno proporcion&#243; las siguientes 
respuestas a las preguntas formuladas por el Relator especial: 
</p>
<p>1) Para responder este requerimiento, se contesta sobre la exactitud de los hechos 
denunciados, conforme el orden e individualizaci&#243;n de los sucesos enunciados en el 
apartado Resumen de las Alegaciones del cuestionario remitido: 
</p>
<p>i)<b> </b>Es correcta la alegaci&#243;n referida al reemplazo de la totalidad de los cinco 
vocales que integran el Tribunal Superior de Justicia (TSJ) de la provincia, 
producido entre febrero de 2004 y febrero de 2005. En febrero de 2004, pocos 
d&#237;as despu&#233;s de que Jorge Sobisch asumiera su tercer periodo <b>&#8212;</b>y<b> </b>segundo 
periodo consecutivo&#8212; como gobernador de Neuqu&#233;n, fueron designados 
como jueces del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de la Provincia, a propuesta del 
Poder Ejecutivo y con acuerdo de la Legislatura, Roberto Fern&#225;ndez, Jorge 
Sommariva y Eduardo Badano. Los tres nuevos vocales se desempe&#241;aban, 
hasta el momento de su designaci&#243;n, como jueces de C&#225;mara Criminal de 
Apelaciones y Juicio Oral de la provincia. El 15 de diciembre de 2004 la 
Legislatura Provincial design&#243; a Ricardo Tomas Kohon vocal del TSJ. El 
nombrado no era abogado penalista, y ocupaba hasta el momento de su 
designaci&#243;n la Presidencia del Colegio de Abogados de la ciudad de Neuqu&#233;n. 
En forma previa y pr&#243;xima a su designaci&#243;n, efectu&#243; manifestaciones 
p&#250;blicas criticando la &quot;experiencia piloto&quot; implementada en el fuero penal, 
invocada como causal de remoci&#243;n en la denuncia que dio inicio al jury 
contra el fiscal Ricardo Menda&#241;a. El 9 de febrero de 2005 la Legislatura 
Provincial design&#243; a Eduardo Felipe C&#237;a vocal del Tribunal Superior de 
Justicia (TSJ). El nombrado se desempe&#241;aba hasta el momento de su </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 23 
</p>
<p>designaci&#243;n como Fiscal en el fuero penal. Los diputados de la oposici&#243;n no 
participaron de las sesiones legislativas en que se realizaron las designaciones 
de Kohon y C&#237;a., en muestra de rechazo al mecanismo utilizado por el 
gobernador para proponer la tema de candidatos, quien omiti&#243; cumplir la ley 
provincial 685 que en su articulo 81 establece que &quot;en todos los casos en que 
el Poder Ejecutivo deba realizar os nombramientos&quot; de los vocales, defensor 
y fiscal del TSJ &quot;recabara previamente por escrito la opini&#243;n del Colegio de 
Abogados de la provincia ...&quot; . Los vocales Sommariva <b>y </b>Fern&#225;ndez votaron 
por el sobreseimiento de Sobisch en la causa de las c&#225;maras ocultas, mientras 
de desempe&#241;aron como camaristas. Badano lo hizo como vocal, cuando la 
causa lleg&#243; al TSJ;

</b>resultas de la modificaci&#243;n el TSJ design&#243; numerosos magistrados y 
funcionarios que, de encontrarse vigente el r&#233;gimen anterior, no habr&#237;an 
resultado elegibles por no reunir los votos necesarios para integrar la terna de 
los mas votados. Tal es el caso, entre muchos otros, de la designaci&#243;n en 
septiembre de 2004 del Fiscal a cargo de la Agencia Fiscal de Delitos contra 
la Administraci&#243;n P&#250;blica &#8212;Fiscal&#237;a Anticorrupci&#243;n&#8212; Pablo Vignaroli, 
quien obtuvo de la Comisi&#243;n Asesora solo dos votos - emitidos por los 
miembros pertenecientes al TSJ mientras otros tres candidatos obtuvieron 
mas votos que el nombrado. La elevada cantidad de designaciones efectuadas 
obedece a la creaci&#243;n de m&#225;s de 150 cargos en el Poder Judicial mediante la 
sanci&#243;n por la Legislatura Provincial de la ley 2475 en septiembre de 2004, 
conforme el proyecto presentado por el TSJ en agosto del mismo a&#241;o; 
</p>
<p>iv) No es exacto. El proyecto para la modificaci&#243;n de la Ley de Protecci&#243;n 
Integral de la<b> </b>Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia fue presentado en agosto de 2004 por el 
Poder Ejecutivo Provincial, a trav&#233;s de su Ministro de Seguridad Luis 
Manganaro. S&#237; es exacto que el contenido del proyecto afectaba gravemente 
las disposiciones de car&#225;cter protectorio de la ley y la actuaci&#243;n de la 
Defensor&#237;a del Ni&#241;o y<b> </b>Adolescente. El vocal del Tribunal Superior de Justicia, 
Roberto Fern&#225;ndez, respald&#243; el proyecto de reforma de la ley 2302. En una 
declaraci&#243;n publica concomitante a la presentaci&#243;n y debate del proyecto de 
ley, el funcionario amenaz&#243; a la Dra. Nara Oses, Defensora del Ni&#241;o y 
Adolescente, con iniciarle un Jury por haber expresado p&#250;blicamente su 
oposici&#243;n a la modificaci&#243;n de la ley. Es exacto que tanto la Defensora Titular 
Nara Oses como la Defensora Adjunta Edith Galarza sufrieron amenazas 
an&#243;nimas, que provocaron la iniciaci&#243;n de una investigaci&#243;n fiscal 
actualmente paralizada por falta de pruebas. 
</p>
<p>v) Es exacto; 
vi) Es exacto. En relaci&#243;n a los plazos del proceso, cabe agregar que el jury 
</p>
<p>iniciado por denuncia presentada el 9 de noviembre de 2004 y declarada 
admisible el 22 de diciembre de 2004, concluyo mediante la sentencia dictada 
el 19 de diciembre de 2005 -que dispuso la destituci&#243;n del enjuiciado y su </p>

Page 24 
</p>
<p>inhabilitaci&#243;n por cuatro arios<b> </b>para ejercer cargos p&#250;blicos-. Dable destacar 
que los jurados abogados fallaron por la absoluci&#243;n atento haberse vencido 
los plazos legales establecidos en la ley de enjuiciamiento; 
</p>
<p>2) En el a&#241;o 2003 los por entonces jueces de la C&#225;mara en lo Criminal Primera de la 
I Circunscripci&#243;n del Poder Judicial de Neuqu&#233;n, Jorge Oscar Sommariva y Roberto 
Fern&#225;ndez fallaron a favor del sobreseimiento del gobernador Jorge Omar Sobisch en el 
&quot;caso de la c&#225;mara oculta&quot;, con<b> </b>la disidencia de la camarista Cecilia Luzuriaga de 
Valdecantos. En febrero de 2004 los nombrados fueron promovidos como vocales del TSJ. 
Al declarar la jueza Cecilia Luzuriaga de Valdecantos como testigo en el jury de 
enjuiciamiento seguido a Ricardo Menda&#241;a, revel&#243; que Sommariva, cuando era Juez de la 
misma C&#225;mara que la testigo, le coment&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n porque Fern&#225;ndez - miembro 
por entonces del mismo Cuerpo - habr&#237;a ido a ver al Gobernador de la Provincia poco antes 
de fallar en la causa seguida contra el Gobernador (conocida como de &quot;las c&#225;maras 
ocultas&quot;); 
</p>
<p>3) El fiscal interviniente ante el Juzgado de Instrucci&#243;n fue el Dr. Pedro Telleriarte, 
titular de la Agencia Fiscal de Delitos contra la Administraci&#243;n Publica. El Dr. Ricardo 
Menda&#241;a intervino como Fiscal de C&#225;mara. En tal car&#225;cter intervino en<b> </b>audiencias, 
incidentes y en la audiencia de la apelaci&#243;n sosteniendo el recurso del Fiscal de Primera 
Instancia. Luego planteo el recurso de casaci&#243;n y la queja ante la casaci&#243;n denegada. 
Finalmente, actu&#243; como fiscal subrogante, interponiendo el recurso extraordinario; 
</p>
<p>4) Adem&#225;s de los vocales Sommariva y Fern&#225;ndez, fueron designados para integrar 
el mismo cuerpo, en febrero de 2004 y febrero de 2005, respectivamente, Eduardo Badano 
y Eduardo F. Cia, ambos con especialidad en derecho penal. El vocal Eduardo Badano fall&#243;, 
como miembro de dicho Alto Cuerpo, rechazando el recurso extraordinario deducido 
contra el sobreseimiento del gobernador Sobisch en la causa de las &quot;c&#225;maras ocultas&quot;;  
</p>
<p>5) S&#237; se ha iniciado Jury de Enjuiciamiento contra el fiscal Ricardo Menda&#241;a. Uno 
de los cargos contenidos en la denuncia que dio origen a1 proceso le acusa de &#8220;Haber 
violado en forma deliberada, sistem&#225;tica y manifiesta su deber esencial, y espec&#237;ficamente 
inherente a la funci&#243;n que a su cargo compete, es decir: velar por el estricto cumplimiento 
de la Constituci&#243;n y de las leyes&quot;, con fundamento en que el fiscal impuls&#243; desde la 
funci&#243;n &quot;las bondades del sistema acusatorio expresado en la acordada 3594/02&quot;, por la 
cual el Tribunal Superior de Justicia autoriz&#243; una nueva forma de trabajo de las agencias 
fiscales con el Juzgado de instrucci&#243;n N.&#186; 2. En cuanto a la participaci&#243;n en la iniciativa, 
debe se&#241;alarse que la Acordada 3594/02 tuvo como antecedente la &quot;propuesta conjunta&#8221; 
efectuada por los Dres. Ricardo Menda&#241;a (en calidad de Fiscal de C&#225;mara) y del Dr. Juan 
Jos&#233; Gago (titular del Juzgado de instrucci&#243;n N.&#186;<b> </b>2). La Acordada 3594/02 del TSJ fue 
dictada en fecha 30 de mayo de 2002 y suscripta por la totalidad de los por entonces 
miembros de dicho Tribunal. La modalidad de trabajo establecida por esta experiencia fue 
aplicada desde mayo de 2002 hasta febrero de 2004 en todos los asuntos tramitados ante el 
Juzgado de Instrucci&#243;n No<b> </b>2 y, a partir de los &#250;ltimos meses de 2003 hasta febrero de 2004 
en los asuntos tramitados ante el Juzgado de instrucci&#243;n N.&#186;<b> </b>1. Intervinieron en dichas 
causas los jueces titulares de los mencionados Juzgados y la totalidad de los funcionarios 
de los Ministerios P&#250;blicos Fiscal y de la Defensa con actuaci&#243;n ante los mencionados y en 
las instancias ulteriores de tr&#225;mite de los asuntos (Juzgados Correccionales, Jueces, 
Fiscales y Defensores de C&#225;mara, Jueces del TSJ y Fiscal y Defensor actuantes ante dicho 
Cuerpo). A los Dres. Alberto Tribug (Fiscal del TSJ) y Ricardo Menda&#241;a se les iniciaron </p>

</p>
<p>sendos procesos de remoci&#243;n con motivo de su participaci&#243;n en la experiencia piloto. No se 
adopt&#243; ninguna medida en relaci&#243;n a los restantes funcionarios y magistrados participantes 
en la experiencia; 
</p>
<p>6) El 19 de diciembre de 2004 el Dr. Menda&#241;a present&#243; la reacusaci&#243;n de tres de los 
integrantes del Jurado, espec&#237;ficamente los tres vocales del Tribunal Superior Jorge 
Sommariva, Roberto Fern&#225;ndez y Eduardo Badano por falta de imparcialidad, por varios 
motivos. Uno de ellos es por encontrarse en posici&#243;n funcional equivalente en relaci&#243;n a 
una de las causales (la llamada experiencia piloto), pues intervinieron en casos en los que 
se aplico esa modalidad de trabajo; adem&#225;s, porque tampoco impidieron esa forma de 
trabajo, que es una de las modalidades reprochadas al acusado y porque efectuaron 
declaraciones p&#250;blicas cuestionando la &quot;legalidad&quot; de esa practica en reuniones efectuadas 
con otros magistrados judiciales y tambi&#233;n ante legisladores. Otra de las causales se 
fundaba en que la mayor&#237;a de las declaraciones criticas reprochadas al Fiscal, estaban 
dirigidas a los propios recusados y hab&#237;an reconocido sentirse agraviados, de modo que si 
actuaban como jurados se convert&#237;an en jueces y partes. El acusado se&#241;al&#243; precisamente 
que no debe existir un antecedente como este, en donde el denunciante (autor material de la 
denuncia) en realidad expresa el inter&#233;s de quienes pretenden juzgarle, que son los 
afectados por la acci&#243;n (declaraciones) que se le adjudican. Para cada una de las causales se 
ofreci&#243; prueba. El 22 de diciembre de 2004, el Jurado resolvi&#243; que la reacusaci&#243;n tramitara 
en forma separada, sin suspender el pronunciamiento sobre la admisibilidad de la denuncia. 
Esta decisi&#243;n se logr&#243; por cuatro votos (incluidos los tres recusados) contra tres. Esto se 
plasmo en el Acuerdo No 156 - JE del Jurado. En el mismo acto, tambi&#233;n por cuatro votos 
(incluidos los tres recusados) contra tres, se decreto la admisibilidad de la denuncia y la 
suspensi&#243;n del funcionario, con la reducci&#243;n de salarios en un 50%. La Defensa interpuso 
una acci&#243;n de amparo a fin de que se declare la ilegalidad manifiesta de esa decisi&#243;n 
(admisibilidad de la denuncia y suspensi&#243;n), por haberse dictado violando el derecho a ser 
juzgado por &quot;jurados imparciales&quot;, violaci&#243;n del derecho de defensa, afectaci&#243;n del 
derecho al trabajo y al salario. Por este motivo se presento amparo que recay&#243; en el Jugado 
Laboral N.&#186; 2, que lo declaro inadmisible en casi todas sus partes, rechazando la medida 
cautelar peticionada (suspensi&#243;n de los procedimientos) por considerar que &quot;existen otros 
procesos mas id&#243;neos que el amparo, en tanto estas cuestiones, dada su complejidad, 
relevancia, trascendencia institucional y extensi&#243;n a terceros, ameritan la necesidad de un 
mayor debate jur&#237;dico de las mismas&quot;. Dijo tambi&#233;n la magistrada que, en tanto la decisi&#243;n 
cuestionada reviste el car&#225;cter de acto administrativo, goza de la presunci&#243;n de legalidad y 
legitimidad. Esta resoluci&#243;n se adopt&#243; el 30 de diciembre de 2004. Continuado el proceso 
de jury y en virtud de la violaci&#243;n de la garant&#237;a del juez imparcial y de la defensa en juicio 
se presenta nuevo amparo por ante juez con competencia en material penal, que es el que 
luego de las diversas instancias apelatorias se encuentra a la fecha recurrido por ante la 
Excelent&#237;sima Corte Suprema de Justicia de la Naci&#243;n; <b>

<p><b>Communications sent  
 
</b></p>
<p>34. On 15 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief concerning Amer Haddara, Shane Kent, 
Fadal Sayadi, Abdullah Merhi, Ahmed Raad, Ezzit Raad, Hany Taha, Aimen Joud and, 
Abdul Nacer Benbrika, held in Barwon Prison since November 2005; Bassam Raad, Majed 
Raad and Shoue Hammoud, held in Barwon Prison since March 2006; and Izzydeen Attik, 
arrested and remanded in Sydney in November 2005 and transferred to Barwon Prison 
before March 2006.  
 
35. According to the information received, the above-mentioned men are all being held at 
the maximum security Acacia Unit of Barwon Prison in Victoria, a facility originally 
designed for convicted prisoners only. They have been charged with various offences 
under the anti-terror provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The charges relate mostly 
to membership and support of a terrorist organization, but none of the above-mentioned 
persons has been charged with committing a terrorist act as such. Most of the men were at 
some point or are currently held in solitary confinement (some for up to 10 weeks), which 
means that during this period they do not have access to exercise yards or recreational 
facilities. The others are confined to their cells between 23 and 18 hours, and during the 
remaining period the possibility for contacts is severely restricted. Family visits are limited 
and the monthly contact visits are permitted only for children and not spouses, partners or 
other family members. Some of the detainees were held together with convicted prisoners 
for some time. Access by the detainees to their legal representatives is restricted and all 
communications between them are audio- and videotaped. All materials provided to and 
received by the detainees are scanned by the prison authorities. The diet of the detainees 
includes pork, which some of them consider offensive to their religious feelings. Some of 
the detainees&#8217; mental health has been affected by the detention conditions and the 
prolonged isolation. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>36. On 30 November 2006, the Government of Australia replied to the urgent appeal sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 15 August 2006. The Government indicated that Bendrika, 
Atik, Haddara, Joud, Kent, Merhi, A. Raad, E. Raad, Sayadi and Taha had been arrested 
and charged in November 2005 and B. Raad and Hammoud in late March 2006. Each 
alleged offender has been charged with one count of being a member of a terrorist 
organization. Various additional charges have also been laid against some of them, 
including charges of intentionally recruiting a person to join a terrorist organization, 
intentionally making funds available to a terrorist organization, and being connected with 
the preparation for a terrorist act.  It added that on 1 September 2006, 11 of the alleged 
offenders were committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria on the charges 
under the Criminal Code. On 20 September 2006, the remaining two alleged offenders 
were committed to the Supreme Court to stand trial. All matters have been listed for a 
directions hearing in the Supreme Court on 1 December 2006. The Government asserted 
that they have had their applications for bail reviewed and rejected by judges of the 
Supreme Court. The Government recognized that they are being held within Barwon </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 28 
</p>
<p>Prison in the Acacia High Security Unit which houses both remand and convicted prisoners. 
However, the Government stressed that remand and convicted prisoners do not mix, 
consistent with Guideline 1.11 of the Standard Guidelines for Prisons under the Revised 
Standard Guidelines for Corrections in Australia 2004 (Standard Guidelines). It considers 
that this is also consistent with Rule 8 (b)of the Standard Minimum Rules on the Treatment 
of Prisoners which, while not a binding document, may be persuasive, and article 10 (2) (a) 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Government pointed out 
that Australia has a reservation to article 10 (2) (a) which states that the obligation under 
article 10 (2) (a) is to be achieved progressively, but stressed that Australia implements 
article 10 (2) notwithstanding its reservation, by ensuring that remand and convicted 
prisoners do not mix in Barwon Prison. Furthermore, the Government asserted that it had 
been informed by the department dealing with correctional services in Victoria that the 
alleged offenders have never been held in solitary confinement and that rather each 
prisoner has an individual cell. They spend approximately six hours out of their cells each 
day, which time they may choose to reduce by returning to their cell earlier. Remand 
prisoners normally exercise with one other prisoner. All prisoners are rotated as to who 
they may exercise with, but security concerns are paramount in deciding the mix of people. 
Victorian legislation provides that the minimum number of hours out of cell is one hour per 
day, which according to the Government is consistent with Rule 21 of the Standard 
Minimum Rules and Guidelines 2.47 of the Standard Guidelines. The Government further 
stated that remand prisoners are permitted one non-contact visit per week of one hour&#8217;s 
duration and one contact visit per month with any children under the age of 16 years. 
Remand prisoners have telephone access and are permitted to make 25 personal phone 
calls per week. The Government asserted that the prisoners who were the subject of the 
communication of the Special Rapporteur have reasonable access to their lawyers and 
facilities for preparing their defence consistent with both international standards and 
Australian guidelines. In this respect, the Government referred to the decision of His 
Honour Justice Eames who in his ruling dismissing the application for bail of Mr. Haddara 
in the Supreme Court of Victoria, allegedly noting that whilst &#8220;the preparation of the 
alleged offender&#8217;s legal defense was difficult to his lawyer because of the location and 
restrictive conditions of detention in the Acacia Unit at Barwon Prison&#8221;, he &#8220;was not 
persuaded that the applicant has been unreasonably denied access to lawyer. Indeed, the 
evidence is that he has made frequent contact with his lawyer&#8221;. The Government asserted 
that in other bail applications by Mr. Attik, Mr. Haddara, Mr. Taha and Mr. Merhi, His 
Honour&#8217;s finding was that these alleged offenders have reasonable access to their lawyer in 
accordance with article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p> 
37. It indicated that the Act and the Corrections Regulations 1998(Vic) regulate 
communications between remand prisoners and their lawyers. Under section 44 of the Act, 
all visitors to the prisoner, including lawyers, must submit to a formal search to detect the 
presence of drugs, weapons or metal articles. Papers brought into prison are also scanned 
for illicit drugs. Any person who refuses to submit to a search may be refused entry to the 
prison. Under section 47 (1) (m) of the Act, prisoners have the right to send confidential 
letters to and receive confidential letters from their legal representatives without prison 
staff opening their letters. However, this right is subject to sections 47A and 47B. Section 
47 A states that if there is a reasonable suspicion that a letter contains an unauthorized </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 29 
</p>
<p>article or substance that poses an immediate danger to any person, it may be disposed of, 
consistent with Principle 18 (3) of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons 
under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, General Assembly resolution 43/173, 
which allows restrictions on communications with legal advisers if necessary to  protect the 
security or good of the detention facility. Section 47B provides that certain confidential 
letters may be inspected if they appear suspicious. A suspicious letter may be held while 
the prisoner and lawyer are informed of the suspicion, and the letter may only be opened, 
but not read or censored, in the presence of the prisoner and the lawyer or his or her 
representative. The Government considers that this maintains the lawyer/client 
confidentiality required under Principle 8 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. 
The Government added that the alleged offenders have a computer with a DVD/CD-Rom 
drive in their cells to access the electronic brief evidence against them. They are allegedly 
able to make applications for any special arrangements they may require to assist them in 
the preparation of their defence, consistent with article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant and with 
Guidelines 1.15., 1.17, and 2.4 of the Standard Guidelines. It further stated that the 
detainees do not have limits on the number of visits from professionals, except by the 
conflicting demands of other prisoners to have access to the contact rooms available for 
professional visits, in accordance with article 14 (3) (b) of the Covenant. It pointed out that 
there is a system of booking the contact room to guarantee access. Lawyers may visit their 
clients in the Acacia Unit between 8.45 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. Visits are video monitored for 
security purposes, but there is no audio sound or recording. Remand prisoners may make 
an unlimited number of legal professional calls, and are able to make these legal 
professional calls between 8.30 a.m. and 3 p.m. each day, consistence with Principle 8 of 
the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, Rule 93 of the Standard Minimum Rules and 
Guideline 1.17 of the Standard Guidelines. Finally, the Government declared that it has 
also thoroughly investigated all allegations of mistreatment by the alleged offenders and 
according to its findings the alleged offenders are being treated with humanity and respect 
for their inherent dignity of the human person.

</b>38. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Australia for its cooperation and 
values its efforts in providing substantive and detailed information in response to the above 
allegations. He further wishes to ask the Government to provide information about the 
hearing in the Supreme Court on 1 December 2006.

39. On 7 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Ruslan Bessonov, aged 17 , Maksim Genashilkin, 16, and Dmitri 
Pavlov, 16, from the village of Eni Genushli, near Baku, who are currently being held at the 
third pre-trial detention facility in Shuvlani, on the outskirts of Baku, or in the Ranaman 
district police administration building in Baku. According to the information received, on </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 30 
</p>
<p>14 March 2005, the three were detained and taken to the 33rd police precinct in Surakhan, 
where for two days they were subjected to severe beatings and other forms of torture by 
police officials and officials from the office of the public prosecutor (inter alia, Senior 
Investigator Mageriam Azizbekov and Suakhanskii district prosecutor Mr. Ilkhdrimzade). 
All three were denied access to a lawyer and to their parents during their initial detention. 
Compelled by severe beatings, kicking and threats, the boys were forced to sign 
confessions and accusations against one another of participation in the murder of Vusal 
Zeinalov on 15 February 2005, which they all deny. Ruslan Bessonov faced additional 
beatings in June 2005 while he was in the third pre-trial detention facility (SIZO) on the 
outskirts of Baku. The three sustained bruises on their legs, feet, back and torso and suffer 
from pain in their heads and stomachs. All of them suffer from psychological trauma. As a 
result of the torture in March 2005, Ruslan suffered contusions on his head that produced 
large bumps. None received adequate medical treatment. Currently, the boys are being held 
at the third pre-trial detention facility in Shuvlani in cells with four or five other boys and 
one adult. Ventilation and light in the cell are poor, the quality of the drinking water is bad 
and the nutrition insufficient. They are allowed 5-10 minutes of exercise per day and do not 
have access to education. At times, they are taken to the Ranaman district police 
administration building in Baku, where they are held in isolation for up to 10 days, get only 
one meal per day and are not allowed to exercise at all. They have been held in pre-trial 
detention for more than a year, pending the investigation that has now been ongoing for 
more than 13 months. Officials have refused to investigate the allegations of torture.

40. On 17 July 2006, the Government of Azerbaijan replied to the urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 7 April 2006. The Government indicated that criminal proceedings 
have been instituted against Ruslan Bessonov, Maksim Genashilkin, and Dmitri Pavlov on 
charges of the premeditated murder of Vusal Zeynalov. It indicated that the investigation 
was conducted by the Surakhany District and Baky City Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and that the 
criminal case was transferred for cognizance to the Court on Grave Crimes of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan on 13 April 2006. Concerning the allegations of torture, the Government 
ascertained that the three defendants had medical examinations and that the results of this 
investigation and forensic medical examination showed that neither violence nor torture 
was committed. In connection with allegation of torture committed against Ruslan 
Bessonov, the Government stated that as a result of investigation, it was ascertained that 
Maharram Azizbayov Ruslan Bessonov, inspector of the Surakhany District Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office, had met with R. Bessonov in  the investigative isolator on 23 June 2005 and 
submitted to him a copy of the indictment against him. During this meeting, he allegedly 
asked R. Bessonov to give true testimonies at the court hearing, and he did not commit any 
violence or torture against him. The Government pointed out that an investigation was 
carried out at the request of lawyer T. Aliyev, who filed an application to the Head of the 
Department on 15 July 2005 for the implementation of court rulings of the Ministry of 
Justice asking for an examination of  the facts regarding violence in the course of the 
investigation used against Ruslan Bessonov. The investigation showed that R.Bessonov 
did not apply either to the governing board of the investigative isolator or the medical 
centre on 23 June 2005, or during subsequent days. The Government further argued that </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 31 
</p>
<p>during the investigation, E. Namazov and O. Yusifov, supervisors of investigative isolator 
No. 3, indicated that Ruslan Bessonov, after meeting with inspector Maharram Azizbayov 
on the way to the cell, said nothing about any violence, torture or menace used against him, 
and they did not observe any injuries on his body. A medical examination of R. Bessonov 
was conducted on the basis of T. Aliyev&#8217;s application, and no pathological signs were 
discovered on his body or internal organs. As regards violence against R.Bessonov 
committed by inspectors carrying out the investigation and police officers of Surakhany 
District Police Department No. 33 on 14 March 2005, the Government pointed out that this 
fact was not confirmed and neither R. Bessonov nor other defendants or their lawyers had 
applied on that issue to the investigative agencies. The Government has ensured that the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan has put the trial of this criminal case 
under special supervision and that it would ensure full, comprehensive and objective court 
proceedings against the defendants.

<p><b> 
</b>41. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Azerbaijan for its cooperation and 
its detailed responses to his communication. The Special Rapporteur notes with 
satisfaction that officials have investigated the allegation of torture and that the forensic 
medical examination showed that neither violence nor torture were committed. While 
noting with satisfaction that court control of the detention was made available, the Special 
Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the very long period of pre-trial detention, 
which amounts to more than a year, pending the investigation that has now been ongoing 
for more than 13 months. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall general comment No. 
8 of the Human Rights Committee, in which the Committee underlines that &#8220;pre-trial 
detention should be an exception and as short as possible&#8221;.

</b>42. On 13 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences concerning Z.A, S.F, 
S.L, S.I.H and S.A.A. According to information received, Z.A was regularly beaten by her 
husband, whom she married in 1992. In 2004, the couple&#8217;s Filipina domestic worker 
alleged that the husband had repeatedly raped her and she had become pregnant as a result. 
The Jinai Court eventually convicted the husband for adultery, holding that use of force 
could not be proven, and sentenced him to one month of imprisonment. When Z.A filed for 
divorce in the Sharia High Court (Jaffaria Department), presiding judge Naser Al-Asfur 
reportedly only granted a divorce after she renounced any rights to alimony and signed 
over property to her husband. An appeal is pending in the Court of Appeal. S.F was 
married in 1994 at the age of 17 and had three children (now aged 8, 10 and 12) with her 
husband. From 1999, the husband attempted to force her to have sexual relations with other 
men for money. She repeatedly reported this matter to the authorities, but the police 
refused to open a case against her husband, who is a police officer himself. In 2000, S.F 
successfully filed for divorce in the Sharia High Court (Sunni Department) and was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 32 
</p>
<p>granted custody of her children. In 2003, a friend of the husband allegedly invited her to his 
house under a pretext. After she had entered the house, the husband allegedly arranged for  
police to arrest her on charges of adultery. She spent 20 days in pre-trial detention before 
the charges were dropped. During her detention, the husband successfully asked for a 
provisional court order assigning custody of the children to him. The case is still pending in 
court and the children reside with the husband. S.L married her husband in 1996, at the age 
of 15 years, and has a 2-year-old daughter with him. She filed for divorce in the Sharia 
High Court (Jaffaria Department) in 2003, because the husband allegedly drank, used 
marijuana and beat her during her pregnancy. Presiding judge Naser Al-Asfur reportedly 
told her that she has to renounce her rights to custody or alimony and sign over property to 
her husband before he could grant a divorce. A court clerk named Maky allegedly tried to 
force her to have sexual relations with him under the guise of a temporary marriage of 
convenience (<i>Mutaa</i>). In exchange he offered to intervene with the judge on her behalf.  
</p>
<p> 
43. S.I.H, a Bahraini national of Egyptian origin, married her husband in 1993 and had two 
children, aged 13 and 11, with him. When the husband began to drink and failed to support 
the family, in addition to beating her, she filed for divorce in the Sharia High Court 
(Jaffaria Department). Presiding judge Hamit Al-Asfur reportedly tried to pressure her to 
renounce her right to custody of her children before granting a divorce. Initially she was 
allowed to see her children once a week, but this right was rescinded in 2004. The divorce 
case is still pending in court. S.A.A married her husband in 2000 and has a daughter, aged 
5, with him. She filed for divorce in Sharia High Court (Jaffaria Department), with Judge 
Zakaria Al-Sadadi presiding. Custody of the daughter was temporarily assigned to S.A.A, 
but her husband was granted the right to take his daughter with him twice a week. It is 
alleged that the husband sexually abused his daughter on some of these occasions. 
Following one incident, the head of the Child Protection Committee in Bahrain reportedly 
issued a report that supported the allegations. Notwithstanding this report, the authorities 
reportedly took five full days to refer her daughter for examination by a medical doctor at 
the Criminal Directorate, who at that point only found some scaring on the daughter&#8217;s 
thighs. Despite the allegations, the Sharia High Court extended the husband&#8217;s visiting 
rights to six hours a week. S.A.A&#8217;s appeal against this decision was reportedly rejected on 
9 May 2006. Reportedly, Bahrain does not have a codified family law that stipulates clear 
and equitable norms on divorce or child custody. As a result, judges can decide cases 
according to their personal interpretation of Sharia and their interpretation reportedly often 
favours men. Concern is expressed that a considerable number of women in Bahrain could 
be trapped in violent relationships, because they fear having to renounce child custody 
rights or property rights in order to be granted a divorce.

</b>44. The Government of Bahrain replied to the allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 13 June 2006 with a letter dated 21 August 2006. The Government stated 
that Bahrain gives great importance to human rights and in particular to the rights of 
women. It pointed out that this importance is reflected in the Constitution which provides 
for rights and obligations enabling women to enjoy all the rights of the society. In 
particular, it provides for equality before the law and respect of human dignity, in its article </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 33 
</p>
<p>18, and guarantees the equal right to fair trial and free legal assistance. The Government 
added that the legislation clearly guarantees women&#8217;s civil and political rights as well as 
economic, social and cultural rights. It further stated that Bahrain has ratified several 
international conventions for the protection of human rights, notably the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 2002, which has been 
incorporated in the internal legislation, and has created a specialized agency promoting 
women&#8217;s rights, the Supreme Council of Women in 2001. Regarding the allegations of 
human rights violations, the Government stated that it has transmitted a copy of the letter of 
the Special Rapporteurs to the Ministry of Justice and to the Public Prosecutor and to the 
Supreme Council of Women, who are studying the cases. However, the facts related in the 
letter of allegations were not precise and did not fully describe the reality. Concerning Ms. 
S.F, it pointed out that she had asked for the restitution of child custody rights and her case 
was to be heard on appeal on 5 September 2006. In this respect, the Government 
considered that the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur came too early, 
highlighting that the case was not closed. Concerning S.L., the Government stated that the 
final ruling was issued in July 2006 and that the couple had come to an agreement. 
Concerning S.I.H., the Government asserted that the ruling was issued on 18 January 2006 
and that none of the parties has appealed the decision. Finally, as far as S.A.A. is concerned, 
it indicated that no complaints have been filed with the police and that because of delays on 
the part of the parties concerned, the Sharia Court could only set the date for the trial on 6 
September 2006. The Government concluded by stating that these cases are based upon 
laws that do not discriminate against women. It stressed that the independence of the 
judiciary was guaranteed in Bahrain.

</b>45. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its cooperation and 
values its efforts to provide in a timely manner substantive information in response to the 
above allegations. The Special Rapporteur wishes to take this opportunity to ask the 
Government to provide answers to the following questions. He would appreciate receiving 
information about the result of the appeal of S.F.j and the decision that has been issed in the 
case of S.A.A. Furthermore, he would like the Government to give some details on the 
agreement between S.L. and her husband. With regard to S.I.H., while taking note of the 
comments made by the Government regarding the court ruling, the Special Rapporteur 
regrets that the Government does not provide specific details on the results of any inquiries 
that may have been carried out in relation to this case to assure him that the presiding judge, 
Hamit Al-Asfur, did not try to pressure her to renounce her right to the custody of her 
children before granting a divorce. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government 
has not provided any answer concerning the case of Z.A. and urges it to do so at the earliest 
possible date, and preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights

</p>
<p>46. On 15 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding 
interference by the executive branch in the judiciary. In his communication he noted that:  
 
 (a) Despite the fact that section 22 of the Constitution provides that the State shall 
ensure the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch of the State, it is reported 
that the judiciary in Bangladesh is subject to interference from the executive branch. 
Judges of subordinate courts and tribunals, who deal with the bulk of the cases in the 
judiciary in Bangladesh, both civil and criminal, are answerable to government ministries. 
In particular, the Courts of Metropolitan Sessions judges and the Courts of Metropolitan 
Magistrates, both criminal courts, are administratively attached to the Ministry of Law and 
the Ministry of Home Affairs, respectively. Furthermore, all magistrates throughout the 
country and in the four metropolitan cities, where they work in Chief Metropolitan 
Magistrate&#8217;s Courts, are allegedly answerable to the local district deputy commissioner. It 
has been reported that those judges discharge dual functions, judicial and executive, being 
also responsible for duties under a range of ministries, including home affairs, finance, 
establishment and law, justice and parliamentary affairs. They are allegedly appointed 
from the administrative services by the public service commission. The Ministry of Law, 
Justice and Parliamentary Affairs oversees the recruitment, posting and promotion of 
judges;  
 
 (b) The lack of independence of the judiciary in Bangladesh stems from some 
constitutional provisions. Articles 95, 96, 115, and 116 enable the executive to interfere in 
the appointment and tenure of judges. Article 96 provides that the President may, by order, 
remove a judge from office. Article 115 provides that appointments of persons to offices in 
the judicial service or as magistrates exercising judicial functions shall be made by the 
President in accordance with rules made by him. Finally, according to article 116, control, 
including the power of posting, promotion and grant of leave and discipline of persons 
employed in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions, shall be 
vested in the President and shall be exercised by him in consultation with the Supreme 
Court. It is of concern that a large number of judges have reportedly been appointed 
without effective consultation with the Chief Justice, and that 19 judges at the High Court 
Division of the Supreme Court were reportedly appointed only three days before the annual 
vacation in August 2005. It is alleged that the 19 judges were appointed without properly 
assessing the qualifications, experience and suitability of the candidates. It has also been 
reported that some of the appointees lack seniority and the necessary experience;  
 
 (c) He had been informed that since 1991, the major political parties, including 
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), promised in public meetings that they would 
separate the judiciary from the executive. This was even included in the BNP electoral 
programme. The separation of the judiciary was one of the main election pledges made by 
the BNP-led four-party alliance during the last general election, held in 2001.  However, 
after winning the election and despite having a two-thirds majority in the Parliament, 
which enables a political party to make amendments to the Constitution, the BNP did not 
proceed to the separation of the judiciary from the executive. The Special Rapporteur 
recalled that the separation of the judiciary from the executive is spelled out in point XVII 
of the human rights pledges made by the Government of Bangladesh to the United Nations </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 35 
</p>
<p>on 13 April 2006 in support of its candidatcy for membership in the Human Rights 
Council; 
 
 (d) In a judgement by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on 2 December 
1999, in the case <i>The State </i>v<i>. Mr. Mazdar Hossain</i>, the Supreme Court gave a 12-point 
order to the Government asking it to separate the judiciary, and to establish a judicial 
service commission to appoint judges and deal with promotions, transfers, leave, pensions, 
etc. It has been reported that the Government requested an extension for the 
implementation of the decision and that the Supreme Court has accepted at least 23 other 
extensions to delay the enforcement of this order. However, it is reported that on 5 January 
2006, the Supreme Court rejected a further request for an extension and called for the 
separation of the judiciary to be implemented. A contempt of court case has been opened 
against the Government over its failure to implement the 1999 order. Nevertheless, it has 
been reported that the Government has not yet implemented the decision.  
</p>
<p> 
47. On 31 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences concerning Atiur Rahman, a lawyer, his wife, S.S.S., and his legal assistant, 
Nawsher Ahmed. According to the information received, on 12 March 2006, Ms. S.S.S 
was taken into custody and beaten by the police in Dhaka. She was pregnant at the time, but 
has since lost her child. She filed a complaint together with her husband against the police 
officers. Since then, she and her husband have received threats. In particular, on 24 May 
2006, Mr. Rahman was stopped by a group of armed and unidentified persons. The 
attackers held a pistol to his chest, questioned him about his identity and threatened to 
shoot him. That same morning, while Mr. Rahman&#8217;s legal assistant, Mr. Ahmed, went to 
collect documents from the record office regarding Ms. S.S.S.&#8217;s court case, three persons 
confronted him and inquired if he worked for Atiur Rahman and where they could find him. 
The men followed him for the rest of the day, trying to prevent him from obtaining the 
documents he required from the record office. On 23 May 2006, an unidentified person 
called Mr. Rahman and warned him against pursuing legal proceedings against the police. 
The caller said that if he did not do this, he and his family would pay the ultimate price.  
</p>
<p> 
48. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
concerning Shah Ams Kibria, a member of the National Parliament. According to the 
information brought to his attention, on 27 January 2005, as Mr. Kibria was leaving a 
meeting in his constituency in north-eastern Bangladesh, grenades exploded, instantly 
killing three persons and injuring many others.  Mr. Kibria was severely injured and died 
on his way to hospital.  In contrast with statements by the Speaker of Parliament that the 
authorities would have provided a helicopter to take him to Dhaka for medical treatment 
had they known of the attack. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that despite 
appeals to the Government to send a helicopter, no such assistance was provided. It is also 
reported that two cases, a murder case under the Penal Code of Bangladesh and an 
explosives case under the Explosive Substance Act, were filed.  In both cases, the police 
investigation has reportedly been closed. An appeal for further investigation, in particular </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 36 
</p>
<p>into the origin of the grenades, was dismissed and the case was reportedly sent to the 
competent tribunal for trial.  In the murder case, on 19 March 2005, 10 persons were 
charged. Eight were arrested, while two absconded. The Special Rapporteur has been told 
that the investigation, which has not been actively pursued since April 2005, is incomplete, 
in particular since it has failed to identify the source of the explosives used in the attack, to 
track the funding for the attack and to ascertain how those who threw the grenades received 
the necessary training.  Moreover, two suspects possibly able to provide information are 
still on the run.  Moreover, it is alleged that on 23 March 2006, four of the suspects (Shahed 
Ali, Joynal Abedin Momen, Zamri Ali and Tajul Islam) confessed to a magistrate but 
applied to a higher court for the retraction of their statements, alleging that they had been 
extracted under torture.  Information according to which a High Court judge ruled that their 
confessions had been obtained under torture, and were therefore invalid, has not been 
confirmed to date.  It is also reported that the main defendant, Abdul Quayum, has also 
alleged that he was framed, tortured, and denied food and medical care, and that on 
16 April 2005, when the police report was being heard by the magistrate, the police refused 
his request to make a voluntary confession before the magistrate in the absence of any 
police officers.  The Special Rapporteur was also told that this may be owing to fear that he 
may incriminate certain powerful individuals. On 30 April 2005, the lawyer for the family 
of Mr. Kibria (the informant) submitted an application for further investigation, which was 
dismissed on 10 May 2005.  An appeal against this decision was subsequently lodged 
before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, and further 
proceedings were later temporarily stayed.  On 21 November 2005, the High Court 
dismissed the appeal, arguing that the proper course of action was to file an application for 
further investigation with the trial court, which was competent to rule on such an order.  An 
appeal lodged against this ruling before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court was 
likewise dismissed, and the case is pending before the Speedy Trial Court.  In the appeal 
against the High Court's decision, the appellant reportedly pointed out that such courts 
were unlikely to order further investigation since they are bound by law to complete 
proceedings within a maximum of 135 working days.  
</p>
<p> 
49. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned at the allegation that high-profile 
politicians may be implicated in the assassination.  In this regard, he has been informed that 
the lack of investigation in the case of Mr. Kibria is in stark contrast to the determined 
efforts by the police to investigate the spate of suicide bombings committed in August 
2005, which included an examination of telephone records to trace the militants' network 
and of the sources of the explosives, detonators and other triggering devices.  He was told 
that Mr. Kibria's family has asked that an international inquiry be carried out into the attack, 
and that the Speaker of the Bangladesh Parliament stated that personnel from the United 
States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Interpol had visited the site of the attack, 
but he was unaware whether they had filed any reports. The Special Rapporteur was also 
told that, while Mr. Kibria's family reportedly complained that they never received any 
official condolence letters, the Speaker of Parliament has a copy of a resolution adopted by 
the National Parliament the day after Mr. Kibria's death and that newspaper clippings 
reported that the President of Bangladesh and the Prime Minister had expressed shock at 
the killing of Mr. Kibria and sent messages of condolence. According to the newspaper 
clippings, the Prime Minister said that it was a duty &quot;to find out the perpetrators and ensure </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 37 
</p>
<p>harsh legal punishment&quot; and that she had directed all concerned agencies &quot;to invest all their 
strength to identify the heinous criminals at any cost and take proper action against them&quot;.  
An incomplete newspaper clipping reporting the reaction of the Secretary-General of the 
Parliament to Mr. Kibria's murder is entitled &quot;International probe, if needed, says Mannan 
Bhuiyan&#8221;. A discussion in the National Parliament about Mr. Kibria's murder is said to 
have been blocked by the parliamentary authorities, which reportedly prompted the current 
boycott of the Parliament by the opposition.  Press reports mention that at a recent meeting 
of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs,  members of the Parliament 
asked that the report of the Judicial Inquiry Commission on the August 2004 attack on 
Sheik Hasina and documents relating to Mr. Kibria's murder be put on the Committee's 
agenda.  The request was reportedly refused by the Chairman, as a result of which 
Mohammed Nasim, a former Home Minister, walked out in protest. The invalidation of the 
confessions of four of the accused has been also brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
attention, raising serious doubts as to the conduct of the investigation and warranting in 
itself a reopening of the investigation. He also underlined the importance of ascertaining 
whether the allegations by the main accused person, Mr. Quayum, that he had been coerced 
and subjected to ill-treatment were being investigated, and also the importance of 
ascertaining the grounds on which Mr. Quayim has been prevented from making a 
confession before the magistrate as he himself had requested.  The Special Rapporteur 
pointed out that the authorities have a duty to carry out a thorough and independent 
investigation into Mr. Kibria's murder, as they did in the case of the August 2005 suicide 
bombings, and noted that the Prime Minister and other officials have called for such 
investigations, indicating the possibility that international experts would be involved.  As 
long as all leads shedding light on Mr. Kibria's murder have not been investigated, the 
investigation cannot be deemed to be complete.  The Special Rapporteur finally insisted 
that the murder of a parliamentarian is a threat to all members of the Parliament concerned 
and to the institution of Parliament as such, and in the final analysis to the people whom it 
represents, and that Parliament should therefore avail itself of its oversight function to 
ensure that the competent authorities comply with their duty to carry out full and effective 
investigations to identify and prosecute those responsible and thus to prevent any repetition 
of such crimes.

50. On 21 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter to the Government 
of Bangladesh jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences concerning S.S.S. According to information received, on 12 
March 2006, several opposition political parties held a demonstration, which moved in the 
direction of the Election Commission office. On the way, at Mirpur Road, between Manik 
Mian Avenue and Road 27 in Dhanmondi Residential Area, the police erected a barricade 
to block the protesters. S.S.S. was in this vicinity at the time as she was going to collect her 
son from a nearby school. At approximately 12.30 p.m., a group of demonstrators 
belonging to an opposition political party passed the school. The police fired tear gas and 
water canons at the demonstrators and beat them with sticks, canes and iron rods. S.S.S., 
who had been waiting in front of the school, took shelter inside a private hospital opposite 
the school. Police forcibly removed her from the clinic and placed her with the arrested 
demonstrators. S.S.S. told the police that she was pregnant and a diabetic. The Deputy </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 38 
</p>
<p>Commissioner of Police (West Zone), Kohinoor Mian, reportedly accused her of lying. 
The Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Zone), Mazaharul Haque, and Deputy 
Commissioner Mian allegedly ordered their subordinates to break S.S.S.&#8217;s hands and legs. 
Male police officers placed their hands on Santa&#8217;s lower abdomen to check whether she 
was pregnant. They tied a rope around her abdomen and forcefully pulled on both ends of 
the rope. Thereafter they forced her into a prison van. Inside the van, policemen walked on 
her body and kicked her genitalia as well as her lower abdomen. After S.S.S. fainted she 
was thrown out on the street. S.S.S. suffered severe injuries to her thighs, lower abdomen, 
back, waist, hip and other areas of her body. She also suffered two fractures, one in her 
right elbow and the other in the little finger of her right hand. She lodged a complaint 
against the alleged perpetrators at Mohammadpur police station but the police refused to 
record the case. On 14 March 2006, she filed a case (CR case No. 312/06) with the Chief 
Metropolitan Magistrate&#8217;s Court in Dhaka against Deputy Commissioner Mazharul Haque, 
Deputy Commissioner Kohinur Mian, police constable Ruhul Amin and a number of other 
police officers under the Penal Code. On 19 March, S.S.S. filed a second case (No. 23/06) 
against the alleged perpetrators under sections 10/30 of the Women and Child Repression 
Prevention (Special Provision) (Amended) Act 2003. According to the latest information 
received, neither case has led to a conviction of any of the alleged perpetrators. Over recent 
months, unknown perpetrators have on several occasions threatened S.S.S. and her 
husband, Atiur Rahman, who is also her lawyer, with death if they continue to pursue 
criminal action against the alleged perpetrators.

<p>51. On 8 December 2006 the Government replied to the allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the 2 June 2006 concerning Shah Ams Kibria. The Government reported 
that thorough investigations were conducted by the concerned authorities of Bangladesh on 
the allegation of improper investigation of the murder of Mr. Kibria, former Finance 
Minister and Member of Parliament. On 27 January 2005, Mr. Kibria attended a public 
meeting at Baeddyer Bazaar, Government Primary School premises in Hobiganj. At the 
end of the meeting, as he was leaving the meeting place, unknown persons detonated a 
grenade, causing injury to Mr. Kibria along with 67 others. Three people died on the spot 
and Mr. Kibria was sent to the BIRDEM Hospital in Dhaka where the duty doctor 
pronounced him dead. The incident was a crime resulting in deaths, perpetrated by local 
criminals. The Government immediately responded to the incident, taking all possible 
legal steps. A team, lead by the officer in charge of Hobiganj Police Station, performed an 
investigation of the place of occurrence consisting of interviews and forensics 
investigation. The scene was also visited by Deputy Inspector General of Police Sylhet 
Range and members of the Rapid Action Battalion during the night of the incident. The 
Public Prosecutor at Hobiganj sentenced (1) AKM Abdul Quiyum, (2) Joynal Abedin Jalal, 
(3) Md. Zamir Ali, (4) Joynal Abedin Momin alias Md. Momin Ali, (5) Tajul Islam, (6) Md. 
Sahed Ali alias Shoudu Miah, (7) Md. Selim Ahmmad, (8) Md. Ayet Ali, (9) Md. Mohibur 
Rahman and (10) Md. Kajal Miah as the prima facie charges were proved against them. Of 
the accused Nos. 9 and 10 have absconded, while the remaining eight are in jail. Four of 
them have confessed their involvement in the murder along with six others. The charges in </p>

</p>
<p>relation to the Explosive Substances Act were submitted by the officer in charge of 
Hobiganj Police Station on 19 April 2005 against the above eight arrested persons and the 
two absconding accused persons. Both cases are under trial before the Speedy Trial 
Tribunal, Sylhet. The accused Shahed Ali, Tazul Islam, Zamir Ali and Zainal Abedin filed 
a written petition to the High Court stating that their confessions were involuntary and that 
they had been forced to confess. The High Court asked the trial court to allow them to 
submit a request to the latter for a retraction of the statements, but this was denied. Earlier, 
the complainant, Advocate Abdul Majid Khan, filed an objection petition with the lower 
court stating that the investigation was not proper and asking for a reinvestigation. But the 
court rejected his request, so the complainant submitted this request to the High Court, 
which told Mr. Khan to forward the petition to the trial court. He filed an appeal to the 
Appellation Division of the Supreme Court. On 17 July 2006, the Appellation Division 
ordered a stay of all proceedings in both cases for three months. 
 
52. On 7 June 2006, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteurs, stating that the 
contents of the communications of 21 May 2006 and 2 June 2006 had been duly noted and 
forwarded to the authorities concerned in Bangladesh for necessary further action as 
deemed appropriated.

53. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for its response of 8 
December 2006. The Special Rapporteur is, however, concerned at the absence of reply to 
its communications of 31 May and 21 July and urges the Government to provide at the 
earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human 
Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations. He also hopes to 
receive soon a response to his allegation letter of 15 December 2006, which raises 
important questions concerning structural problems affecting the independence of the 
judiciary in Bangladesh.

Belarus, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or

experts received new information according to which hundreds opposition supporters 
continue to be detained in Minsk after having been arrested by police during the protest 
actions that took place on 24 and 25 March 2006. Presidential candidate Alexander 
Kozulin and members of his family were arrested during the forcible dispersal of a 
peaceful rally on Freedom Day, protesting the outcomes of the recent presidential election 
but also commemorating the anniversary of the 1918 Declaration of Independence of the 
Republic of Belarus. Mr. Kouzolin has reportedly been charged with hooliganism. His </p>

in Akrestsin Street; in the prison located in Valadarski Street; and in a detention centre 
located in Zhodzina. Injured people are detained in hospitals in Minsk. It was alleged that 
Syarhei Atroshchnka (Sergei Otroshchenko), who had been taken to Minsk Hospital 
Number 4 in grave condition after being injured during the march, was taken from the 
hospital to an undisclosed location. His whereabouts are unknown. Over 150 persons have 
reportedly already been speedily tried without access to a defence lawyer and more people 
are expected to be taken to the courts in the coming days. Grave concerns are expressed 
regarding the violation of their right to a fair trial. Family members of the detained cannot 
get information on the whereabouts of their relatives. Concern has been expressed that 
these persons may be subjected to ill-treatment. </p>

</b>56. On 10 January 2006 the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 16 November 2005 regarding the lawyer and human rights activist 
Mrs. Vera Stremkovskaya. With a view to preventing delays and disruptions in the conduct 
of investigations into the criminal case, the Republican Bar Association recommended that 
the director of the Minsk City Bar Association should, as a temporary arrangement, cease 
to grant lawyers ordinary and special leave from 28 October 2005 for a period of one 
month (until the lawyers finished the task of studying the materials of the criminal case 
regarding the members of the S.P. Morozov criminal organization, which required a large 
number of lawyers). In this connection the acting Chairman of the Board of the Minsk City 
Bar Association took the appropriate decision on 28 October 2005 to stop the granting of 
leave. On 31 October 2005 the Board of the Minsk City Bar Association received an 
application from V.V. Stremkovskaya, a lawyer of the Pervomaysky district legal 
consultancy office, to be granted leave for family reasons from 2 to 5 November 2005.  The 
Chairman of the Board of the Minsk City Bar Association refused V.V. Stremkovskaya 
leave, making reference to the above-mentioned Bar Association decision of 28 October 
2005. Lawyer V.V. Stremkovskaya did not submit an application for leave to participate in 
an international conference. During her work in the Minsk City Bar Association V.V. 
Stremkovskaya repeatedly made applications to be granted short-term leave for family 
reasons and not once had she requested leave for the purpose of &#8220;participation in 
international conferences&#8221;, as stated in the communication of the Special Rapporteurs. In 
addition, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that lawyers of the Republic of 
Belarus take an active part in international conferences at the invitation of various 
international organizations.  The Minsk City Bar Association did not receive an invitation 
for V.V. Stremkovskaya to participate in the international conference on the &#8220;Role of 
defence lawyers in guaranteeing a fair trial&#8221; (3-4 November 2005, Tbilisi). It should be 
mentioned that three lawyers from Belarus did participate in that international conference 
in Tbilisi, namely: A.G. Larin, Chairman of the Board of the Mogilev Bar Association, L.I. 
Vinokurtseva, a lawyer of the legal consultation office in the town of Bobruisk, Mogilev 
oblast, and P.V. Sopelko, a lawyer of legal consultation office No. 2 in the Sovetsky district 
of Minsk.

<p>58. On 7 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
concerning Maria Aparecida Denadai, a lawyer in the State of Espirito Santo. Maria 
Aparecida Denadai was previously the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Representative on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on 14 June 2002. Maria Aparecida Denadai 
has been receiving persistent death threats in recent months and has also been the subject of 
intimidation as a result of the investigation surrounding the killing of her brother, lawyer 
Marcelo Denadai, in 2002 while he was preparing to reveal evidence of political corruption. 
Another five witnesses in the case have also been killed. In January 2006, the Federal 
Police began to provide Ms. Aparecida Denadai and her family with protection after her 
case was submitted to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. According to 
new information received, it is reported that on 24 February 2006, the protection provided 
by the Federal Police was withdrawn without explanation. Concern is expressed that the 
threats against Maria Aparecida Denadai are connected with her activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular her investigation into the death of her brother. Serious concerns 
are expressed for her safety in view of the withdrawal of protection measures. <b>

<p> 
59. On 28 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children concerning 
Brazilian workers who are trafficked and subjected to forced labour in the Amazon region. 
According to the information received, there are an estimated 25,000-40,000 forced 
labourers working under exploitative and often slavery-like conditions in Brazil. Allegedly, 
Maranh&#227;o, Piau&#237; and Tocantins are the three Brazilian states that supply the largest number 
of forced labourers, whilst Par&#225; is reportedly the state with the greatest demand for forced 
labour, followed by Mato Grosso, Tocantins and Maranh&#227;o. It is reported that the main 
activities employing forced labour are ranching, deforestation, agriculture, logging and 
charcoal production. Reportedly, the vast majority of workers in forced labour in Brazil 
find themselves in situations of debt bondage. Workers are often given an advance in their 
home towns and persuaded to go work temporarily in the Amazon region. Once they arrive 
at the farms they are told that they will have to pay for their transport, food and lodging and 
also have to pay back any advances they have been given. They are reportedly charged a 
very high rate of interest and often have to buy everything they need at grossly inflated 
prices from the estate shop. It is also reported that workers are often watched by armed 
guards, making it impossible for them to escape from the farms. Threats of violence against 
them and their families are frequent. Labour rights and safety regulations are reportedly 
routinely ignored. Allegedly, workers risk their physical and psychological health, with 
many suffering from tropical diseases and work-related injuries resulting from operating 
unsafe machinery. The severity of their situation often leads to alcohol and drug abuse. 
Many workers, once released, find it extremely difficult to reintegrate into their home 
region and re-establish a normal family life. According to the information received, greater 
attention to the problem of forced labour and slavery-like conditions in Brazil has been 
accompanied by a rise in the use of violence and intimidation against those working to stop 
such human rights violations, especially in the States of Par&#225; and Tocantins. In 2004, 
members of the Comiss&#227;o Pastoral da Terra from the Araguaina office in Tocantins State 
had to leave the area after receiving repeated death threats. Reportedly, state officials have </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 43 
</p>
<p>also been targeted. In October 2003, Labour Court Judge Dr. Jorge Ant&#244;nio Ramos Vieira 
had to leave Parauapebas after receiving repeated threats. On 11 February 2004, his deputy 
was killed in a supicious collision with a lorry while travelling from Maraba to 
Parauapebas. In Tocantins State, the federal prosecutor, Dr. Mario L&#250;cio de Avelar, had to 
leave the town of Palmas after receiving threats. On 28 January 2004, three officials from 
the Labour Ministry and their driver were murdered while carrying out investigations of 
farms situated in Minas Gerais. 
</p>
<p><b>

requesting information on the actions taken to follow up on the recommendations listed in 
the report on his mission to Brazil (E/CN.4/2005/60/Add.3 and Corr.1), as well as other 
more general information on the progress made in the country in relation to matters 
pertaining to his mandate.

Special Rapporteur on 4 March 2005 regarding the murder of Sister Dorothy Stang,<b> </b>an 
environmentalist, human rights defender and member of the Pastoral Land Commission 
(Comiss&#227;o Pastoral da Terra).  The Government reported that on 10 December 2005, the 
Justice of the State of Par&#225; sentenced the two perpetrators of the murder of Sister Stang. 
Rayfran de Neves Sales, alias Fogoi&#243;, to 27 years of imprisonment and Clodoaldo Carlos 
Batista, alias Eduardo, to 17 years of imprisonment. The two farmers who allegedly gave 
the order to kill Sister Stang, Vitalmiro Bastos and Regivaldo Galv&#227;o, and the one who is 
suspected of having acted as intermediary, Amair Frejoli da Cunha, alias Tato, will face 
trial next year. The Brazilian Government hailed the trial of the killers of Sister Stang as an 
important, but initial step towards ending impunity in the State of Par&#225;.

62. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply of 25 January 2006 and 
notes with satisfaction that the perpetrators of the murder of Sister Dorothy Stang have 
been tried and convicted, and that the persons who ordered the murder will be tried. He 
would appreciate receiving further information on those trials. The Special Rapporteur 
regrets, however, that he has not received any official reply to the communications he sent 
in 2006, including on the follow-up to his report on his visit to the country. He urges the 
Government of Brazil to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end 
of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive answer to the 
above communications.  
</p>
<p> 
63. With regard to lawyer Maria Aparecida Denadai, the Special Rapporteur had the 
pleasure to receive information from a non-governmental source indicating that on 21 June

Police, and was no longer in immediate danger.

Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, an 
allegation letter concerning a number of lawyers who intended to participate in an 
international law training course. According to the information received, Ky Tech, 
President of the Cambodian Bar Association, has threatened lawyers who cooperate in the 
organization of or participate in a five-day training course on international criminal law, 
organized by the Defence Office of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia 
(ECCC) and the International Bar Association (IBA). The training was scheduled to be 
held from 27 November to 1 December 2006. It is alleged that the President of the 
Cambodian Bar Association has stated that this training is not in compliance with 
Cambodian law and that in order to avoid problems with politics and interference with the 
independence of the Bar Association, lawyers should not participate in this training. The 
President of the Cambodian Bar Association has described those lawyers who cooperate in 
the organization of the training as &quot;extremists&quot; and warned that measures will be taken 
against those who conspire to violate the law. It is also reported that the President of the 
Bar Association has stated that the Bar Association has full and exclusive authority to 
approve all training of Cambodian lawyers within the Kingdom of Cambodia. However, it 
is reported that the Bar Association Law states that the Bar has exclusive control of the 
specific professional training undertaken by those seeking to be called to the Bar and 
continuing education for those who fail to meet the standard. This control would therefore 
be limited to the specific training relating to the qualifications to become a member of the 
Bar and practise, while training such as that organized by the ECCC and IBA would not 
appear to fall into the framework of this law. Concerns have been expressed that the 
alleged statements made by the President of the Cambodian Bar Association may deter, 
intimidate and prevent lawyers from participating in this legitimate training exercise in 
international criminal law.

73. El 11 de mayo de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente junto con el 
Relator Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n, la Representante Especial del 
Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos humanos, el Relator Especial sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, el 
Relator Especial sobre formas contempor&#225;neas de racismo, discriminaci&#243;n racial, 
xenofobia y formas conexas de intolerancia y el Experto Independiente sobre la protecci&#243;n 
de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en la lucha contra el terrorismo, 
respecto a la situaci&#243;n de Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo 
Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil, l&#237;deres y simpatizantes mapuches condenados a 
m&#225;s de 10 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n bajo la acusaci&#243;n de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221;. La situaci&#243;n de las 
personas mencionadas hab&#237;a sido objeto de una comunicaci&#243;n personal enviada por el 
Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales de 
los ind&#237;genas a la Presidenta Sra. Michelle de Bachelet, el d&#237;a 21 de abril de 2006. 
Asimismo, con anterioridad el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos 
y libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas hab&#237;a enviado comunicaciones a su Gobierno 
expresando su preocupaci&#243;n por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista a presos mapuches, 
por hechos relacionados con la lucha social por la tierra, as&#237; como con los leg&#237;timos 
reclamos ind&#237;genas. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, y referida en la comunicaci&#243;n 
anteriormente citada, en agosto de 2004 Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, Jaime 
Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil habr&#237;an sido condenados a penas de diez 
a&#241;os y un d&#237;a de prisi&#243;n despu&#233;s de haber sido acusados del delito de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221;, 
bajo la Ley Antiterrorista 18.314, por un incendio causado en el predio conocido como 
Poluco Podenco. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el juicio habr&#237;a presentado 
irregularidades y las declaraciones de los testigos habr&#237;an presentado contradicciones. </p>

</p>
<p>Actualmente, los se&#241;ores Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo 
Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil se encontrar&#237;an en la ciudad del Angol y desde el 
13 de marzo de 2006 mantendr&#237;an la huelga de hambre en protesta por las fuertes condenas 
recibidas y por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista (que se utiliza con frecuencia en 
relaci&#243;n con las reclamaciones agrarias y las reclamaciones para pedir un nivel de vida 
adecuado de los mapuches), habi&#233;ndose deteriorado gravemente su estado de salud tras 
m&#225;s de 55 d&#237;as de huelga de hambre. Se nota con mucha preocupaci&#243;n que los jueces 
habr&#237;an aplicado la ley de manera discriminatoria; mientras que por los delitos contra la 
propiedad se aplican generalmente multas o penas de prisi&#243;n muy cortas, en el caso de los 
mapuches los jueces calificar&#237;an estos mismos delitos como actos de terrorismo y 
aplicar&#237;an penas de prisi&#243;n muy severas, de por lo menos diez a&#241;os. Se expresan graves 
temores de que el uso de la ley Antiterrorista en el caso anteriormente mencionado pueda 
estar relacionado con sus actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular 
por sus actividades en defensa de la comunidad Mapuche. Adem&#225;s, se expresan graves 
temores de que la situaci&#243;n de extrema fragilidad de las personas anteriormente 
mencionadas pueda acarrear da&#241;os irreversibles para su salud f&#237;sica y ps&#237;quica y pueda 
poner en peligro sus vidas.

<p> 
74. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 23 de mayo del 2006, el Gobierno de Chile proporcion&#243; 
informaci&#243;n con respecto al llamamiento enviado el 11 de mayo. Indic&#243; que los hechos por 
los que fueron condenados los Sres. Juan Patricio Marileo Saravia, Juan Huenulao Lienmil 
y Florencio Jaime Marileo Saravia y la Sra. Patricia Troncoso Robles, se encontraban 
previamente tipificados como delitos en la ley penal y en la ley antiterrorista, al igual que 
sus penas (pena estipulada para el delito de incendio). Indic&#243; que se trata del incendio de 
los fundos Poluco y Pidenco, ubicados en la Provincia de Malleco, Comuna de Ercilla (IX 
Region), propiedad de la empresa forestal MININCO S.A., que ocasion&#243; un da&#241;o cercano a 
los US$600.000 d&#243;lares. El Gobierno declar&#243; que se cumplieron los principios del debido 
proceso. Afirm&#243; que los inculpados, de acuerdo con lo dispuesto en el Art. 19, No 3 de la 
Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica, contaron con defensa jur&#237;dica desde el inicio mismo de la causa, la 
que fue proporcionada por la Defensor&#237;a Penal P&#250;blica. Aleg&#243; que hicieron uso de los 
recursos que proporciona la ley para impugnar las resoluciones judiciales: recurso de 
nulidad, de amparo y revisi&#243;n. En lo que se refiere a la invocaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista, el 
Gobierno indic&#243; que en el caso concreto del delito de incendio, la pena que establece el 
C&#243;digo Penal es tan grave como la de la Ley Antiterrorista. Se&#241;al&#243; sin embargo que<b> </b>la 
Presidenta de la Republica, Sra. Michelle Bachelet, se ha comprometido a que el ejecutivo, 
en hechos futuros que se encuentren tipificados como delitos por la Ley Antiterrorista y 
que puedan ser juzgados por la ley com&#250;n, cuando en estos se vean involucrados ind&#237;genas 
en procesos de reivindicaciones de tierras, no invocar&#225; la aplicaci&#243;n de dicha ley, al hacer 
la denuncia o querella que corresponda ante la justicia. El Gobierno inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que 
un proyecto de ley fue presentado por<b> </b>los Senadores Alejandro Navarro y Jaime Naranjo 
con el objeto de modificar el Decreto Ley No 321 sobre libertad condicional. El proyecto 
establece la posibilidad de otorgar la libertad condicional a los condenados a penas 
privativas de libertad por delitos contemplados en la Ley. 18.3 14 (Ley Antiterrorista), y 
condenados por delitos sancionados en otros cuerpos legales, en causas relacionadas con </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 48 
</p>
<p>reivindicaciones violentas de derechos consagrados en la Ley 19.253 (Ley Ind&#237;gena), 
siempre que los hechos punibles hayan ocurrido entre el 1 de enero de 1997 y el 1 de enero 
de 2006, y los condenados suscriban en forma previa una declaraci&#243;n inequ&#237;voca y 
favorable al no uso de la violencia en la reivindicaci&#243;n de derechos establecidos en la ley 
19.253 y en el derecho internacional de los pueblos ind&#237;genas. Asimismo, el Gobierno 
se&#241;al&#243; que el 15 de mayo de 2006, el Ministro del Interior comunic&#243; que el gobierno hab&#237;a 
puesto &quot;suma urgencia&quot; a la tramitaci&#243;n del Proyecto de Ley para modificar el Decreto Ley 
32 1. El Gobierno indic&#243; que con motivo de la presentaci&#243;n de este proyecto de ley y la 
suma urgencia que le otorg&#243; el gobierno, con fecha 14 de mayo actual, los afectados 
depusieron temporalmente la huelga de hambre, a la espera de los resultados de la 
tramitaci&#243;n del proyecto de ley se&#241;alado precedentemente. 
 
75. El Gobierno insisti&#243; en que m&#225;s all&#225; del caso espec&#237;fico de estas personas, se debe 
contextualizar que esta situaci&#243;n no responde a una persecuci&#243;n pol&#237;tica hacia el 
movimiento ind&#237;gena o mapuche. Se&#241;al&#243; que en la actualidad existen nueve personas de 
ascendencia ind&#237;gena condenadas por la Ley Antiterrorista, que la aplicaci&#243;n de esta ley 
fue s&#243;lo invocada frente a situaciones de extrema gravedad, tal como fue, la ofensiva de los 
sectores minoritarios ligados a la reivindicaci&#243;n de derechos territoriales ind&#237;genas, 
iniciada a partir del a&#241;o 1999, y destinada a ejecutar acciones contra empresas forestales y 
agricultores en algunas provincias de las regiones VI11 y IX. Igualmente, el Gobierno 
insisti&#243; en el hecho de que las acciones judiciales iniciadas estuvieron encaminadas a 
castigar a los autores de delitos y no al pueblo mapuche y a sus reivindicaciones sociales. 
Afirm&#243; que el Estado de Chile ha reconocido como leg&#237;tima la demanda de los pueblos 
ind&#237;genas, y que dicha demanda ha sido permanentemente asumida por los Gobiernos 
democr&#225;ticos y encauzada por mecanismos y canales institucionales. En este sentido, 
indic&#243; que la protecci&#243;n al derecho a la tierra se encuentra consagrada por la Ley Ind&#237;gena 
No 19.253 desde 1993, lo que ha permitido traspasar a la fecha aproximadamente 400.000 
hect&#225;reas de tierra a m&#225;s de 500 comunidades a lo largo de todo el pa&#237;s. Sin embargo, el 
Gobierno afirm&#243; que no pod&#237;a bajo circunstancia alguna, revisar, modificar o anular el 
fallo judicial, citando el art&#237;culo 73 de la Constituci&#243;n, seg&#250;n el cual el Presidente de la 
Rep&#250;blica ni el Congreso pueden, en caso alguno, ejercer las funciones judiciales, avocarse 
a causas pendientes, revisar los fundamentos o contenidos de sus resoluciones, o hacer 
revivir procesos fenecidos.

76. El Relator especial agradece al Gobierno de Chile su grata cooperaci&#243;n y la brevedad

compromiso de la Presidenta de la Rep&#250;blica, la Sra. Michelle Bachelet, as&#237; como el 
proyecto de ley presentado por los Senadores Alejandro Navarro y Jaime Naranjo, el cual 
tiene como objeto modificar el Decreto Ley No 321 sobre libertad condicional, que a su 
vez modificar&#237;a la Ley sobre Conductas Terroristas y podr&#237;a permitir la libertad 
condicional a los presos mencionados en el llamamiento urgente. El Relator solicita al 
Gobierno que por favor le env&#237;e informaciones sobre el progreso en la adopci&#243;n de dicho 
proyecto.

<p><b>Communications sent </b> 
 
77. On 6 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
concerning Gao Zhisheng, lawyer and director of the Shengzi Law Office in Beijing, and 
Yang Maodong, also known as Guo Feixiong, lawyer in the Shengzi Law Office in Beijing. 
Gao Zhisheng was the subject of previous communications sent by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 25 November 2005, and 
by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers on 21 December 2005. According to the 
allegations received, at around 10.30 p.m. on 17 January 2006, Gao Zhisheng was driving 
in Beijing when a car travelling in front of him stopped suddenly, and he narrowly avoided 
colliding with it. According to Gao Zhisheng, the car in front had its licence plates covered 
with newspaper.  As he got out of his car, the car in front of him started moving towards 
him, forcing him to jump out of its path in order to save himself from being run over.  A 
military vehicle had been following behind his car, also with covered licence plates, 
leading Gao Zhisheng to believe that the incident was instigated by the authorities. Both 
vehicles left the scene immediately after the incident.  Gao Zhisheng has been working on 
a number of high-profile cases, including a land dispute case in Taishi village. Yang 
Maodong has been providing legal assistance to villagers in Taishi, Guandong Province, in 
a local corruption case. It is reported that on 4 February 2006 he was detained in Linbe 
Police Station in Guangzhou for 12 hours after visiting Taishi village with another lawyer, 
Tang Jingling. On their release, they were reportedly beaten by a group of unidentified men. 
It is alleged that on 8 February, Yang Maodong issued an open letter addressed to the 
authorities protesting the excessive use of force in government crackdowns on recent 
demonstrations, forced evictions, violence against human rights lawyers and tightening of 
media censorship. He began a hunger strike, with the support of Gao Zhisheng, to pressure 
the authorities to engage a dialogue with villagers in order to avoid escalation of rural land 
disputes and to guarantee local democracy. It is alleged that Yang Maodong was 
immediately arrested without being informed of the charges. It is reported that Yang 
Maodong was released on 9 February. Nevertheless, it would appear that since then he and 
his family have been under permanent surveillance. It is alleged that between 9 and 13 
February, 20 policemen were on guard in front of his house. It would appear that seven of 
them are still there. It is alleged that the policemen follow Yang Maodong, his wife and 
their children every time they go out. 
</p>
<p> 
78. On 7 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-educated lawyer. Chen Guangcheng 
was already the subject of a communication sent on 31 October 2005 by the Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 50 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, and of a communication sent on 19 September 
2005 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders. The experts are also in receipt of the Government&#8217;s reply dated 12 
December 2005, which states that Chen Guangchen is suspected of having violated article 
111 of the Chinese Criminal Code by contacting illegal overseas organizations and 
receiving funding from them. He is, therefore, according to the Government&#8217;s reply, under 
Public Security Bureau investigation, and the various forms of deprivation of his freedom 
alleged cannot be considered arbitrary. While the experts welcome the Government&#8217;s 
observations, they do not alleviate concerns with respect to this case, particularly in the 
light of more recent reports with regard to Chen Guangchen&#8217;s access to legal counsel. As 
already stated in previous communications, it is alleged that on 6 September 2005 Chen 
Guancheng was arrested in Beijing by police from Shandong Province, in order to prevent 
him from getting advice from lawyers on the accusations against him related to his 
campaign against the use of forced sterilization and abortion in the city of Linyi. It is 
reported that the local police took him back to Linyi and placed him under house arrest the 
following day, and that since then his house has been surrounded by up to 50 men and 
many cars, his telephone land line and mobile phone have been cut off and his computer 
seized. It is reported that on 4 October 2005, law lecturer Xu Zhiyong and lawyers Li 
Fangping and Li Subin attempted to visit him and tried to negotiate with local officials to 
have his house arrest lifted, but they were stopped on their way to the house. However, Mr. 
Chen reportedly managed to leave his house and speak with them briefly, but was then 
forcibly taken back. The lawyers tried to go to Mr. Chen&#8217;s house, but they were stopped 
and reportedly beaten up and taken to a police station where they were interrogated. They 
were told that the case now involved &#8220;State secrets&#8221; and were escorted back to Beijing. On 
10 October 2005, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s cousin, Chen Guangli, and another villager also 
surnamed Chen, who had been giving interviews about Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s situation to 
foreign reporters, were reportedly detained.  It is alleged that on 24 October, two other 
Beijing scholars and friends of Chen Guangcheng went to visit him.  As Mr. Chen ran out 
to greet them, he was stopped and beaten by more than 20 men stationed outside. Lawyer 
Teng Biao reportedly filed a lawsuit on Mr. Chen&#8217;s behalf regarding this incident before 
the People&#8217;s Court of Yinan Country. However, the court has reportedly so far ignored the 
suit. 
</p>
<p> 
79. According to information received since the Government&#8217;s reply, on 2 February 2006 a 
neighbour of Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s, Chen Hua, walked past Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s house and 
protested his detention to the policemen standing guard in front. As a result, he was beaten. 
It is reported that on 4 February 2006, Chen Hua was arrested and has not been allowed to 
contact his lawyer. Moreover, it is reported that on 11 March 2006, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s 
neighbour and cousin, Chen Guangyu, was beaten by four hooded men who were waiting 
for him near his home. It is reported that when Chen Guangcheng discovered this, he left 
his house with another villager, Chen Guangjun, for the Yinan Local Government office to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 51 
</p>
<p>request an investigation into the beating. It is alleged that when they were a few metres 
from the house, the three men were arrested by officers of the Yinan Public Security 
Bureau and taken to the local police station. It is reported that their families were notified 
that they would be detained for 24 hours in order to investigate their participation in an 
offence called &#8220;blocking traffic&#8221;. However, it is alleged that they are still detained. Finally, 
it is reported that Chen Guangcheng has not been allowed to contact his lawyer or his 
family since his detention on 11 March 2006. Finally, it is alleged that law lecturer Xu 
Zhiyong and lawyers Li Fangping and Li Subin, who were asked for legal advice by Chen 
Guangcheng in cases related to forced sterilization and abortion policies in Linyi, are as a 
result now under significant pressure from the authorities and their employers.  
</p>
<p> 
80. On 22 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression concerning Zhao Yan, news assistant at the Beijing bureau of <i>The</i> <i>New York 
Times</i> and former reporter for <i>China Reform</i> magazine. Zhao Yan was the subject of a 
communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
to which the Government has replied. According to new information received, he was tried 
behind closed doors at Beijing People's Intermediate Court No.2 on 16 June 2006. It is 
reported that the trial lasted for only a few hours without witnesses being questioned and 
only a few documents being read. Zhao Yan&#8217;s sister and foreign journalists were not 
allowed to attend the trial. The court has not given its verdict. He is facing charges of 
involvement in illegally divulging State secrets abroad, according to the Government's 
reply. The charges are reportedly linked with the publication of an article in <i>The</i> <i>New York 
Times</i> on 7 September 2004 revealing Jiang Zemin's plan to retire from the position of 
Chairman of the Central Military Commission and the transfer of leadership to President 
Hu Jintao. This article preceded the official announcement of Mr. Jiang's retirement. 
</p>
<p> 
81. On 14 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
concerning Chen Guangcheng, a lawyer and human rights defender in Linyi, Shandong 
Province, and Guo Qizhen, a volunteer in the Tianwang Disappeared Persons Service 
Centre in Cangzhou City, Hebei Province. The Tianwang Disappeared Persons Service 
Centre assists relatives of missing persons to publicize their stories on the Internet in order 
to find their relatives. Mr. Chen was already the subject of several previous 
communications (see above). According to the information received, on 12 May 2006 Mr. 
Guo was placed under house arrest by local security forces while he was participating in a 
hunger strike to protest alleged human rights violations committed by the Chinese 
authorities. On 6 June 2006 Mr. Guo was reportedly charged with &#8220;inciting subversion of 
State power&#8221; and is currently being held in the Cangzhou City No. 2 Detention Centre in 
Cangzhou City. On 10 June 2006, Chen Guangcheng was charged with &#8220;deliberate 
destruction of property&#8221; and &#8220;organizing a mob to disrupt traffic&#8221;, allegedly after he had 
spent 89 days in incommunicado detention in the Yinan County Detention Centre, where 
he remains. It is reported that he was arrested on 11 March 2006 but that his family was not </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 52 
</p>
<p>informed of his whereabouts until 11 June 2006. It is still unknown whether Mr. Chen has 
finally been allowed to see his lawyer. Concerns are expressed that the charges against 
Chen Guangcheng, and Guo Qizhen are arbitrary and may be related to their activities in 
defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>82. On 20 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding Zheng Enchong, a lawyer who has defended the rights of persons who have been 
displaced and adversely affected by development in Shanghai, and Ms. Jiang Meili, his 
wife. Mr. Zheng and Ms. Jiang were the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
dated 16 March 2004; Ms Jiang was also the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 17 March 2005. According to the information received, on 12 July 2006 at 
approximately 6.30 p.m. Public Security police entered Zheng Enchong's home in 
Shanghai. It is reported that the police officers summoned Jiang Meili to report to the 
police station on suspicion of &#8220;impeding the officials of State organs in the execution of 
their duties&#8221; under section 82 of China's Criminal Procedure Law. It is further reported that 
Mr. Zheng's house was searched and that a computer and documents relating to his work 
were seized, and that a search warrant was only presented after the search. Police officers 
returned to Mr. Zheng&#8217;s home at 10 p.m. on the same day and told him to accompany the 
police officers to the police station, also on suspicion of &#8220;impeding officials of State organs 
in the execution of their duties&#8221;. It is reported that Jiang Meili was permitted to return 
home but that Zheng Enchong remains in custody. Zheng Enchong had been released on 5 
June 2006 after serving a three-year prison sentence for &#8220;illegally providing State secrets 
overseas&#8221;. Concerns are expressed that the above events may be connected with Mr. 
Zheng&#8217;s activities in defence of human rights, in particular his activities as attorney for 
persons who have been displaced and adversely affected by development in Shanghai. 
Further concern is expressed that the charges against him may represent an attempt to 
prevent him from continuing his legitimate work as a lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>83. On 10 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression regarding Zhao Yan, news assistant at the Beijing bureau of <i>The New York 
Times </i>and former reporter for <i>China Reform</i> magazine. The situation of Mr. Zhao was 
already the subject of two urgent appeals: one sent on 1 October 2004 by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and a second one sent on 
22 June 2006 by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression (see above). The Government&#8217;s response to that communication was received 
on 14 July 2006. According to the information received, Mr. Zhao was arrested in Shangai 
on 17 September 2004.  He was charged on 21 September 2004 with &quot;providing State 
secrets to foreigners&quot;, allegations which could lead to a charge of treason, a crime </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 53 
</p>
<p>punishable by execution. His arrest is reportedly linked with the publication of an article in 
<i>The New York Times</i> on 7 September 2004 revealing Jiang Zemin's plan to retire which 
preceded the official announcement, which was made on 19 September 2004. Mr. Zhao 
was tried behind closed doors at Beijing People's Intermediate Court No. 2 on 16 June 2006. 
It is reported that the trial lasted for only a few hours without witnesses being questioned 
and only a few documents being read. Zhao Yan&#8217;s sister and foreign journalists were not 
allowed to attend the trial. No verdict has been announced within the official six-week time 
limit, which expired on 25 July 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
84. On 22 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders concerning Gao Zhisheng, 
aged 42, a human rights lawyer in Beijing. Gao Zhisheng was already the subject of two 
previous communications, one sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers dated 25 November 2005 and one by the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture dated 21 December 2005. According to information received, on 15 August 2006, 
Gao Zhisheng was residing with his sister in the city of Yingshe, Shadong Province. At 
noon, 10 to 12 plain-clothes officers of the Beijing Public Security Bureau entered the 
house and detained him &#8220;for questioning related to his suspected involvement in criminal 
activities&#8221;. It is reported that Mr. Gao had been under strict surveillance by the secret police 
for several months prior to this incident. The day before he was detained, the telephone of 
the house where he was residing was disconnected, as were the phones of many of his 
relatives, who also received warnings from the police. Mr. Gao&#8217;s whereabouts remain 
unknown.. 
</p>
<p> 
85. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders regarding Gao Zhisheng, a lawyer and Director of 
the Shengzhi Law Office in Beijing, his wife G.H., their children, aged 13 and 2, and his 
70-year-old mother-in-law. Gao Zhisheng has represented victims of human rights 
violations; clients who sought to hold the State accountable for corruption and neglect 
including forced evictions; and clients involved in cases related to freedom of speech and 
the press.  He has been the subject of three previous communications, the first sent by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers dated 25 November 
2005; a second communication was subsequently sent by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture on 21 December 2005 and the most recent communication, dated 22 August 2006, 
was sent by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 54 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders (see above). According to 
new information received, on 24 November 2006 G.H. was beaten by members of the State 
Security police who had been following her movements and keeping her under 
surveillance. It is reported that G.H., her 13&#8211;year-old daughter and her mother have been 
constantly followed by police for approximately three months.  The incident reportedly 
took place on a street in Beijing (Jingsong Road, near the Lidu Hotel on bus route 408), 
after G.H. told three police officers (two male, one female) to stop following her and her 
children.  As a result of the beating by the two male police officers, G.H. is reported to have 
loose teeth, a bleeding mouth and gums, a fingernail on one hand completely torn off and 
her leather clothing ripped to pieces. It is further reported that the daughter has also been 
harassed by the State Security Police who accompany her at all times, including while she 
is in school. It is reported that they follow her to her classroom, in the school corridors and 
even to the bathroom, which makes her educational environment difficult. Furthermore, on 
21 November, it is reported that Beijing police showed their badges and attempted to pick 
up the 2-year-old son, but his kindergarten teacher refused to comply. It has also been 
reported that G.H.&#8217;s mother is also followed by police when she leaves the house. On 12 
October 2006, Gao Zhisheng was formally charged with &#8220;inciting to subvert the State&#8221;.  It 
is reported that on 6 October 2006, G.H.&#8217;s birthday, she was allowed to see her husband at 
the Beijing No. 2 Detention Centre where they were watched and interrupted by police 
officers throughout the visit, which lasted for approximately 20 minutes.  However, 
sources indicate that Mr. Gao has still not had access to his lawyer, Mo Shaoping, despite 
the recent discovery of his current whereabouts, as the authorities have reportedly stated 
that his case concerns &#8220;State secrets&#8221;.  Prior to 6 October 2006 Mr. Gao had allegedly been 
held incommunicado since 15 August 2006 when he was arrested without a warrant at his 
sister&#8217;s house in Dongying City in Shandong Province by more than 20 plain-clothes police 
officers from the Beijing Public Security Bureau.  According to reports, the official Xinhua 
News Agency released a statement on 18 August 2006 that Mr. Gao had been arrested &#8220;on 
suspicion of breaking the law&#8221;; however, no details of the alleged crime were provided.  
Concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Gao Zhisheng as it is 
feared that he may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment while in detention.  Concern is 
expressed that the charges against him may be fabricated and may represent an attempt to 
prevent him and deter others from carrying out legitimate legal work in defence of human 
rights. Further concerns are also expressed for the safety of his family, particularly his wife 
and his children, as it is feared that they may be subject to further acts of intimidation, 
harassment or violence because of Mr. Gao&#8217;s human rights work. 
</p>
<p> 
86. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders concerning the enactment of tightened regulations regarding the 
legal profession, procedural obstacles to its exercise and an increase in the harassment of 
lawyers. It is alleged that the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code have been 
misused by authorities to undermine lawyers&#8217; defence work, especially in sensitive 
political or social unrest cases. Article 306 of the Criminal Code, article 96 of the Criminal 
Procedure Law and article 45 of the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Lawyers 
reportedly allow prosecutors to arrest lawyers on grounds of perjury or false testimony. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 55 
</p>
<p>Under these provisions, lawyers can be accused of destroying or fabricating evidence and 
of forcing or inciting a witness to change testimony. These acts are punishable by 
imprisonment for up to seven years and by the revocation of the lawyer&#8217;s licence.  It is 
reported that at least 100 lawyers have been accused of violating the article on the 
fabrication of evidence. These articles are reportedly used by authorities to silence defence 
lawyers. It is also reported that article 96 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which applies to 
State secret cases, compels defendants who wish to be provided and meet with a legal 
counsel to request the approval of the investigative organ, which in general is the public 
security authority. Moreover, both the Law on the Protection of State Secrets and a notice 
issued by the Ministry of Public Security and the National Administration for the 
Protection of State Secrets in 1995 entitled &#8220;Regulation on State secrets and the scope of 
each level of classification in public security work&#8221; contain a definition of &#8220;State secrets&#8221; 
that is excessively broad. Moreover, several restrictive regulations on the legal profession 
have been issued by national and local authorities. On 20 March 2006, the All China 
Lawyers Association (ACLA) issued a &#8220;Guiding opinion on lawyers handling collective 
cases&#8221;, which allegedly aims to ensure that sensitive cases do not threaten social stability. 
According to this text, lawyers taking on collective cases (cases involving more than 10 
people) and &#8220;major sensitive cases&#8221; are required to immediately report to and accept the 
supervision and guidance of judicial administrative organs. Collective cases are reportedly 
linked to land requisitioning, levying of taxes, building demolitions, forced evictions, 
migrants&#8217; enclaves, enterprise transformation, environmental pollution and rural labourers. 
According to the guidelines, only &#8220;politically qualified&#8221; lawyers are allowed to deal with 
these kinds of cases and before accepting them, they need the approval of at least three law 
firm partners. In addition, the guidelines allegedly warn lawyers not to encourage their 
clients to participate, or participate themselves in petitions to government offices and not to 
contact foreign media. Lawyers who violate the guidelines face sanctions.It is also  alleged 
that more restrictive regulations have been issued by local public authorities. These 
regulations are generally called &#8220;Opinions on strengthening the guidance of lawyers 
handling major and collective cases&#8221; and reportedly limit lawyers&#8217; freedom of expression 
because they are not allowed to talk to the media about their views on collective and 
sensitive cases. It is also reported that several procedural obstacles are preventing lawyers 
from performing their duties, in particular conducting investigations and gathering 
evidence. Lawyers are compelled, inter alia, to request authorization from the investigative 
organ to meet their clients in prison and they reportedly have many restrictions on 
photocopying and recording case materials necessary for the defence work. In addition, in 
order to carry out their work lawyers reportedly often need to pay to officials and judges 
&#8220;file retrieval fees&#8221;, &#8220;services fees&#8221; and fees for referrals from judges.  Furthermore, it has 
been reported that ACLA is not independent, since its Secretary-General is also the deputy 
director of the division in charge of lawyers and notaries public in the Ministry of Justice, 
and that its three deputy secretaries worked for the Ministry of Justice just before they 
became ACLA members. Finally, it is alleged that lawyers are being harassed and in some 
cases attacked by authorities because of their professional activities as legal representatives. 
Lawyers have no system of immunity linked to their professional activity. They are 
assimilated to their clients and like the suspects they defend, they are often held in 
prolonged pre-trial detention and have difficulty meeting with their own lawyers. When 
released, they and their families are subjected to intimidation by the authorities. One of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 56 
</p>
<p>consequences of this situation is said to be that some defendants have been unable to find a 
lawyer willing to take their case because of its sensitive nature.   
</p>
<p> 
87. In this context, the experts brought to the attention of the Government the following 
cases of lawyers who have allegedly been victims of intimidation and harassment. 
According to the information received: 
</p>
<p> 
 - Yang Maodong, a lawyer in charge of human rights cases, also known as Guo 
Feixiong, who was the subject of a previous communication by the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers dated 6 March 2006, was detained on 2 August 2006 
after four days of &#8220;disappearance&#8221; following a protest outside the Xinhuamen Gate to the 
central government residential compound in Beijing. On 9 August 2006, he was reportedly 
beaten by the transit police and then taken to Shaoguan, Guangdong Province, where he 
was detained overnight. On 10 August 2006, he was allegedly forcibly sent back home to 
Guangzhou, after being accused by the police of holding a fake train ticket; 
-  On 18 August 2006, the police announced that Gao Zhisheng, a well-known 
human rights lawyer, was arrested &#8220;for suspected involvement in criminal activities&#8221;. Gao 
Zhisheng was already the subject of three communications previously transmitted by 
special procedures dated 25 November 2005, 21 December 2005 and 22 August 2006 (see 
above). Dozens of persons have signed a petition asking for his release. Several of them 
have been reportedly put under house arrest, and his wife and two children allegedly are 
under permanent surveillance and have been harassed by numerous female police officers 
based in front of their home.; 
 - On August 19 2006, the trial of Chen Guangcheng, a well-known human rights 
lawyer in Linyi, Shandong Province, who has been instrumental in highlighting human 
rights violations committed in the course of the implementation of the one child per couple 
policy, reportedly took place without the presence of his legal team, because all of them 
have been either detained by the police or denied access to the court. On 24 August 2006, 
he was sentenced to four years and three months in prison. Moreover, two other lawyers 
associated with Mr. Chen&#8217;s case, Yan Zaixin and Zhang Jiankang, have reportedly been 
harassed and forcibly returned to their home. Chen Guangcheng was already the subject of 
several communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers and other mandate holders on 14 July 2006, 7 April 2006, 31 October 2005 and 19 
September 2005 (see above); On 27 June 2006, Li Jinsong resigned as Chen Guancheng&#8217;s 
chief counsel after reportedly being attacked by 20 men who overturned his car while he 
was inside. On 19 August 2006, Mr. Li and another defence lawyer working on Chen 
Guacheng&#8217;s case, Zhang Lihui, were allegedly denied access to the trial. They were said to 
have been surrounded by police after dinner the night before the trial, allegedly detained 
without charge and then released. Xu Zhiyong, who replaced Li Jinsong in defending Chen 
Guancheng, was allegedly beaten and taken into police custody by unidentified men on 18 
August 2006, the day before Mr. Chen&#8217;s trial began. He was released 22 hours later, after 
the trial had already finished; 
</p>
<p> 
 - Zheng Enchong, a lawyer who deals with human rights cases, served three years 
in prison for &#8220;leaking State secrets abroad&#8221; after he contacted an overseas human rights </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 57 
</p>
<p>group about illegal forced evictions in Shanghai. Released in June 2006, he has since 
reportedly been under virtual house arrest and is alleged to be constantly monitored and 
harassed by the police. Mr. Zheng was the subject of two urgent appeals sent by special 
procedures mandate holders on 16 March 2004 and 20 July 2006 (see above);   
 - Li Baiguang was detained on 14 December 2004, allegedly because he provided 
legal representation to approximately 100,000 peasants seeking damages for forced land 
evictions. It is reported that since his release he has been detained and physically attacked 
several times; 
</p>
<p> 
 - Ma Guanjun, who represented a rape suspect in 2003, was detained and accused 
of &#8220;obstructing justice&#8221;. It is alleged that at the trial he produced seven witnesses who 
testified in favour of his client, but that during the recess, local police officers questioned 
the witnesses and that the witnesses changed their testimony. According to the information 
received, at the retrial, the witnesses testified that the suspect could not have committed the 
rape, but following police interrogation they once again recanted their testimony. 
Afterwards, Ma Guanjun was convicted of violating article 306 of the Criminal Code. He 
served 210 days in prison until a lawyers association launched an investigation into his 
case which led to his release in March 2004. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>88. On the 21 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Chen 
Guangcheng, a 34-year-old blind self-taught human rights lawyer in Linyi, Shandong 
Province, and his wife, Y.W., his lawyers, Li Jinsong and Li Fangping, a member of his 
defence team, Dr. Teng Biao, and witnesses at his trial, Chen Gengjiang, Chen Guangdong, 
Chen Guangyu and Chen Guanghe. Chen Guangcheng has a long history of campaigning 
for the rights of farmers and the disabled. He assisted villagers in solving drinking water 
pollution problems when he was attending Najing Chinese Medicine University in 2000. 
He created and ran the &#8220;Rights Defence Project for the Disabled&#8221; under the auspices of the 
Chinese Legal Studies Association between 2000 and 2001.  Since 1996, he has provided 
free legal advice to farmers and the disabled in rural areas. In 2004, he ran a &#8220;Citizen 
Awareness and Law for the Disabled Project&#8221;. In April 2005, Chen Guangcheng and Y.W. 
began to investigate villagers&#8217; claims that Linyi city authorities were using excessive 
violence in implementing government birth quotas. The first report was published by them 
on 10 June 2005 through the Citizens Rights Defence Network (<i>gongmin weiquan wang</i>) 
and they brought lawsuits against officials involved.   Chen Guangcheng has been the 
subject of four previous communications to the Government, on 1 December 2006, 7 April 
2006, 31 October 2005 and 19 September 2005 (see above). According to new information 
received, on 27 November 2006, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial before the Yinan County 
People&#8217;s Court lasted approximately 10 hours.  It is reported that on 1 December 2006, he 
was sentenced to four years and three months&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;gathering crowds to 
disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. According to reports, Y.W. was 
under de facto house arrest from 12 August 2005 until 25 November 2006.  Since then, she </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 58 
</p>
<p>has been continuously followed by local security personnel and persons in civilian clothes 
believed to have been hired by the police.  On 28 November 2006, at around midday, she 
was arrested by members of the Yinan County Public Security Bureau and detained for 
questioning.  Their 1-year-old child was also taken but was sent home later that day.  
Approximately eight hours later, Y.W. was dragged out of a police car and left in a barely 
conscious state on the side of the road near her village.  She was taken to the Mengyin 
County Menglianggu Hospital where she was treated for extreme trauma; she was 
accompanied by up to 20 policemen as an order of &#8220;residential surveillance&#8221; had been 
issued while she was in detention. She is also suspected of committing the offences of  
&#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. It is 
reported that the local authorities have intimidated witnesses and allegedly withheld 
evidence in order to prejudice Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s retrial, and it is further reported that 
four other key witnesses in the trial have been subjected to police harassment and torture in 
order to give false testimony against Chen Guangcheng.  According to reports, Chen 
Gengjiang was detained on 26 November 2006 and held until after the hearing had taken 
place.  He was allegedly forced to sign papers in which he agreed not to participate in the 
case.  On the same day, Chen Guangdong and Chen Guangyu reportedly disappeared after 
they agreed to testify on behalf of the defence.  Later the same evening<b>, </b>Chen Guanghe was 
allegedly abducted by undercover police officers as he was on his way to meet with Li 
Fanping regarding the trial at which he was scheduled to testify the following day.  He was 
reportedly formally arrested on 28 November but his family was not informed of his arrest 
or his whereabouts until 3 December 2006.  It is alleged that Chen Guanghe was detained 
and tortured before the first trial by members of the Yinan police in order to procure a false 
confession and to testify against Chen Guangcheng.  He was convicted on the basis of the 
false confession but granted a suspended sentence.  It is feared that his recent detention 
may be related to the fact that that he has submitted written testimony stating that his prior 
evidence had been coerced through torture. Members of Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s defence team 
have also allegedly been harassed, including lawyers Li Jinsong, Li Fangping and Dr. Teng 
Biao.  The lawyers were apparently prevented from interviewing witnesses and obtaining 
further evidence for the retrial.  On 27 November 2006, as the trial was taking place, Dr. 
Teng was reportedly detained for five hours during which he was allegedly pushed to the 
ground by six or seven policemen who held him down while they searched him.  They also 
apparently searched his bags and computer and confiscated his mobile phone. 
  
89. Previously it had been reported that on 12 August 2005, Chen Guangcheng and his wife  
were put under de facto house arrest. On 25 August 2005, Chen Guangcheng evaded the 
police surrounding his village and went to Shanghai and Nanjing, then Beijing to seek help 
from lawyers.  On 6 September 2005 he was detained at the house of a friend in Bejijing by 
six men who said they were Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers. He was held overnight 
in a hotel and the head of the Linyi PSB and the Deputy Mayor of Linyi came to see him in 
the morning.  The Linyi PSB head told Chen Guangcheng he was suspected of violating 
crticle 111 of the Criminal Code (illegally providing intelligence to foreign countries), for 
which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.  However, no one produced an arrest 
warrant justifying his detention and the Linyi PSB men took Chen Guangcheng back home. 
He was placed under house arrest without any order to that effect. On 9 September 2005 his </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 59 
</p>
<p>telephone land line and mobile phone were cut off and his computer was seized. On 23 
September 2005, PSB officials searched his house without producing a search warrant.   
</p>
<p> 
90. On 4 October 2005, Beijing law lecturer Xu Zhiyong and lawyers Li Fangping and Li 
Subin attempted to visit Chen Guangcheng but they were stopped on their way to his house. 
Chen Guangcheng reportedly managed to leave his house and spoke with them briefly, but 
was then forcibly returned and beaten by men surrounding the house. The lawyers tried to 
approach Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s house but were physically prevented from doing so. Xu 
Zhiyong and Li Fangping were also beaten. The three lawyers were then taken to 
Shuanghou township police station where they were interrogated until the following 
morning. They were advised that Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s case involved &#8220;State secrets&#8221; and 
were escorted back to Beijing. On 24 October 2005, two other friends of Chen Guangcheng 
from Beijing went to visit him. As Chen Guangcheng went to greet them, he was stopped 
and beaten by around 20 men surrounding his house. They beat him with fists and sticks, 
knocked him down several times and kicked him. Chen Guangcheng was not permitted to 
seek medical attention. There were a number of eyewitnesses, who were escorted away. 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s wife, Y.W., was also prevented from leaving the house. It is also 
reported that she was beaten when she left the house to greet visitors on 27 December 2005. 
On 30 October 2005, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyer filed a lawsuit on his behalf at the 
People&#8217;s Court of Yinan County against two Shuanghou township officials. The two are 
alleged to have headed the group of more than 20 men who were watching Chen 
Guangcheng and Y.W.&#8217;s house. It is reported that to date the court has ignored Chen 
Guangcheng&#8217;s suit. With respect to the &#8220;blocking traffic&#8221; incident for which Chen 
Guangcheng was eventually charged, it is reported that on 11 March 2006, Chen 
Guangcheng marched with other villagers to protest the beating of a villager. Several 
dozen police blocked their way and surrounded them on national highway 205, thereby 
disrupting traffic. Chen Guangcheng was taken by Yinan County police from his house to 
the Yinyan Detention Centre without an arrest warrant.  There he was held incommunicado 
for 89 days until 10 June 2006. Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers collected written testimonies 
from village witnesses, who were also detained and then released on bail. These villagers 
were reportedly forced to confess or provide incriminating false information against Chen 
Guangcheng. They have stated that police used various torture methods at the detention 
centre in order to extract confessions, such as tying them to chairs with chains, depriving 
them of sleep for up to 15 days and withholding food and water. On 10 June 2006, Chen 
Guangcheng was formally detained on suspicion of &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; 
and &#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221;. On 21 June 2006, the Yinan PSB issued arrest 
warrant No. 193 (2006) for Chen Guangcheng. On the same day, Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s 
lawyers were allowed to visit him for the first time in three months. However, when they 
asked where he had been detained during that time, the prison guards interrupted their 
discussion, preventing Chen Guangcheng from answering the question.  His family has not 
been allowed to visit. His wife has remained under house arrest. On 22 June 2006, one of 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, Li Jinsong, was taken into police custody for questioning.  
On 24 June 2006, Li Jinsong and another laywer, Li Subin, tried to visit Y.W. but were 
stopped outside the house and beaten by men enforcing the house arrest of Y.W. On 27 
June 2006, they again attempted to see Y.W. but were harassed by persons in the village, 
while the police refused to intervene.  Around 20 men turned over their car (while Li </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 60 
</p>
<p>Jonsong was still inside) and smashed their cameras. Li Jonsong was then taken to the 
police station for questioning. He resigned as chief counsel for Mr. Chen&#8217;s case. On 18 
August 2006, the day before Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s trial, his lawyers were detained by police. 
Xu Zhiyong, who replaced Li Jinsong, was allegedly beaten and taken into police custody 
and not released until 22 hours later, after Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s trial had ended. Similarly, it 
is alleged that Li Jinsong and another lawyer, Zhang Lilhui, were detained by police the 
night before the trial, then released after the trial without charge.  On 24 August 2006, the 
Yinan County People&#8217;s Court convicted Chen Guangcheng under article 291 of the 
Criminal Code for &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and &#8220;intentional destruction of 
property&#8221;. Article 291 provides that &#8220;[w]here people are gathered to disturb order at 
railway stations or bus terminals, ferry landings, civil airports, marketplaces, parks, 
theatres and cinemas, exhibition halls, sports grounds or other public places, or to block 
traffic or disrupt the movement of traffic, or to resist or obstruct public security officials 
from carrying out their duties according to law, if the resulting situation is serious, the 
ringleaders shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, 
criminal detention or surveillance.&#8221; Chen Guangcheng was sentenced to four years and 
three months&#8217; imprisonment. However, the Linyi City Intermediate People&#8217;s Court, when 
reviewing the appeal by Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s lawyers, overturned this verdict on 30 
October 2006 on the basis of insufficient evidence. Instead of declaring Chen Guangcheng 
innocent and releasing him, the Intermediate Court referred the case back to the lower court 
for re-trial. Chen Guangcheng has continued to be held in detention at the Yinan County 
Detention Centre. Grave concerns are expressed that the charges against Chen 
Guangcheng and his wife Y.W.  are fabricated and are solely related to their legitimate 
activities in defence of human rights, in particular their defending villagers&#8217; rights.  Serious 
concern is expressed that Chen Guangcheng did not receive a fair trial as his lawyers were 
obstructed in all aspects of their work, from collecting evidence from witnesses to meeting 
with their client. Concern is also expressed that his lawyers were subjected to physical 
abuse and detention to prevent them from representing their client at trial. Similar concerns 
are now expressed for the fate of Y.W. Further concern is expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of any witnesses for the defence as it is feared that they have been 
subjected to acts of torture or brutality by the Yinin County PSB.   
 
91. On 5 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
regarding Li Jinsong and Li Fangping, the lawyers of Chen Guangcheng. Li Jinsong and Li 
Fangping had been the subject of three previous communications to the Government, dated 
21 December 2006, 7 April 2006 and 1 December 2006. According to new information 
received, on the night of 26 to 27 December 2006, Li Fangping and Li Jinsong were 
travelling on a bus from Beijing to Linyi. On the highway in Linyi, at around 4.30 a.m. on 
27 December 2006, the bus was stopped by unmarked cars. Unidentified men pulled Li 
Jinsong off the bus and attacked him. When Li Fangping got off the bus to try to stop the 
attack, the men attacked him as well. Li Fangping was hit on the head and received 
emergency care. Initial diagnosis shows that he suffers from a 3-cm-long wound on his 
head, but the x-ray does not show any fracture of the skull. Li Jinsong has swollen bruises 
on his left eye and left arm. The attack occurred when the lawyers were on their way to a 
meeting with Chen Guangcheng at the Yinan County Detention Centre, where Chen </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 61 
</p>
<p>Guangcheng was being detained. On 8 December 2006, Li Jinsong filed Chen 
Guangcheng's appeal against the decision rendered by the Yinan County People's Court 
with the Linyi Municipal Court. Li Jinsong also visited Chen Guangcheng at the Yinan 
Detention Centre that day. In addition, on 6 December 2006, Li Jinsong and Li Fangping 
filed administrative and civil lawsuits against the Linyi Municipal PSB, including its chief, 
Liu Jie, and other government bodies. These lawsuits were also submitted to the Linyi 
Court on 8 December 2006. Li Fangping and Li Jinsong were informed by a judge at the 
Linyi Municipal Court handling Cheng Guangcheng's appeal of Mr.Chen's request for a 
meeting with his lawyers on 27 December 2006 at the Yinan County Detention Centere. It 
is unclear whether Mr. Chen had actually requested such a meeting. Concern is expressed 
that the attack against Li Jinsong and Li Fangping may be directly related to their 
legitimate work acting on behalf of Chen Guangcheng's appeal. Further concern is 
expressed that this attack may intimidate or deter current or future lawyers from 
representing clients in cases dealing with human rights issues. 
<b> 
</b>92. On 12 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions regarding the 
secret trial and execution of Chen Tao, a Sichuan farmer found guilty of killing a 
policeman during a demonstration. Chen Tao and three other protesters were arrested in 
2004 after mass protests against a hydropower plant project in Sichuan Province. The 
protesters had clashed with police, and a riot-control policeman was killed. The four men 
were tried behind closed doors in June 2006, Mr. Chen on the charge of &#8220;deliberately 
killing&#8221; the policeman. Their lawyers were not informed of the trial (in fact, they learned of 
the trial and the sentences pronounced on 4 December 2006, when the lawyer of a 
co-defendant received the sentence sheet), nor were the families notified. Mr. Chen was 
sentenced to death, the other three defendants to prison terms. On 20 November 2006, Mr. 
Chen&#8217;s father, Chen Yongzhong, received a court notice asking him to claim the ashes of 
his son and to pay 50 yuan for the bullet used to execute him.  Chen Yongzhong declined, 
arguing that he could not be sure whether the ashes were actually his son&#8217;s. In his report on 
transparency in the use of the death penalty submitted by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to the Human Rights Council 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 30), he recalled the case of  Dong Wei, a farmer from 
Shaanxi Province, to illustrate the risks that post-conviction opacity poses to respect for 
human rights. In that case, the Shaanxi Province High People&#8217;s Court rejected Mr. Dong&#8217;s 
appeal against a death sentence in a closed session and issued an order for him to be 
executed seven days later, without informing his lawyer. The lawyer only found out two 
days before the execution was scheduled because he happened to visit the High Court to 
ask about the progress of the appeal. The lawyer then travelled to Beijing at his own 
expense to appeal the case at the Supreme People&#8217;s Court, where he convinced a judge to 
review the case. The judge agreed with the lawyer that Mr. Dong&#8217;s case needed further 
review, and the execution was stopped, reportedly just four minutes before it was 
scheduled to take place. Unfortunately, such last-minute review of the death sentence 
appears to have been successfully foreclosed in the case of Chen Tao.

<p>93. On 18 April 2006, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 25 November 2005 regarding Gao Zhisheng, a prominent human 
rights lawyer and director of a Shengzhi law firm in Beijing. In October 2005, the Beijing 
city judicial office, in its work to develop activities for the year for the normalization of law 
firms, investigated and prosecuted several law firms which were found, in the course of the 
office&#8217;s inquiries, to be operating illegally and without registration.  The Shengzhi law firm, 
after moving to new office premises, failed to register its new address, in breach of article 
21 of the Chinese Lawyers Act, which constitutes unlawful conduct punishable under 
article 9, paragraph 2, of the procedure adopted by the Ministry of Justice for disciplinary 
action against unlawful conduct by lawyers and law firms (hereinunder referred to as &#8220;the 
procedure&#8221;).  This law firm continued to act in non-compliance with the standardized 
procedures for the filing and use of legal documentation and, pursuant to articles 21 and 47 
of the Lawyers Act and article 9 of the procedure, on 30 November 2005 the Beijing city 
judicial office, acting in accordance with the law, decided to impose a penalty of one year&#8217;s 
suspension of all activities against this firm. In accordance with the investigation 
conducted by the Chinese security authorities, there is no evidence of Mr. Gao having been 
attacked by intelligence officers while driving his vehicle.  They asserted that the report 
was sheer provocation by Mr. Gao. Article 3, paragraph 4, of the Lawyers Act stipulates:  
&#8220;Lawyers practising their profession in compliance with the law shall receive legal 
protection.&#8221;  The Chinese Government said that it sets great store by the exercise by 
lawyers of their function of ensuring equal justice for society and upholding basic human 
rights and, in accordance with the law, guarantees the practice of their profession by 
lawyers.  Since the period of the reform and opening up of China, the legal profession has 
developed rapidly. At the same time as exercising their profession in accordance with the 
law, lawyers must accept regulation and oversight by the Government.  Article 3, 
paragraph 3, of the Lawyers Act provides:  &#8220;In practising their profession, lawyers are 
obliged to undergo scrutiny by the State, society and their clients.&#8221; Article 4 provides:  
&#8220;The judicial administration department of the State Council shall, in accordance with the 
present Act, exercise oversight over and provide guidance to lawyers, law firms and law 
consultations.&#8221; Article 21 stipulates:  &#8220;Law firms that change their name, move to new 
offices, amend their statutes or make changes to their partnership structure &#8230; are obliged 
to report such changes to the office of original registration.&#8221; Article 47 stipulates:  &#8220;Law 
firms acting in breach of the stipulations of the present Act shall be instructed by people&#8217;s 
judicial administration departments at the provincial, autonomous region and centrally 
administered municipality level to take corrective measures, their illegal gains shall be 
confiscated and they may also be fined an amount of between one and five times the 
amount of the gain from their unlawful activity; if the circumstances of their offence are 
serious, they shall be ordered to suspend their practice for the purposes of internal 
rectification or their business licence may be revoked.&#8221;  The procedure adopted by the 
Ministry of Justice for disciplinary action against unlawful conduct by lawyers and law 
firms stipulates, in article 9, paragraph 2:  &#8220;Law firms engaging in the practices listed 
below shall be disciplined by the people&#8217;s judicial administration departments at the 
provincial, autonomous region and centrally administered municipality level with a 
warning, by confiscation of their illegal gains, and by an instruction to suspend their 
practice for the purposes of internal rectification for a period of between three months and 
one year:  &#8230; 2.  Changes to the company name, to the company statutes, to the designation </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 63 
</p>
<p>of persons in charge of the company, to the partners, to the company&#8217;s offices, to the 
partnership agreement, etc., which have not been registered within the stipulated time .&#8230;&#8221; 
The Government noted that the present case is a typical instance where the Chinese judicial 
administration authorities, during the conduct of a routine investigation into the activities 
of a law firm, have found a law firm operating in breach of the prescribed procedure and 
have taken disciplinary action.  The Chinese judicial administration authorities have 
handled the case strictly in accordance with both the facts and the law and the case has no 
connection with this law firm&#8217;s legal representation services.  All law firms must strictly 
respect the law and no law firm may claim, on the grounds of the special nature of a given 
case, to exercise special rights which exceed the provisions of the Constitution and the law. 
</p>
<p> 
94. On 17 May 2006, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 6 March 2006 together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding<b> </b>Gao Zhisheng and 
Yang Maodong, also known as Guo Feixiong. The Government stated that in October 2005, 
the Beijing city judicial office, as part of the year-long programme of activities to 
standardize the work of law firms, investigated and prosecuted several law firms which 
were found, in the course of the offices&#8217; inquiries, to be operating illegally and without 
registration. Among these the Shengzhi law firm, after moving to new office premises, 
failed to register its new address, in breach of article 21 of the Chinese Lawyers Act, which 
constitutes unlawful conduct punishable under article 9, paragraph 2, of the procedure 
adopted by the Ministry of Justice for disciplinary action against unlawful conduct by 
lawyers and law firms (hereinunder referred to as &#8220;the procedure&#8221;). This law firm was 
acting in non-compliance with the standardized procedures for the filing and use of legal 
documentation and articles 21 and 47 of the Lawyers Act and article 9 of the procedure. On 
30 November 2005, the Beijing city judicial office, acting in accordance with the law, 
decided to impose a penalty of one year&#8217;s suspension of all activities on this firm. No 
incident involving a deliberate collision occurred at the time and in the place indicated in 
the relevant report on the matter, nor has Gao Zhisheng himself ever made any report to 
this effect to the Beijing police authorities. Furthermore, the Government reported that on 
13 September 2005, Yang Maodong was taken into police custody by the Guangdong 
public security authorities on suspicion of the offence of gathering a crowd with the 
intention of disturbing the peace. On 4 October 2005, his remand in detention was 
approved by the procuratorial authorities. On 27 December, the Guangdong procurator&#8217;s 
office decided not to proceed with his prosecution and he was released. The allegations that 
he was placed under &#8220;permanent surveillance&#8221; or beaten by the public security authorities 
are unfounded. Article 3, paragraph 4, of the Lawyers Act stipulates: &#8220;Lawyers practising 
their profession in compliance with the law shall receive legal protection&#8221;. The Chinese 
Government sets great store by the exercise by lawyers of their function of ensuring equal 
justice for society and upholding basic human rights and, in accordance with the law, 
guarantees the practice of their profession by lawyers. At the same time as exercising their 
profession in accordance with the law, lawyers must accept regulation and oversight by the 
Government as provided in article 3, paragraph 3, article 4, article 21 and article 47 of the 
Lawyers Act. The procedure adopted by the Ministry of Justice for disciplinary action 
against unlawful conduct by lawyers and law firms is stipulated in article 9, paragraph 2. 
The Government stated that the present case is a typical instance where the Chinese </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 64 
</p>
<p>judicial administration authorities, during the conduct of a routine investigation into the 
activities of a law firm, have found a law firm operating in breach of the prescribed 
procedure and have taken disciplinary action. The Chinese judicial administration 
authorities have handled the case strictly in accordance with both the facts and the law, and 
the case has no connection with this law firm&#8217;s legal representation services. All law firms 
must strictly respect the law and no law firm may claim, on the grounds of the special 
nature of a given case, to exercise special rights which exceed the provisions of the 
Constitution and the law. Finally, the Government stated that no coercive measures have 
been applied against Hu Jia by the Beijing city public security authorities. 
 
95. On 14 June 2006, the Government of China replied to the urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 7 April 2006. The Government replied that on 11 March 2006, Chen 
Guangcheng and his family members Chen Guangjun, Chen Guangyu and others 
assembled a crowd of villagers and obstructed traffic, causing a major traffic jam on 
national highway 205.  On 12 March, Chen Guangjun and Chen Guangyu were taken into 
criminal detention, in accordance with the law, on suspicion of having committed an 
offence under article 291 of the Chinese Criminal Code on the gathering of crowds for the 
purpose of disrupting the movement of traffic.  Chen Guangcheng was held for questioning 
by the local public security authorities, in accordance with the law, on suspicion of 
involvement in the offence at the scene of the crime, and was released at 9 p.m. on 12 
March. Article 291 of the Chinese Criminal Code stipulates:  &#8220;Where people are gathered 
to disturb order at railway stations or bus terminals, ferry landings, civil airports, 
marketplaces, parks, theatres and cinemas, exhibition halls, sports grounds or other public 
places, or to block traffic or disrupt the movement of traffic, or to resist or obstruct public 
security officials from carrying out their duties according to law, if the resulting situation is 
serious, the ringleaders shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 
five years, criminal detention or surveillance.&#8221;  The Government stated that in dealing with 
Mr. Chen and his associates, the public security authorities acted in compliance with the 
law in remanding them in custody or holding them for questioning.  Throughout this period 
their lawful rights were fully protected. The Government asserted that there was no 
substance to the allegation that Chen Guangcheng was subjected to beatings and placed 
under house arrest. 
</p>
<p> 
96. On 3 October 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 14 July 2006 together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders regarding Chen Guangcheng  and Guo Qizhen. The 
Government stated that Guo Qizhen was sentenced in 1995, in accordance with the law, to 
one year&#8217;s fixed-term imprisonment, suspended for one year, for the offence of assault and 
battery. Since 2000, Mr. Guo has been using the Internet to foment subversion of the 
political power of the State. On 12 May 2006, he was taken into police custody, in 
accordance with the law, for breach of the provisions of articles 105, paragraph 2, and 106 
of the Criminal Code and on suspicion of having committed the offence of fomenting 
subversion of the political power of the State. On 6 June, his remand in detention was 
approved by the procuratorial authorities and his case is currently under consideration. In </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 65 
</p>
<p>this context, the Government provided the Special Rapporteur with an excerpt of the 
relevant article.  
 
97. Concerning Chen Guangcheng, the Government reported that in the evening of 5 
February 2006, he stormed into the offices of the local village committee and started 
smashing the glass in the doors and windows.  The reason for this was that he objected to 
the work of poverty alleviation officials sent to his village. Shortly afterwards Mr. Chen 
incited Chen Guanghe and other villagers to smash a motor vehicle belonging to the local 
authorities and three police cars, and to roll these cars over into the roadside ditch, then to 
assault and beat up staff of the Yinan County police station.  In the evening of 11 March, 
Chen Guangcheng&#8217;s cousin Chen Guangyu, who had been drinking, claimed to have been 
beaten up and barged into the offices of the local village committee where he started 
smashing things.  Taking this as his pretext, Chen Guangcheng gathered together Chen 
Guangyu, Chen Guangjun, Yuan Weijing and others and from 6 p.m. that same evening, on 
the Yinghou village section of State highway No. 205, they obstructed the movement of 
traffic, barring the passage of more than 290 motor vehicles, including ambulances, and 
blocking a major road artery for three hours.  On 10 June 2006, the public security 
authorities, acting in accordance with the law, took Mr. Chen into police custody and 
launched an investigation into his actions.  On 21 June, his remand in detention was 
approved by the procuratorial authorities and, on 26 June, the matter was referred to the 
procuratorial authorities for review and prosecution.  On 4 July, the Yinan County 
procurator&#8217;s office referred his case to the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court for prosecution for 
the the offences of wilfully causing damage to property and assembling a crowd for the 
purpose of disrupting traffic. On 24 August, the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court instituted 
proceedings in this case.  The court found that Chen Guangchen, as a means of giving vent 
to personal grievances, had caused and incited others to cause wilful damage to property, 
the amount of which was considerable, and that his conduct had infringed public and 
private ownership rights and constituted the offence of wilful damage to property; it found 
further that Mr. Chen, on account of his cousin having been beaten up after drinking, had 
gathered together a crowd with a view to blocking traffic, causing a three-hour stoppage of 
traffic on the Yinghou village section of State highway No. 205 in Shuanghou township, 
that the circumstances of his offence had been particularly serious; that he had been 
responsible for organizing, planning and carrying out the actions in question and had 
therefore been the principal culprit; and that his conduct had therefore constituted the 
offence of gathering a crowd for the purpose of disrupting traffic.  As the offender in this 
case is blind, leniency could be applied.  That same day, the Yinan County People&#8217;s Court 
decided as the court of first instance to sentence Mr. Chen to seven months&#8217; fixed-term 
imprisonment for the offence of wilfully causing damage to property and to four years&#8217; 
fixed-term imprisonment for the offence of gathering a crowd to disrupt trafficl and 
ordered him to serve a sentence of four years and three months&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment. 
In this context, the Government provided the Special Rapporteur with an excerpt of article 
275 of the Chinese Criminal Code. The Government concluded that during the legal 
proceedings in this case, the court fully upheld the defendant&#8217;s rights in litigation and in the 
courtroom his two defence lawyers were able to provide full defence services. 
 </p>

</p>
<p>98. On 3 October 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 10 August 2006 regarding<b> </b>Zhao Yan. The Government reported that 
Zhao Yan is an ethnic Han male born on 14 March 1962 and a technical college graduate. 
Prior to his arrest he worked in the Beijing bureau of <i>The New York</i> <i>Times</i>. On 17 
September 2004 he was placed in criminal detention and on 20 October 2004 he was 
arrested. The Beijing No. 2 People&#8217;s Procuratorate charged Zhao Yan with the crime of 
illegally divulging State secrets to a foreign entity and the crime of fraud; a crime case was 
opened in the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. At a hearing in the Beijing No. 2 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court it was found that in the autumn of 2001, after learning that 
Feng Shanchen, a 43-year-old male who had been sentenced to 1 &#189;  years&#8217; labour 
re-education by the labour rehabilitation committee in Songyuan, Jilin Province, had not 
served his term, Zhao Yan secretly obtained Mr. Feng&#8217;s permission to use his status as a 
reporter for the <i>Baixing Xinbao</i> newspaper to go to Quian Gorlos County in Jilin Province 
to conduct an investigation. During this time Mr. Zhao falsely claimed that he could use his 
connections in the Legal Affairs Bureau of the State Council to get Mr. Feng&#8217;s sentence 
overturned, and he fraudulently obtained the sum of 20,000 yuan from Mr. Feng for that 
purpose; afterwards, however, he did not give Mr. Feng any help with this matter. The 
Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court held that Zhao Yan, motivated by illegal gain, 
fabricated a story and fraudulently obtained a relatively large sum from another person and 
that his actions constituted the crime of fraud. On 25 August 2006 the Beijing No. 2 
Intermediate People&#8217;s Court reached a verdict, which was issued in an open session: for the 
crime of fraud Mr. Zhao was sentenced to three years&#8217; imprisonment, fined 2,000 yuan and 
ordered to continue to repay the illegally obtained 20,000 yuan. The court found that the 
prosecution had failed to produce sufficient evidence to substantiate the charge of illegally 
divulging State secrets to a foreign entity and therefore issued no ruling on that charge. 
During the trial the court fully respected Mr. Zhao&#8217;s procedural rights; not only did Zhao 
Yan exercise his right to a defence, but two defence lawyers expressed his views fully. 
 
99. On 3 October of 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 20 July 2006 together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding Zheng Enchong  
and Jiang Meili, his wife. The Government stated that Mr. Zheng was sentenced to three 
years&#8217; imprisonment and one year&#8217;s deprivation of political rights because he committed a 
crime. In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Lawyers Law, Mr. Zheng was 
disbarred. In June 2006, after he had served his sentence in full and had been released, Mr. 
Zheng on numerous occasions blatantly violated the regulations governing his period of 
deprivation of political rights. On 12 July, the Shanghai public security authorities, acting 
pursuant to the Public Security Management Punishment Law of the Peoples&#8217; Republic of 
China and the Regulations Governing Procedures for the Handling of Criminal Cases by 
Public Security Organs, issued a summons to Zheng Enchong and conducted a search of 
his residence. At the same time, Jiang Meili was also issued a summons on suspicion of 
hindering an official in the discharge of his duties; the couple were released on the same 
day. At the time the summons was issued the Shanghai public security authorities handled 
the case in strict compliance with the law, protecting the legitimate rights and interests of 
Mr. Zheng and Ms. Jiang. The two signed their summonses, search warrants and the list of 
confiscated articles separately. Because they were suspected of engaging in illegal </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 67 
</p>
<p>activities, they were issued summonses and their residence was searched, both of which are 
routine activities for public security organs. The allegation in the letter that the Shanghai 
police produced a search warrant only after searching Mr. Zheng&#8217;s house is not consistent 
with the facts. 
 
100. The Government replied to the urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 22 
June 2006 by a letter dated 14 July 2006 which was regretfully not translated in time to be 
included in the present document.  
</p>
<p><b> 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>101. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its cooperation and the 
substantive information it provided in answer to his requests. He deeply regrets and 
apologizes for the fact that one of the Government&#8217;s replies has not yet been translated: this 
has made it impossible for him to make appropriate follow-up.  
 
102. The Special Rapporteur, however, notes with concern the important number of 
communications that had to be addressed to the Government of China in 2006, which 
confirms the trend already noted in 2005. He reiterates his concern in relation to the lack of 
guarantees for lawyers to perform their professional duties without risking prosecution, 
including of a criminal nature. He is also particularly concerned about the new legislation 
that was adopted which instead of providing more guarantees to lawyers, puts them even 
more in danger and does not afford them the basic conditions for performing their duties in 
an independent way. He fears that human rights victims have more and more difficulties in 
finding a legal counsel to defend their rights. In this context, he urges the Government to 
adopt as soon as possible appropriate measures to guarantee that lawyers can perform their 
duties safely and independently, without being prosecuted. He also urges the Government 
to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the fourth session 
of the Human Rights Council, detailed substantive<b> </b>answers to the allegations contained in 
his letters of 22 August 2006 and 30 November 2006, which have not been replied to.

</b>104. El 28 de agosto de 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n respecto 
de varios temas que conciernen a su mandato. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n puesta en su 
conocimiento, se estar&#237;an presentando varias irregularidades en el &#225;mbito del Poder 
Judicial, las cuales atentar&#237;an contra la independencia del mismo. As&#237;, se le inform&#243; de que 
la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n, a pesar de ser una instituci&#243;n integrante de la rama 
judicial con aproximadamente 25.000 funcionarios, no cuenta con una carrera judicial que 
proporcione a sus funcionarios la estabilidad laboral necesaria para la independencia de sus 
decisiones. Adem&#225;s, seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, existe una decisi&#243;n del Consejo de 
Estado del a&#241;o 2004 en la que se otorga a la Fiscal&#237;a un plazo de dos a&#241;os para instaurar la 
carrera judicial; al igual que otra decisi&#243;n de la Corte Constitucional (Sentencia T-131 de 
2005) que obliga a la Fiscal&#237;a a implementar la carrera judicial a m&#225;s tardar en julio de 
2006.  El Relator Especial reconoci&#243; los esfuerzos realizados por la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de 
Administraci&#243;n de la carrera fiscal que ya habr&#237;a adoptado los reglamentos de la carrera, 
analizado la proyecci&#243;n presupuestaria y establecido el cronograma para su 
implementaci&#243;n. Sin embargo, inst&#243; al Gobierno para que la carrera judicial sea instaurada 
en la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n en el m&#225;s corto plazo, con el fin de evitar que la 
independencia de las decisiones de sus funcionarios se vea afectada, lo que ya habr&#237;a 
ocurrido en el pasado, de acuerdo con varias denuncias allegadas al conocimiento del 
Relator Especial. En lo referente a la justicia penal militar, se inform&#243; al Relator Especial 
de que &#233;sta estar&#237;a asumiendo sistem&#225;ticamente investigaciones referentes a violaciones a 
derechos humanos y al derecho internacional humanitario, atribuidas a miembros de la 
fuerza p&#250;blica. Asimismo, varios fiscales a cargo de investigaciones de ejecuciones </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 69 
</p>
<p>extrajudiciales se habr&#237;an abstenido de reclamar la competencia o incluso la habr&#237;an cedido 
frente a la justicia penal militar. Un ejemplo de ello lo constituye la inicial atribuci&#243;n de 
competencia en el caso conocido como &#8220;Jamund&#237;&#8221;, el cual involucra la muerte de 10 
polic&#237;as y un civil a manos de fuerzas del Ej&#233;rcito. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Juez 
ordinario a cargo del caso decidi&#243; en un principio enviarlo a la justicia penal militar, 
argumentando la participaci&#243;n de miembros de la fuerza p&#250;blica en el mismo, pero despu&#233;s 
lo remiti&#243; al Consejo Superior de la Judicatura para que &#233;ste determinara a qu&#233; jurisdicci&#243;n 
deber&#237;a ser atribuida la competencia, afortunadamente dicho tribunal decidi&#243; remitir el 
caso a la justicia ordinaria. El Relator Especial record&#243; al Gobierno que las obligaciones 
internacionales del Estado colombiano lo compelen a dar cumplimiento al principio 
internacional seg&#250;n el cual las graves violaciones de derechos humanos deben ser 
investigadas y juzgadas por la justicia ordinaria, obligaci&#243;n claramente enunciada el 
Principio N.&#186; 3 de administraci&#243;n de justicia por los tribunales militares, contenido en el 
informe sobre esta cuesti&#243;n presentado por el Sr. Emmanuel Decaux a la Subcomisi&#243;n de 
Promoci&#243;n y Protecci&#243;n de los Derechos Humanos en su 56.&#186; per&#237;odo de sesiones 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/7). Dicho Principio dispone: &#8220;En cualquier circunstancia, la 
competencia de las jurisdicciones militares deber&#237;a suprimirse en favor de las 
jurisdicciones ordinarias para juzgar a los autores de violaciones graves de los derechos 
humanos, como las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, las desapariciones forzadas y la tortura, y 
procesar y juzgar a los autores de esos delitos&#8221;. Igualmente, el Relator Especial recibi&#243; 
informaci&#243;n sobre manipulaciones de evidencias en las escenas del crimen de ejecuciones 
extrajudiciales en las cuales habr&#237;an participado miembros de las Fuerzas Armadas, con el 
fin de presentar a las v&#237;ctimas como muertos en combate. El Relator Especial inst&#243; al 
Gobierno para que se investigaran estas denuncias y en caso de comprobarse su veracidad 
se juzgara y sancionara a los responsables. De otra parte, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, 
a&#250;n funcionar&#237;an Fiscal&#237;as en instalaciones militares, tales como Batallones y Brigadas y 
varios de los fiscales ser&#237;an oficiales de reserva, hechos que siembran dudas sobre la 
independencia e imparcialidad de las decisiones de los fiscales en cuesti&#243;n. El Relator 
Especial exhort&#243; al Gobierno a que tome las medidas necesarias para que se ponga fin a 
estas pr&#225;cticas violatorias de la independencia del poder judicial. Finalmente, el Relator 
Especial reiter&#243; su profunda preocupaci&#243;n respecto de las amenazas de que han venido 
siendo objeto en los &#250;ltimos meses varias organizaciones de abogados defensores de 
derechos humanos, organizaciones sindicales e ind&#237;genas, de parte de grupos paramilitares. 
Dicha preocupaci&#243;n fue expresada con anterioridad al Gobierno en la comunicaci&#243;n 
enviada conjuntamente con el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos 
y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y la Representante Especial del Secretario 
General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, el d&#237;a 31 de mayo de 
2006. En este punto el Relator Especial se&#241;al&#243; que resulta preocupante la situaci&#243;n de 
inseguridad de varios funcionarios judiciales, generalmente encargados de investigar 
graves violaciones de derechos humanos. A este respecto, expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por el 
hecho de que no existe un programa especial de protecci&#243;n para los funcionarios judiciales 
en situaciones de riesgo, a pesar de que tan s&#243;lo durante el a&#241;o 2005 y en lo que va corrido 
del 2006, 16 funcionarios judiciales habr&#237;an sido asesinados, 63 habr&#237;an sido amenazados, 
dos habr&#237;an sido secuestrados y dos estar&#237;an exiliados. En este contexto de amenazas e 
inseguridad de funcionarios judiciales y abogados inst&#243; al Gobierno a que adopte con 
urgencia programas especiales de protecci&#243;n. </p>

105. El 19 de octubre del 2006, el Relator Especial, junto con la Representante Especial 
del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; 
un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con actos intimidantes en contra de Jos&#233; Humberto 
Torres D&#237;az, abogado de la organizaci&#243;n no gubernamental Fundaci&#243;n Comit&#233; de 
Solidaridad con los Presos Pol&#237;ticos (FCSPP).  El abogado denunci&#243; el asesinato del 
defensor de derechos humanos Alfredo Correa de Andr&#233;is que ocurri&#243; el 17 de septiembre 
de 2004. Seg&#250;n las denuncias, el asesinato fue llevado a cabo por paramilitares con el 
apoyo de la polic&#237;a y de las fuerzas de seguridad. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, 
recientemente, desconocidos armados estar&#237;an vigilando la casa del Sr. Jos&#233; Humberto 
Torres D&#237;az.  Seg&#250;n los informes, los guardias de seguridad del abogado habr&#237;an 
establecido que los veh&#237;culos de los desconocidos pertenecen al Servicio de Inteligencia de 
la Polic&#237;a Nacional (SIPOL).  El 13 de septiembre de 2006, la FCSPP habr&#237;a contactado a 
las autoridades gubernamentales en relaci&#243;n con un documento descubierto por la oficina 
de la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n que contendr&#237;a el nombre y la direcci&#243;n del Sr. Jos&#233; 
Humberto Torres D&#237;az.  Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, en marzo de 2006 el 
documento habr&#237;a sido encontrado en la casa de un l&#237;der regional de las AUC.  El autor del 
documento habr&#237;a acusado al abogado de ser miembro del ELN y adem&#225;s habr&#237;a elaborado 
una lista de personas que habr&#237;an sido victimas de asesinatos debido a alegaciones 
similares. De igual manera se nos informa que anteriormente, individuos que hab&#237;an sido 
acusados de afiliaci&#243;n a un grupo subversivo, habr&#237;an sido objeto de graves violaciones de 
derechos humanos. El Relator Especial expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por los hostigamientos y 
las amenazas en contra del Sr. Jos&#233; Humberto Torres D&#237;az porque se teme que estos 
incidentes pueden estar relacionados con sus actividades en defensa de los derechos 
humanos, y en particular sus denuncias en contra de la impunidad en relaci&#243;n con casos de 
graves violaciones de los derechos humanos contra personas civiles.

<p> 
106. El 24 de noviembre del 2006, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n 
sobre la situaci&#243;n del abogado Adalberto Carvajal Salcedo. Seg&#250;n las informaciones 
recibidas, el abogado Adalberto Carvajal Salcedo, de 72 a&#241;os de edad, es un reconocido 
abogado laboralista, profesor y defensor de los intereses de los educadores en Colombia, 
miembro fundador de la Asociaci&#243;n de Abogados Laboralistas de Trabajadores. En el 
ejercicio de su profesi&#243;n de abogado y en representaci&#243;n de 47 docentes de la Universidad 
del Magdalena habr&#237;a realizado una conciliaci&#243;n con dicha Universidad, relacionada con el 
monto de numerosas prestaciones laborales adeudadas a los docentes por parte de la 
instituci&#243;n. El acuerdo se habr&#237;a realizado con el Rector de la Universidad, el Sr. Carlos 
Eduardo Caicedo Omar. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, dicho acuerdo fue avalado con 
posterioridad por el Tribunal Administrativo del Departamento del Magdalena, en 
cumplimiento de la legislaci&#243;n relevante. Dicha conciliaci&#243;n habr&#237;a puesto fin a un proceso 
judicial que estaba siendo adelantado con el fin de reclamar el pago de las prestaciones 
laborales adeudadas por la Universidad a sus docentes. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n 
recibida, la Contralor&#237;a Departamental del Magdalena inici&#243; una investigaci&#243;n en contra 
del Sr. Caicedo Omar, por diversos contratos y actos realizados durante su gesti&#243;n. Entre 
dichos actos se encontrar&#237;a la conciliaci&#243;n que realiz&#243; con el abogado Carvajal Salcedo. Se 
informa de que paralelamente se habr&#237;a iniciado una investigaci&#243;n penal en contra del Sr. 
Caicedo Omar, cuyo resultado ser&#237;a la acusaci&#243;n por parte de la Fiscal&#237;a de ser autor del </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 71 
</p>
<p>delito de Peculado por apropiaci&#243;n. Asimismo, se informa que la Fiscal&#237;a acus&#243; al abogado 
Carvajal  de ser el &quot;determinador&quot; del delito, es decir que incit&#243; al Rector de la Universidad 
a cometer el delito de peculado por apropiaci&#243;n. La Fiscal&#237;a habr&#237;a argumentado que el 
abogado Carvajal,  al actuar como representante de los docentes y realizar la conciliaci&#243;n 
sobre las prestaciones laborales, estaba actuando como determinador del delito. El 16 de 
marzo de 2005 el Fiscal a cargo del caso decidi&#243; precluir la investigaci&#243;n contra ambos 
acusados, por atipicidad de la conducta. El Fiscal habr&#237;a considerado que el abogado 
Carvajal hab&#237;a actuado de acuerdo con las leyes vigentes sobre conciliaci&#243;n administrativa 
y en ejercicio leg&#237;timo de su profesi&#243;n. Dicha decisi&#243;n fue recurrida por el Contralor del 
Departamento del Magdalena. El 18 de agosto de 2006 la Fiscal&#237;a revoc&#243; su decisi&#243;n 
anterior y orden&#243; la detenci&#243;n preventiva de ambos sindicados.  El abogado Carvajal es 
sindicado de ser el determinador del delito de Peculado por apropiaci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n las 
informaciones recibidas, el defensor del abogado solicit&#243; que se suspendiera la medida de 
detenci&#243;n preventiva por razones de la edad y que se tomara en cuenta el reconocimiento 
p&#250;blico del acusado. La decisi&#243;n fue negativa, argumentando que &#233;ste hab&#237;a cometido una 
falta &quot;grav&#237;sima&quot; y que se tem&#237;a que evadiera la justicia. El abogado Carvajal podr&#237;a ser 
condenado a una pena que oscila entre 6 y 26 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n. El Relator Especial 
manifest&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que el abogado Adalberto Carvajal Salcedo 
podr&#237;a estar siendo investigado penalmente por el ejercicio leg&#237;timo de su profesi&#243;n de 
abogado.

107. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 8 de diciembre de 2006, el Gobierno de Colombia 
proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n con respecto al llamamiento enviado el 19 de octubre de 2006. 
Indic&#243; que la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos otorg&#243; medidas cautelares 
de protecci&#243;n a favor de los miembros del FCSPP, las cuales inclu&#237;an al Sr. Jorge 
Humberto Torres D&#237;az. Asimismo, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que requiri&#243; varias autoridades, con 
el fin de responder a las comunicaciones enviadas por dicho organismo y por el Relator 
Especial. Indic&#243; que respecto a la supuesta vigilancia del domicilio del Sr. Torres D&#237;az, por 
parte de presuntos miembros del SIPOL, hab&#237;a solicitado a las autoridades competentes 
que suministrasen la informaci&#243;n que permitiera esclarecer los hechos ocurridos, as&#237; como 
las medidas adoptadas al respecto. Igualmente, se&#241;al&#243; que el Ministerio del Interior y de 
Justicia solicit&#243; a la Polic&#237;a Nacional realizar rondas de seguridad en torno a la vivienda del 
Sr. Torres D&#237;az, as&#237; como en torno a su casa de descanso, ubicada en la jurisdicci&#243;n del 
Municipio de Baranoa. De otra parte, dicho Ministerio solicit&#243; a la Polic&#237;a Nacional que 
estudiase la posibilidad de que se asigne al Sr. Torres D&#237;az una unidad permanente para 
prestar seguridad por las noches a su vivienda. El Gobierno indic&#243; que adicionalmente, 
solicit&#243; al Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS) que asigne un arma de apoyo 
y un escolta adicional que complementen el esquema de seguridad del que dispone 
actualmente el Sr. Torres D&#237;az. Sin embargo, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que el Sr. Torres D&#237;az se 
reserv&#243; el derecho de admisi&#243;n de la asignaci&#243;n del escolta adicional, pese a que se trataba 
de una persona que fue presentada por &#233;l mismo para conformarlo. En consecuencia, el 
esquema de protecci&#243;n del Sr. Torres D&#237;az est&#225; compuesto por dos unidades de escolta con 
su respectivo armamento, un arma de apoyo y un veh&#237;culo blindado. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n

108. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 20 diciembre de 2006, el Gobierno de Colombia 
proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n con respecto al llamamiento urgente enviado conjuntamente con 
el Relator Especial sobre formas contempor&#225;neas de racismo, discriminaci&#243;n racial, 
xenofobia y formas conexas de intolerancia el 21 de noviembre de 2005. El 10 de 
noviembre en Bogot&#225; el juzgado Primero Penal del Circuito Especializado de Antioquia 
conden&#243; a 14 a&#241;os y tres meses de prisi&#243;n a &#193;lvaro Padilla Medina, por su coautor&#237;a en el 
homicidio del dirigente comunal Orlando Valencia. El material probatorio recaudado por 
un fiscal de la Unidad Nacional de Derechos Humanos y Derecho Internacional 
Humanitario llev&#243; a &#193;lvaro Padilla a aceptar en diligencia de sentencia anticipada los 
cargos por los que fue sentenciado. Los hechos materia de investigaci&#243;n ocurrieron el 15 de 
octubre de 2005 en Bel&#233;n de Bajir&#225; (Antioquia), donde &#193;lvaro Valencia, representante de 
la comunidad de Caracol&#237;, fue subido a la fuerza en una moto por dos hombres, integrantes 
de los grupos de autodefensa. El cuerpo baleado de &#193;lvaro Valencia fue encontrado nueve 
d&#237;as despu&#233;s en un paraje de la vereda Boca de S&#225;balo, jurisdicci&#243;n del municipio de 
Chigorod&#243; (Antioquia). Para la &#233;poca de su asesinato el l&#237;der comunitario estaba al frente 
del proceso de defensa de las tierras de las negritudes. Otras cinco personas se encuentran 
vinculadas al proceso por este mismo hecho.

<p>a la Ley N.&#186;88, de atentado a la independencia territorial y a la econom&#237;a de Cuba. La 
detenci&#243;n de &#211;scar Mario Gonz&#225;lez P&#233;rez fue ya objeto de dos llamamientos urgentes 
enviados por el Relator Especial el 26 de julio de 2005 y el 3 de agosto de 2005. El Relator 
Especial es consciente de las informaciones recibidas por parte del Gobierno el 9 de agosto 
de 2005 y el 23 de agosto de 2005 con respecto a ambos llamamientos anteriormente 
mencionados.  No obstante, y de de acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recientemente recibida, los 
expertos se&#241;alan que el Sr. Gonz&#225;lez P&#233;rez continuar&#237;a tras casi un a&#241;o de detenci&#243;n sin 
recibir el juicio pertinente ni noticia del mismo. Cofundador de la agencia independiente 
Grupo de Trabajo Decoro, habr&#237;a sido detenido el 22 de Julio de 2005 junto con otros 
opositores en la v&#237;spera de una manifestaci&#243;n de la disidencia. El Sr. Gonz&#225;lez P&#233;rez se 
encontrar&#237;a actualmente internado en la c&#225;rcel &#8220;1580&#8221;, en San Miguel de Padr&#243;n (La 
Habana). La detenci&#243;n le habr&#237;a causado un grave empeoramiento de salud agravado por la 
ausencia de medicamentos, a lo que se a&#241;adir&#237;a como factor de riesgo la avanzada edad del 
detenido, de 62 a&#241;os. Por otro lado, Roberto Jes&#250;s Guerra P&#233;rez, miembro del centro de 
informaci&#243;n de la asociaci&#243;n patri&#243;tica La Corriente Matutina y colaborador de los sitios 
Nueva Prensa Cubana y Payolibre, habr&#237;a sido detenido el 13 de julio de 2005 bajo 
acusaci&#243;n de desorden p&#250;blico junto con su esposa y otro militante. Supuestamente 
detenido en las celdas de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Revolucionaria (PNR), habr&#237;a efectuado 
varias huelgas de hambre que le llevaron al hospital militar a causa de un posible 
empeoramiento de su estado de salud. Sin embargo, el Sr. Guerra P&#233;rez no habr&#237;a recibido 
ni una alimentaci&#243;n correcta ni una asistencia m&#233;dica adecuada, y habr&#237;a permanecido

</b>114. On 21 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, regarding 
the dismissal of Judge Brozova as President of the Supreme Court. According to the 
information received, the President of the Republic dismissed Judge Brozova in 
accordance with Act N. 6/2002 Coll., section 106, which states that the head of a court may 
be recalled from his/her office by the person who appointed him/her, if he/she has seriously 
violated or repeatedly violates State administration duties stipulated by law or fails to 
perform his/her duties properly. Judge Brozova was appointed by the President on 20 
March 2002. One of the reasons invoked by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Justice in their request to the President for the dismissal of Judge Brozova was that she did 
not fulfil her duty to unify the decisions of the Supreme Court. It is alleged that Judge 
Brozova was dismissed because she was taking her decisions independently from the 
remainder of the Supreme Court&#8217;s judges.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur received 
reports about the existence within the judiciary of strong pressure to achieve unconditional 
uniformity of judicial decisions. It is reported that it is not possible for Supreme Court 
judges to propose a dissenting opinion vis-&#224;-vis an individual judicial decision; this is only 
possible vis-&#224;-vis the decision of a Division (Criminal Division, Civil Division and 
Commercial Division), which is a collegium of judges.  On 7 February 2006, Judge 
Brozova filed a complaint before the Constitutional Court against her dismissal. It appears 
that on 9 February 2006, the Constitutional Court, without anticipating the final result of 
the proceedings, decided to suspend the enforceability of the dismissal decision, 
highlighting the importance of the matter since it relates to the constitutional principle of 
separation of powers. On 12 September 2006 the Constitutional Court ruled that in 
dismissing Judge Brozova, the President had violated the independence of the judiciary. 
According to the information received, the President in turn accused the judiciary of 
wanting to usurp political power. For the President to dismiss the President of the Supreme 
Court form office constitutes a serious attack on the fundamental principles of the 
separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. Articles 81 and 82 of the 
Constitution of the Czech Republic reflect these principles, which are fundamental to any 
democratic system. It is of fundamental importance that those provisions, which are in line 
with international norms and principles on the independence of the judiciary, be respected. 
Article 1 (2) and 10 of the Czech Republic Constitution compel the State to observe its 
obligations under international law. International norms and principles include article 14 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Basic Principles on 
the Independence of the Judiciary.

</b>117. Le 4 octobre 2006, conjointement avec la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire 
g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme et le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d'opinion et d'expression a 
envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant la situation de M. Rapha&#235;l Majaliwa Mulindwa, 
auditeur militaire &#224; Bukavu au Sud-Kivu. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 31 juillet 2005, 
Pascal Kabungulu, d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme, a &#233;t&#233; assassin&#233; &#224; Bukavu. M. 
Majaliwa Mulindwa ayant en charge l&#8217;instruction dudit dossier, ses enqu&#234;tes ont abouti &#224; 
l&#8217;&#233;tablissement de la responsabilit&#233; de certaines autorit&#233;s politiques dans cet assassinat. 
Depuis lors, M. Majaliwa Mulindwa aurait &#233;t&#233; menac&#233; de mort et aurait &#233;t&#233; victime de 
plusieurs tentatives d&#8217;assassinat. Il a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;charg&#233; de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te et remplac&#233; par un autre 
auditeur. Il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; interpell&#233; par le Ministre de la d&#233;fense, M. Onusumba.

118. Le replacement de M. Majaliwa Mulindwa par un autre magistrat ainsi que les 
attaques qu&#8217;il subit entravent le cours de la justice et interf&#232;rent tr&#232;s s&#233;rieusement avec 
l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance de celle-ci.  Dans ce contexte, de s&#233;rieuses craintes sont exprim&#233;es pour la 
s&#233;curit&#233; de M. Majaliwa MulindwaDe s&#233;rieuses craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es que les faits 
rapport&#233;s constituent une forme de repr&#233;sailles contre M. Majaliwa Mulindwa en raison de 
son instruction du dossier du d&#233;funt d&#233;fenseur des droits de l'homme Pascal Kabungulu.

119. Le 27 octobre 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la  Rapporteuse 
sp&#233;ciale sur la violence contre les femmes, ses causes et ses cons&#233;quences, a envoy&#233; un 
appel urgent concernant l&#8217;extraction forc&#233;e de la prison de Beni de M. Andr&#233; Muladji, chef 
d&#8217;agence de la Banque commerciale du Congo, poursuivi pour viol. Selon les informations 
re&#231;ues, lors de l&#8217;arrestation, le 9 octobre 2006, de M. Andr&#233; Muladji par le Procureur de la 
R&#233;publique pour des accusations de viol sur une mineure de 14 ans, des interventions et des 
menaces auraient &#233;t&#233; formul&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;encontre du Procureur de la R&#233;publique en vue de 
l&#8217;inciter &#224; revenir sur sa d&#233;cision. Il n&#8217;aurait toutefois pas c&#233;d&#233; &#224; ces actes d&#8217;intimidation et 
aurait confirm&#233; sa d&#233;cision de maintenir M. Andr&#233; Muladji en d&#233;tention &#224; la prison de Beni. 
Au cinqui&#232;me jour de d&#233;tention par le parquet, le Procureur aurait demand&#233; que le conseil 
de chambre se r&#233;unisse, le samedi 14 octobre 2006, afin de d&#233;cider de la prolongation de la 
d&#233;tention provisoire. C&#8217;est alors que le Pr&#233;sident du tribunal de paix (si&#233;geant en l&#8217;absence 
d&#8217;un tribunal de grande instance &#224; Beni) aurait d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;&#233;mettre un avis favorable &#224; la 
demande de mise en libert&#233; provisoire pr&#233;sent&#233;e en faveur du mis en cause avec une 
caution de deux mille cinq cents (2 500) dollars des &#201;tats-Unis. Le Procureur, consid&#233;rant 
que cette d&#233;cision est abusive, aurait introduit un appel qui serait suspensif de la d&#233;cision 
du Pr&#233;sident du tribunal de paix. Le m&#234;me jour, les proches du mis en cause auraient alors 
eu recours au maire adjoint de la ville de Beni, M. Jules Mungwana, pour faire lib&#233;rer 
l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;. Le samedi 14 octobre 2006 vers 17 heures 30, le maire adjoint, le Chef de poste 
principal de l&#8217;Agence nationale de renseignements (ANR), le Lieutenant-Colonel John 
Tshibangu, commandant de la 89e brigade, et d&#8217;autres membres du Comit&#233; urbain de 
s&#233;curit&#233; de la ville de Beni seraient arriv&#233;s &#224; la prison de Beni, ils auraient extrait de force 
M. Andr&#233; Muladji et l&#8217;aurait remis en libert&#233;, en violation flagrante de la d&#233;cision de 
justice applicable. Le maire adjoint aurait justifi&#233; son acte en indiquant que le Comit&#233; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 76 
</p>
<p>urbain de s&#233;curit&#233; de la ville de Beni aurait tenu une r&#233;union extraordinaire le m&#234;me jour 
pour des raisons d&#8217;ordre public. Les amis, sympathisants de parti politique et originaires de 
la m&#234;me province (Kasai Occidental) du mis en cause auraient menac&#233; de troubler l&#8217;ordre 
public en manifestant jusqu&#8217;&#224; la prison pour en sortir l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;. Afin d&#8217;&#233;viter des troubles 
de l&#8217;ordre public, le maire adjoint aurait donc d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;aller lib&#233;rer M. Andr&#233; Muladji. Les 
Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux expriment de vives craintes face &#224; ces all&#233;gations d&#8217;interf&#233;rence du 
pouvoir ex&#233;cutif local dans le domaine de comp&#233;tence du pouvoir judiciaire, qui 
constituent une grave entrave &#224; l&#8217;administration de la justice, &#224; la lutte contre l&#8217;impunit&#233;, &#224; 
l&#8217;&#233;limination de la violence contre les femmes ainsi qu&#8217;&#224; l&#8217;&#233;tat de droit. L&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233; ayant 
&#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; et d&#233;tenu en prison pour une inculpation de viol sur une d&#233;cision de justice, seule 
une d&#233;cision de justice, et non pas une d&#233;cision administrative, aurait pu ordonner sa 
lib&#233;ration.  
</p>
<p> 
120. Le 8 d&#233;cembre 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la 
Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteur du Groupe de travail sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire, a envoy&#233; un appel 
concernant la situation de  Marie Th&#233;r&#232;se Nlandu Mpolo-Nene, avocate au barreau de 
Kinshasa, et six de ses proches collaborateurs, parmi lesquels M. Bienvenu Makumbu, 
Pasteur Jos&#233; Inonga, M. Gauthier Lusiladio et M. Alpha, les deux autres personnes 
demeurant pour l&#8217;instant non identifi&#233;es. Selon les informations re&#231;ues,  Marie Th&#233;r&#232;se 
Nlandu Mpolo-Nene aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e le 21 novembre 2006 par les agents des services 
sp&#233;ciaux de la police &#224; Kinshasa alors qu&#8217;elle s&#8217;&#233;tait rendue au si&#232;ge des services sp&#233;ciaux 
de la police, situ&#233; dans l&#8217;immeuble Kin-Mazi&#232;re, pour apporter de la nourriture &#224; six de ses 
collaborateurs, qui avaient tous &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s le 20 novembre 2006 vers 15 heures par la 
police d&#8217;intervention rapide (PIR), alors qu&#8217;ils accompagnaient Mme Nlandu Mpolo-Nene 
qui rendait  visite &#224; une connaissance. Pendant qu&#8217;ils l&#8217;attendaient dans la voiture, les six 
hommes auraient &#233;t&#233; encercl&#233;s par quatre jeeps de la PIR avant d&#8217;&#234;tre forc&#233;s de les suivre 
vers une destination inconnue. Le 21 novembre 2006, Mme Nlandu Mpolo-Nene, qui 
s&#8217;&#233;tait rendue au si&#232;ge des services sp&#233;ciaux de la police suite &#224; une audience &#224; la Cour 
supr&#234;me de justice, aurait reconnu la voiture de ses collaborateurs sur le parking de 
l&#8217;immeuble. Apr&#232;s avoir re&#231;u confirmation de leur d&#233;tention dans les locaux des services 
sp&#233;ciaux de la police, Mme Nlandu Mpolo-Nene serait revenue dans l&#8217;apr&#232;s-midi pour leur 
apporter de la nourriture et aurait alors &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e sur place vers 16 heures, en compagnie 
de son garde du corps qui aurait &#233;t&#233; brutalis&#233;. Ils auraient ensuite &#233;t&#233; plac&#233;s en d&#233;tention 
dans les m&#234;mes locaux.  &#192; la suite de son arrestation,  Mme Nlandu Mpolo-Nene aurait &#233;t&#233; 
interrog&#233;e par un officier des Services sp&#233;ciaux, puis par le Procureur militaire de 
Kinshasa/Gom&#233;. Le lendemain, le 22 novembre, elle aurait &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233;e &#224; nouveau par le 
Procureur militaire qui lui aurait remis un mandat d&#8217;arr&#234;t provisoire, l&#8217;accusant de &#171; 
mouvement insurrectionnel &#187; et de &#171; possession ill&#233;gale d&#8217;armes de guerre &#187;. Elle aurait 
ensuite &#233;t&#233; plac&#233;e en d&#233;tention provisoire &#224; la prison de Makala. Le premier chef 
d&#8217;inculpation, &#171; mouvement insurrectionnel &#187;, serait fond&#233; sur une d&#233;claration que Mme 
Nlandu Mpolo-Nene aurait faite &#224; l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur de la Cour supr&#234;me le 20 novembre invitant 
la population &#224; se rendre &#224; une audience le lendemain. Le chef d&#8217;inculpation pour &#171; 
possession ill&#233;gale d&#8217;armes de guerre &#187; serait li&#233; &#224; la d&#233;couverte de trois grenades dans la 
voiture que conduisaient les collaborateurs de Mme Nlandu Mpolo-Nene le jour de leur 
arrestation. Par ailleurs,  Mme Nlandu Mpolo-Nene ferait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une campagne de 
d&#233;nigrement. Le soir m&#234;me de son arrestation, elle aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;e sur la cha&#238;ne TV </p>

justice avec une grenade qui aurait &#233;t&#233; trouv&#233;e en sa possession.  Le 1er d&#233;cembre, l&#8217;avocat 
de Ma&#238;tre Nlandu Mpolo-Nene aurait d&#233;pos&#233; une demande de lib&#233;ration sous caution 
aupr&#232;s du Procureur militaire qui doit se prononcer sur le statut de la d&#233;tention de Mme 
Nlandu Mpolo-Nene. &#192; ce jour, il ne se serait pas encore prononc&#233; sur cette demande. &#192; 
cet &#233;gard, il a &#233;t&#233; report&#233; que le Code militaire dispose que le mandat d&#8217;arr&#234;t est valable 
pendant quinze jours et que dans le cas o&#249; le Procureur militaire n&#8217;accorde pas la lib&#233;ration 
sous caution, le magistrat militaire qui m&#232;ne l&#8217;enqu&#234;te est autoris&#233; &#224; maintenir la personne 
soup&#231;onn&#233;e en d&#233;tention pendant trente jours suppl&#233;mentaires. La d&#233;tention pourrait 
ensuite &#234;tre prolong&#233;e pour une dur&#233;e suppl&#233;mentaire allant jusqu&#8217;&#224; douze mois. 
Concernant la situation des six autres personnes d&#233;tenues, d&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, 
ces personnes n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;es des raisons de leur arrestation au moment de leur 
d&#233;tention. Ce n&#8217;est que le lendemain de leur conduite &#224; Kin Mazi&#232;re qu&#8217;un officier leur 
aurait montr&#233; une petite bo&#238;te en all&#233;guant que cette bo&#238;te contenait trois grenades et avait 
&#233;t&#233; retrouv&#233;e dans leur v&#233;hicule. Toutefois, l&#8217;officier ne leur aurait pas montr&#233; le contenu 
de la bo&#238;te. Ces personnes ne seraient pas repr&#233;sent&#233;es par un avocat. En outre, d&#8217;apr&#232;s des 
sources fiables qui ont rendu visite aux d&#233;tenus, ces six hommes auraient eu des blessures 
fraiches sur les coudes et la poitrine, ce qui confirmerait leur affirmation selon laquelle ils 
auraient fait l&#8217;objet de traitements inhumains et d&#233;gradants durant leur arrestation et 
d&#233;tention &#224; Kin Mazi&#232;re.

Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, el Relator 
Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los 
ind&#237;genas y el Relator Especial sobre los efectos nocivos para el goce de los derechos 
humanos del traslado y vertimiento il&#237;citos de productos y desechos t&#243;xicos y peligrosos, 
envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente sobre la situaci&#243;n de los abogados Pablo Fajardo Mendoza, 
&#201;mel Ch&#225;vez Parra, Alejandro Ponce Villac&#237;s, Carmen Allauca, Luis Yanza y Julio 
Marcelo Prieto M&#233;ndez, as&#237; como de su jefe de prensa Guadalupe de Heredia. Seg&#250;n la </p>

</p>
<p>informaci&#243;n recibida, las personas arriba mencionadas habr&#237;an sido objeto de varias 
amenazas y ataques, debido supuestamente, a la actividad que desarrollan como abogados 
de las comunidades ind&#237;genas en los procesos en curso contra la filial en el Ecuador de la 
compa&#241;&#237;a Chevron Texaco. El 22 de diciembre de 2005, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de 
Derechos Humanos (CIDH) emiti&#243; medidas cautelares respecto a la situaci&#243;n de cuatro de 
los cinco abogados mencionados con la excepci&#243;n de Carmen Allauca. Se alega que las 
medidas de protecci&#243;n ordenadas por dicho organismo no han sido, hasta la fecha, 
ejecutadas. Asimismo, seg&#250;n se informa, se habr&#237;a solicitado a la CIDH, el 28 de abril de 
2006,  que las medidas cautelares tambi&#233;n fueran aplicadas a Guadalupe de Heredia quien 
habr&#237;a sido objeto de varios ataques &#250;ltimamente. El 21 de abril de 2006, una de sus amigas 
habr&#237;a sido atacada por dos hombres que supuestamente la habr&#237;an golpeado en la cabeza y 
le habr&#237;an robado su cuaderno para tomar notas y el bolso cuando se dirig&#237;a a visitar a 
Guadalupe de Heredia a  su domicilio. Se alega que dicho ataque iba dirigido a Guadalupe 
de Heredia, puesto que fue realizado en la entrada de su domicilio. Igualmente, se afirma 
que el 29 de abril de 2006, un cami&#243;n sin placas intent&#243; sacar de la v&#237;a el veh&#237;culo 
conducido por Guadalupe de Heredia, quien iba acompa&#241;ada de su hija. Dicho ataque 
habr&#237;a sido denunciado ante la Oficina del Fiscal el 12 de mayo de 2006. De otra parte, el 
19 de mayo de 2006, la oficina de Julio Marcelo Prieto M&#233;ndez habr&#237;a sido objeto de una 
intrusi&#243;n ilegal. Seg&#250;n se informa, no hubo ning&#250;n robo a pesar de la existencia de varios 
equipos de oficina de un alto valor econ&#243;mico. Sin embargo, se alega que los archivos del 
Sr. Prieto M&#233;ndez habr&#237;an sido revisados. El Sr. Prieto M&#233;ndez present&#243; una queja ante la 
Oficina del Fiscal General en la ciudad de Quito, 28 de mayo de 2006, pero se desconoce si 
las autoridades han iniciado alguna investigaci&#243;n.  Durante la reciente visita al Ecuador del 
Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales de 
los ind&#237;genas, llevada a cabo del 25 de abril al 5 de mayo de 2006, el Relator Especial 
discuti&#243; con el Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica las preocupaciones respecto a los ataques y 
amenazas contra los ind&#237;genas y sus representantes legales en casos de leg&#237;tima protesta 
contra los impactos de las actividades extractivas en el pa&#237;s.

</b>125. Mediante comunicaciones de fechas 4 de julio y 18 de septiembre de 2006, el 
Gobierno del Ecuador proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n con respecto al llamamiento urgente 
enviado el 19 de junio del 2006. El Gobierno indic&#243; que la Procuradur&#237;a General del Estado 
estaba al tanto de las medidas cautelares tomadas por la CIDH el 22 de diciembre del 2005, 
pero insisti&#243; en el que de conformidad con el art&#237;culo 25(4) del Reglamento de la CIDH , el 
otorgamiento de medidas cautelares no prejuzga el fondo de la cuesti&#243;n. Inform&#243; de que 
con fecha de 21 abril de 2006, el Gobierno puso en conocimiento de la CIDH el estado de 
ejecuci&#243;n de las medidas cautelares, y en particular el hecho de que la Direcci&#243;n Nacional 
de Inteligencia de la Polic&#237;a nacional hab&#237;a tomado contacto con los peticionarios el 5 de </p>

<p>enero de 2006 a fin de dise&#241;ar un mecanismo consensuado de seguridad para garantizar su 
vida e integridad f&#237;sica, en los t&#233;rminos dispuestos por la CIDH. El Gobierno declar&#243; que 
los peticionarios han transmitido las siguientes denuncias. El se&#241;or Alejandro Ponce 
Villac&#237;s present&#243; una denuncia por supuesto robo cometido en sus oficinas el 7 de 
noviembre del 2005 ante la Unidad de Delito contra la propiedad de la Fiscal&#237;a Distrital de 
Pichincha. Al respeto, la Polic&#237;a Judicial de Pichincha, mediante Parte Informativo 
2006-605-PJP, de 23 de enero de 2006, inform&#243; de que la puerta de la oficina contaba con 
su respectiva seguridad y no presentaba ning&#250;n tipo de forzamiento. La Fiscal&#237;a inform&#243; 
que el caso se encuentra archivado. Asimismo, el se&#241;or Ponce Villac&#237;s present&#243; una 
denuncia por amenazas e intimidaci&#243;n, ante la Unidad de Delitos contra las personas, el d&#237;a 
de 6 de enero de 2006, cuya etapa de indagaci&#243;n previa fue abierta el 18 de enero. Por su 
parte, la se&#241;ora Mar&#237;a Guadalupe de Heredia present&#243; una denuncia el 12 de mayo de 2006 
por el presunto delito de intimidaci&#243;n. En ese mismo sentido procedieron los se&#241;ores 
Ermel Ch&#225;vez, Alejandro Ponce Villac&#237;s, Pablo Fajardo y Luis Yanza. El se&#241;or Ermel 
Ch&#225;vez tambi&#233;n present&#243; una denuncia por supuestos actos de intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas de 
muerte, ante la Fiscal&#237;a N.&#186;1 del Cant&#243;n Lago Agrio, en la que tampoco ha reconocido su 
firma y r&#250;brica, en contra de lo dispuesto por el Art&#237;culo 46 del C&#243;digo de Procedimiento 
Penal. El Gobierno aleg&#243; que no existe registro de que la se&#241;ora Carmen Allauca haya 
presentado denuncia alguna y afirm&#243; que ninguno de los querellantes ha solicitado examen 
m&#233;dico alguno. Los casos se encuentran en fase de indagaci&#243;n previa y, conforme a lo 
dispuesto por el Art&#237;culo 215 del C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal del Ecuador, se 
mantienen con car&#225;cter reservado para el p&#250;blico en general y han recibido el debido 
proceso conforme las normas legales vigentes en el pa&#237;s y las garant&#237;as que otorga la 
legislaci&#243;n ecuatoriana par este tipo de procedimientos. No existe a&#250;n procedimiento en 
firme en ninguna de las causas, no se han determinado culpables y por los tanto no se han 
establecido eventuales responsabilidades en los hechos imputados. No cabe en 
consecuencia y de acuerdo con las garant&#237;as constitucionales del debido proceso y de 
presunci&#243;n de inocencia adoptar sanciones de ning&#250;n tipo. Por las mismas razones, ni las 
supuestas v&#237;ctimas ni sus familiares han recibido compensaci&#243;n o indemnizaci&#243;n alguna.

<p> 
126. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 11 de enero de 2007, el Gobierno del Ecuador 
proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n con respecto a la carta enviada el 27 de noviembre de 2006 en 
relaci&#243;n con las acciones emprendidas para el seguimiento de las recomendaciones 
enumeradas en el informe de misi&#243;n en Ecuador. El Gobierno de Ecuador inform&#243; lo 
siguiente:  
</p>
<p><b><i>a</i>) Equidad de G&#233;nero en la integraci&#243;n de la Corte Suprema de Justicia:  
</b>Sobre el tema de la equidad de genero, la Corte Suprema de Justicia comparte el deseo de la 
Relator&#237;a de que un 20 % de mujeres, integren la Corte; lastimosamente las mujeres no 
presentan sino pocas candidaturas, o a&#250;n est&#225;n ausentes en las convocatorias a los 
concursos, esta situaci&#243;n escapa al control de la funci&#243;n judicial e imposibilita tal 
integraci&#243;n; igual problema existe en cuanto se refiere a la integraci&#243;n de los Tribunales 
con la participaci&#243;n de afroecuatorianos e ind&#237;genas; 
</p>
<p><b><i>b</i>) Nueva Ley Org&#225;nica de la Funci&#243;n Judicial: </b>La Corte Suprema de Justicia, 
desde hace varios a&#241;os, remiti&#243; al Congreso Nacional un proyecto de Ley Org&#225;nica de la 
Funci&#243;n Judicial, la actual Corte esta pendiente del seguimiento del destino de este 
proyecto, manteniendo contacto con el Congreso Nacional para lograr la aprobaci&#243;n de un </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 80 
</p>
<p>texto normativo en las mejores condiciones. En ese proyecto de Ley, se fortalecer&#225; la 
carrera judicial y lo que  tiene que ver con la Unidad Jurisdiccional, la Defensor&#237;a Publica y 
la cooptaci&#243;n de los magistrados de la Funci&#243;n Judicial. Adem&#225;s, la Corte Suprema de 
Justicia se encuentra empe&#241;ada en preparar e impulsar diversos proyectos legales que 
mejoren la administraci&#243;n de justicia, se trata de un conjunto de propuestas de reforma al 
C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal, y otras leyes importantes que permitan lograr un sistema 
oral, &#225;gil, eficaz y oportuno en el tramite de los procesos en todas las materias y no solo en 
lo penal; 
</p>
<p><b><i>c</i>) El establecimiento de una eficaz defensor&#237;a publica: </b>La Comisi&#243;n creada para 
la aplicaci&#243;n de la Reforma Procesal Penal, la misma que esta integrada por el Presidente 
de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, la Ministra Fiscal General, el Director de la Polic&#237;a 
Judicial, el Subsecretario Jur&#237;dico de la Presidencia de la Republica, el Ministro de 
Gobierno y la Fundaci&#243;n Esquel, impuls&#243; el proyecto de Ley de Defensa Publica y lo 
present&#243; al Congreso Nacional. Dicho proyecto de ley establec&#237;a una instituci&#243;n aut&#243;noma, 
denominada Defensor&#237;a Publica, con presupuesto propio, que cuente con defensores de 
planta, es decir abogados contratados por el Estado y abogados de organizaciones de la 
sociedad civil, con absoluta independencia de cualquier otro &#243;rgano o funci&#243;n estatal, con 
el fin de que brinden un servicio efectivo de defensa para todas las personas que no est&#225;n en 
capacidad de contratar los servicios de un abogado, con atenci&#243;n especial a los grupos 
vulnerables, para evitar que persona alguna quede estado de indefensi&#243;n. Hace pocas 
semanas el Congreso Nacional aprob&#243; dicha Ley; sin embargo por no contar con la fuente 
financiamiento en el Prepuesto General del Estado, el Presidente de la Republica objet&#243; 
totalmente esa Ley y, de acuerdo con lo dispuesto en la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica ecuatoriana, 
es necesario esperar un a&#241;o para insistir en el tema; 
</p>
<p><b><i>d</i>) Concreci&#243;n del principio de unidad jurisdiccional: </b>El Consejo Nacional de la 
Judicatura ha presentado ante el Congreso Nacional un proyecto de ley que aun no se ha 
tramitado, mediante el cual se pretende viabilizar el cumplimiento de la disposici&#243;n 26.&#170; de 
la Constituci&#243;n que se&#241;ala: &#8220;Todos los magistrados y jueces que dependan de la Funci&#243;n 
Ejecutiva pasaran a la Funci&#243;n Judicial y, mientras las leyes no dispongan algo distinto, se 
someter&#225;n a sus propias leyes org&#225;nicas&#8221;. Esta disposici&#243;n incluye a jueces militares y de 
polic&#237;a. Por su parte el Ministerio de Defensa, ha presentado el proyecto de Ley Org&#225;nica 
de las Fuerzas Armadas, ante el Congreso Nacional, en concordancia con la Unidad 
Jurisdiccional, la Comisi&#243;n de lo Civil y lo Penal del Congreso Nacional se encuentra 
analizando dicho proyecto y se espera que su informe sea favorable; 
</p>
<p><b><i>e</i>) Integraci&#243;n del Consejo Nacional de la Judicatura: </b>El consejo Nacional de la 
Judicatura se encuentra ya debidamente integrado y cumpliendo sus funciones especificas, 
de acuerdo con la Constituci&#243;n y la Ley; 
</p>
<p><b><i>f</i>) Iniciativas de cooperaci&#243;n internacional en el &#225;mbito de la Justicia 
</b>La Corte Suprema desde que qued&#243; integrada, ha impulsado y ha retomado los proyectos 
de Cooperaci&#243;n Internacional para la Administraci&#243;n de Justicia, los cuales han sido 
canalizados por intermedio de la Unidad de Coordinaci&#243;n para la Reforma de la 
Administraci&#243;n de Justicia en el Ecuador (Projusticia); 
</p>
<p><b><i>g</i>) Integraci&#243;n del Tribunal Constitucional profesionalizado e independiente: 
</b>El 22 de febrero de 2006, se llev&#243; a cabo la elecci&#243;n de los nuevos vocales del Tribunal 
Constitucional de las ternas enviadas por los colegios electorales, mediante un proceso 
transparente que gener&#243; confianza en la sociedad por la participaci&#243;n de destacados juristas </p>

</p>
<p>de la sociedad. El 24 de febrero de 2006, se posesionaron los nuevos vocales, dando paso a 
las reuniones preparativas para designar a las autoridades nominadoras de este organismo. 
El 6 de marzo de 2006 fue designado en calidad de Presidente del Tribunal Constitucional 
el Dr. Santiago Vel&#225;squez Coello; y, como Vicepresidente, el Dr. Tarquino Orellana 
Serrano. Cabe destacar que estas personalidades fueron acreditadas de las dos ternas que 
envi&#243; la Corte Suprema de Justicia, que realiz&#243; un concurso de meritos y oposici&#243;n, con el 
aval de la sociedad. Los vocales elegidos y posesionados se organizaron internamente, 
quedando conformadas las respectivas salas. Esta organizaci&#243;n responde a una distribuci&#243;n 
equitativa, conociendo todas ellas, por sorteo, las diferentes acciones y recursos 
constitucionales sometidos a su an&#225;lisis y resoluci&#243;n. El Tribunal Constitucional, tal como 
lo indica la Ley, act&#250;a con autonom&#237;a e independencia. Adem&#225;s, sus vocales han procurado 
establecer una agenda de trabajo, en la que se destacan como puntos principales: la 
independencia judicial, realizaci&#243;n de procesos integrales para todo el sector, actualizaci&#243;n 
de normativa, actividades y acciones de lucha contra la corrupci&#243;n, capacitaci&#243;n y 
rendici&#243;n de cuentas a la sociedad ecuatoriana. Por su parte, la Corte Suprema de Justicia, 
aun despu&#233;s de haber participado en la conformaci&#243;n del Tribunal Constitucional, con el 
env&#237;o de los candidatos que le corresponden, considera que para resolver los problemas de 
la real independencia y profesionalizaci&#243;n que el Tribunal Constitucional debe reunir, se 
requieren reformas legales y constitucionales que aun no se han dado. Sin embargo, se 
informa que, una vez que el nuevo Presidente de la Republica asuma la jefatura del Estado, 
el 15 de enero de 2007, se podr&#225;n evaluar los pasos que a futuro se proyecten para la 
posible convocatoria a una Asamblea Constituyente que eventualmente asumir&#225; el 
proyecto de una nueva Constituci&#243;n ecuatoriana en la que se regular&#225;n dichos aspectos; 
</p>
<p><b><i>h</i>) Conformaci&#243;n de un Tribunal Supremo Electoral imparcial: </b>El Presidente 
electo, que se posesionar&#225; en el cargo el 15 de enero de 2007, plante&#243; durante su campa&#241;a 
electoral, una reforma pol&#237;tica  profunda, para lo cual ha informado que convocar&#225; a una 
consulta popular, con el fin de establecer una Asamblea Constituyente, con plenos poderes. 
La reforma pol&#237;tica pretende lograr la independencia y corresponsabilidad de las funciones 
del Estado y la reestructuraci&#243;n de los organismos de control. Entre las principales 
reformas esta la despartidizaci&#243;n del Tribunal Supremo Electoral, del Tribunal 
Constitucional y de todos los organismos de control. Adem&#225;s, se pretende reformar la Ley 
de Elecciones para obligar a los partidos a democratizar sus estructuras y regular la 
revocatoria del mandato para todas las dignidades de elecci&#243;n popular, entre otras reformas. 
Se busca una correcta administraci&#243;n de justicia, garantizar la seguridad y los derechos de 
las personas. Sin embargo, las reformas se&#241;aladas a&#250;n no se ha concretado, inclusive el 
estatuto para la Asamblea Constituyente est&#225; todav&#237;a en la etapa de discusi&#243;n entre varios 
movimientos sociales y el bur&#243; pol&#237;tico del Presidente electo; 
</p>
<p><b><i>i</i>) Nombramiento del Ministro Fiscal General: </b>En cuanto al nombramiento del 
nuevo Ministro fiscal General del Estado, de acuerdo con la Constituci&#243;n y la Ley, el 
Consejo Nacional de la Judicatura se encuentra actualmente en el tr&#225;mite  del concurso 
correspondiente, convocado p&#250;blicamente y en forma transparente, lo que culminar&#225; con la 
conformaci&#243;n de la terna que se remitir&#225; al congreso Nacional para la designaci&#243;n del caso.

Communications sent

<p><b> 
</b>129. On 22 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression regarding four judges, Ahmed Mekki, Mahmoud Mekki, 
Mahmoud al Khudayri and Hisham Bastaweessee, who are all Vice-Presidents of the Court 
of Cassation.  According to information received, the High Council of the Judiciary lifted 
the immunity of the four judges for publicly criticizing fraudulent acts which are alleged to 
have occurred during the parliamentary elections in 2005, as well as criticizing a proposed 
bill on the administration of justice. This followed the issuance of statements by the Judges 
Clubs in Cairo and Alexandria, referring to numerous complaints they had received from 
judges and stating that the complaints should be examined by the Prosecutor-General.  The 
Judges Clubs also requested the Prosecutor-General to look into the incidents involving 
judges during the elections, and possibly to provide compensation for the judges involved. 
Ahmed Mekki, Mahmoud Mekki, Mahmoud al Khudayri and Hisham Bastaweessee are 
being interrogated by the State Security Court, which was established under the emergency 
law. It is reported that the State Security Court has not taken time to investigate claims by 
the judges and a number of civil society organizations that fraudulent acts took place 
during the elections, but it has been very quick to commence an investigation against the 
judges for making statements that fraudulent acts had occurred. The Special Rapporteurs 
and the Special Representative are concerned that the lifting of the judicial immunity of the 
judges and their interrogation by the State Security Court is a violation of their right to 
freedom of expression as well as an attempt to pressure them, which would amount to an 
interference with the independence of the judiciary.

130. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Nagi Dirbala, Ahmad Saber and Assem Abdel Gabbar, 
three Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation. According to the information received, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 83 
</p>
<p>High Council of the Judiciary lifted the immunity of Nagi Dirbala and Ahmad Saber to 
enable their interrogation in connection with statements they had made criticizing 
fraudulent acts that had allegedly occurred during the parliamentary elections in 2005, and 
their comments related to the reform of the administration of justice. Concern is expressed 
that these events may fall into the reported pattern of harassment against members of the 
judiciary who express critical views of the Government. Ahmed Mekki, Mahmoud Mekki, 
Mahmoud al Khudayri and Hisham Bastaweessee have already been the subject of an 
appeal by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent on 22 February 2006 (see above). The Special Rapporteurs 
reiterate the concern expressed in that urgent appeal that the lifting of the judicial immunity 
of this large number of judges of the Court of Cassation and their interrogation by the State 
Security Court represents a violation of their right to freedom of expression and may 
represent an attempt to pressure them that would amount to an interference with the 
independence of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>131. On 5 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with  
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding the members of Egypt&#8217;s Judges Club and demonstrators 
who gathered to support the assembly of the Judges Club, as well as Ahmed Mekki, 
Mahmoud Maki, Hisham Bastawissi, Mahmoud al Khudayri, Nagi Derbala, Ahmad Saber 
and Assem Abdel Gabbar, all Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation. According to the 
information received, the Minister of Justice decided to transfer Judges Maki and 
Bastawissi to the Disciplinary Council. It is alleged that this decision is an infringement of 
the independence of the judiciary and a breach of the provisions of the Judiciary Authority 
Law relating to the investigation of judges, and is intended to punish the two judges for 
their allegations of widespread electoral fraud during the parliamentary elections of 2005 
and for their activism in favour of judicial reform, including their calls for amendment of 
the Judicial Authority Law to guarantee the impartiality and the financial and 
administrative independence of the judiciary. In particular, it is alleged that currently the 
Judicial Authority Law provides the Minister of Justice with the powers to determine the 
composition of the Supreme Judicial Council, to appoint the Head of the Court of 
Cassation and to decide on the budget. Such control of the Supreme Judicial Council 
allows the Minister to influence that body&#8217;s decisions on the appointment, promotion, 
transfer and discipline of all judges. Also, the Disciplinary Council is headed by the Head 
of the Court of Cassation (appointed by the Minister of Justice) and possesses the power to 
dismiss judges.  On 19 April 2006, to protest against this decision, the Judges Club 
launched a sit-in at its headquarters in Cairo. On 24 April, hundreds of police arrived in 
front of the Judges Club where a group of peaceful protesters had gathered in support of the 
judges' sit-in. Police tore down banners listing the Judges Club's demands and verbally and 
physically attacked some of the protesters. When Judge Hamza took out his mobile phone 
in an attempt to photograph the events,  several police officers and two State Security 
Intelligence (SSI) officers verbally insulted and physically assaulted him and forced him 
into a police vehicle along with 14 other protesters. It is reported that SSI officers, officers </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 84 
</p>
<p>from Kasr al Nil station and officers from Shurtat Al-Marafik participated in the attack on 
the protesters. All three forces operate under the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, it is 
alleged that these events took place in the presence of high-ranking Ministry officers. 
Judge Hamza, his brother and a university professor were released later that day upon the 
intervention of the President of the Judges Club. Upon his release, Judge Hamza was taken 
to the hospital for treatment. According to a medical report from the Shahir Hospital of 
Masr Al-Gedina, he suffered several injuries including twisted ligaments in his wrist, a 
bloody nose and a number of scratches and bruises on his face, chin and feet. He remains 
hospitalized. This attack is particularly grave considering that Judge Hamza had undergone 
open-heart surgery. The 12 other people arrested on 24 April 2006 are in custody following 
an order by the Prosecutor- General to detain them for 15 days pending the results of the 
interrogations in accordance with article 206 of the Criminal Procedures Law. They are 
charged with making false claims, resisting authorities and assembling and blocking public 
roads. The next day, the Prosecutor-General issued a statement accusing the protesters of 
attacking the police sent to remove banners. Concern is expressed that the 
Prosecutor-General issued this statement before the completion of the investigations, in 
violation of his obligation of impartiality and confidentiality. According to the information 
received, two similar incidents occurred on 26 and 27 of April 2006, when hundreds of 
police again intervened during the peaceful sit-in at the Judges Club and the peaceful 
protests in support of the Judges Club demands held outside its premises. On 26 April, 
charges were brought against 16 protesters and on 27 April, against 12. The accusations 
included assembly, insulting the President of the Republic, purposefully delaying public 
transportation, slander of public officials, destroying public property and possession of 
publications. It is also reported that the State Security General Prosecution issued arrest 
warrants for 13 additional protesters, charging them with organizing demonstrations and 
possessing publications aimed at disrupting public order. Reports indicate that thus far two 
of them have been arrested. Concern is expressed that these events fall into the reported 
pattern of harassment of members of the judiciary and their supporters who express critical 
views against the Government. Concern is heightened by the fact that the transfer of 
Mahmoud Maki and Hisham Bastawissi to the Disciplinary Council follows the lifting of 
the immunity, in order to initiate an investigation, of five other deputies to the Head of the 
Court of Cassation, Ahmed Mekki, Mahmoud al Khudayri, Nagi Derbala, Ahmad Saber 
and Assem Abdel Gabbar, for expressing their opinions regarding the parliamentary 
elections in 2005 and the reform of the administration of justice. Those judges have already 
been the subject of two appeals by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent on 22 February and 24 March 2006 (see 
above). The Special Rapporteurs express their serious concerns that these incidents, as well 
as the lifting of the judicial immunity of this large number of judges of the Court of 
Cassation and the investigation into their activities constitute an attempt to prevent the 
judges and the demonstrators supporting their cause from exercising their right to freedom 
of expression and freedom of association, in particular with regard to their claims relating 
to a democratic system and the financial and administrative independence of the judiciary. 
They also express their concern at the fact that the Government refuses to involve the 
Judges Club in the drafting of the proposed amendments to the Judicial Authority Law, a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 85 
</p>
<p>law that directly affects their profession and in relation to which the judges&#8217; comments 
should be taken into serious consideration.  
 
132. On 12 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation to the Government of 
Egypt about the Judicial Authority Law which was approved by the Egyptian Parliament 
on 26 June 2006. He indicated that the law in question fails to address a number of 
concerns referred to in his previous communications to the Government dated 22 February, 
23 April and 5 May 2006 as well as a press release of 14 June 2006. The Special 
Rapporteur expressed his serious apprehension about the negative impact that this law may 
have on the independence of the judiciary in Egypt. He drew the attention of the 
Government to some of his specific concerns regarding this reform: 
 
 - The law does not set out clear criteria for the selection and appointment of judges. The 
law should clearly spell out such criteria, which should include appropriate legal training 
and qualifications in law, integrity and ability. The law should clearly state that women 
have the right to occupy these positions in full equality with men, and prohibit any 
discrimination against a person on the grounds of gender, race, colour, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or status; 
</p>
<p>  
 - The law fails to recognize the right of judges to form and join associations of judges 
or other organizations to represent their interests, to promote their professional training and 
to protect their judicial independence; 
</p>
<p> 
 - The law does not set out objective criteria for the assignment of cases to judges but 
allows heads of court to assign specific judges to cases; 
</p>
<p> 
 - The law prevents judges from being represented by a lawyer to defend them before a 
disciplinary court, in breach of the constitutional and internationally recognized right of all 
citizens to be represented by a lawyer at all stages of legal proceeding brought against them. 
Also, the law does not provide judges with an effective right to challenge a disciplinary 
decision before a higher court, since it limits such second-degree review to an error in law 
and does not allow for a review on the substance of the litigated issue. Therefore, the 
disciplinary procedure against judges is seriously flawed and does not comply with 
minimum fair trial guarantees; 
</p>
<p> 
 - The law retains the system whereby judges are seconded to perform non-judicial work 
within the executive branch, and extends the period of secondment from three to six years. 
Such secondment, and its particularly long duration, is not compatible with the 
fundamental principles of the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary: 
it endangers the independence of judges by requiring them to serve the executive for 
particularly long periods of time. Moreover, for certain high-ranking posts close to the 
Minister, no maximum secondment period is set. It is also of utmost concern that no 
objective criteria are set for decisions on secondment; such decisions can therefore be used 
to put pressure on judges, to threaten or reward them, and therefore seriously infringes their 
independence; 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 86 
</p>
<p> - Finally, the law does not clearly address the separation between the prosecution and 
the executive branch, and does not set clear criteria for the selection of the Chief 
Prosecutor. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
 
</b>133. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that instead of reducing the tension, which has 
already led to a number of demonstrations by judges and civil society in recent months, the 
law will only further aggravate the crisis. One reason may be that the above concerns and 
the views of the Judges Clubs were not taken into consideration in preparing the draft. The 
Special Rapporteur therefore urges the Government to consider refraining from 
promulgating the proposed law and to relaunch the legislative process by sending the law 
back to the Parliament for reconsideration, allowing for deliberation through further 
dialogue and consultation with all sectors concerned, in particular the Judges Clubs and 
experts in constitutional law. Such a process would allow Egypt to be equipped with a 
judicial law that is consistent with international norms and principles on judicial 
independence and to preserve the reputation, credibility and independence of Egypt&#8217;s 
judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> 
Communications received 
</b></p>
<p> 
134. On 11 May 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 5 May 2006, 
indicating that Judge Mahmud Sadiq Birham, Head of the Cairo Court of Appeal, filed a 
complaint with the Department of Public Prosecutions stating that during the National 
Assembly elections he had chaired the general committee for the Nabruh District in the 
Governorate of Daqhaliyah during both rounds of the election and that the committee had 
performed its duties to the best of its ability, as confirmed even by the candidates who 
failed to win a seat.  However, he had been astonished by an item published in the <i>Sawt 
al-Ummah </i>newspaper on 12 December 2005, attributed to journalist Huda Abu Bakr and 
entitled &#8220;Blacklist of judges accused of rigging the elections&#8221;.  The article gave his initials 
(M.S.B.) and the name of the election committee which he had chaired.  He had 
furthermore been surprised by a front-page story published in the <i>Afaq Arabiyah</i> 
newspaper on 22 December 2005 listing the full names, including his own, of judges who 
were said to have rigged the elections.  He asked for a criminal action to be brought against 
all those who had defamed him. Investigations revealed that the press statements accusing 
Judge Birham and other judges of rigging the elections had come from Judge Mahmoud 
Maki and Judge Hisham Bastawissi.  It also emerged that the two men had not provided 
any proof of the allegations against the judge; this constitutes unlawful damage to the 
victim&#8217;s reputation.  All these elements constitute the offence of defamation, which is a 
crime under the Criminal Code.  The two men were therefore sent before a disciplinary 
tribunal in accordance with article 99 of the Judicial Authority Act. The disciplinary 
hearing was conducted in accordance with the terms and guarantees contained in the Act.  
On 18 May 2006, the judicial disciplinary tribunal, chaired by the Chief Justice of the 
Court of Cassation, acquitted Judge Maki because the premise of his remarks, namely that 
an investigation was needed to verify the charges, had been deleted from the press report.  
Moreover, he had not said anything to indicate that he believed the report to be true.  On the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 87 
</p>
<p>other hand, Judge Bastawissi was found guilty and was censured by the disciplinary board.  
Censure is a disciplinary penalty that does not prevent a judge from carrying out his work.  
It was imposed on the judge because he had accused the complainant of rigging the 
elections without providing any evidence to support the charge.  
</p>
<p> 
135. The investigation of the two judges was based on a complaint brought by the victim 
for defamation.  This is an offence under the Egyptian Criminal Code.  The Department of 
Public Prosecutions, which is part of the judiciary, launched the investigation on the basis 
of the victim&#8217;s complaint and referred both judges to the competent disciplinary tribunal 
for a judicial hearing in accordance with the Judicial Authority Act.  This is consistent with 
the international human rights treaties to which Egypt is a party. The investigation was not 
launched because of a complaint about the views of the two judges on the parliamentary 
elections or judicial reform.  Moreover, the draft law on amending the Judicial Authority 
Act was publicized as soon as it was given Cabinet approval.  A delegation from the Judges 
Club met with the speaker of the Advisory Council and the speaker of the National 
Assembly to present the Club&#8217;s views on the draft. There is no truth to the complaint by the 
two Special Rapporteurs that judges Nagi Derbala, Ahmed Saber, Ahmed Mekki and 
Mahmoud al-Khudayri were investigated for expressing their views about the 
parliamentary elections and judicial reform.  The disciplinary case was only brought 
against Judge Hisham Bastawissi and Judge Mahmoud Maki. All domestic laws and 
international treaties stipulate that the right to freedom of expression must be exercised in a 
manner that is lawful and does not damage the reputation of others without substantiating 
evidence (paragraph 2 of article 302 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, based on the 
European Convention on Human Rights). 
</p>
<p> 
136. On 24 July 2006, the Government replied to Special Rapporteur&#8217;s allegation letter 
of 12 July 2006 indicating that it is not within the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers to comment on laws approved by the Egyptian 
Parliament, or to attempt to intervene with the executive branch of Government with a 
view to a veto of these laws. Further, the Government declared that the legislative authority 
of Egypt enjoys full independence from the executive branch, in conformity with the 
provisions of the Egyptian Constitution, which stipulate full separation between the 
different branches of Government.

<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p> 
137. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for its cooperation and the 
detailed information provided to the allegations relayed to it on 5 May and 12 July 2006. 
He regrets however that his communications of 22 February 2006 and 24 March 2006 have 
remained unanswered and urges the Government to provide at the earliest possible date, 
and preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, detailed 
substantive answers to the allegations relayed in these communications. 
</p>
<p> 
138. Concerning the joint urgent appeal of 5 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur notes 
with appreciation that Judge Mahmoud Maki has been acquitted, while noting with deep 
concern the grounds for his acquittal and the fact that Judge Hisham Bastawissi was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 88 
</p>
<p>censured by the disciplinary board for his comments on the organization of the elections. In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government that judges enjoy 
freedom of expression. The Special Rapporteur is reassured by the assertions of the 
Government that the disciplinary penalty against Judge Bastawissi will not prevent him 
from carrying out his work. However, he would be grateful to the Government for 
providing information on the practical implications of this censure. 
</p>
<p> 
139. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received information about any 
investigation into the assaults against Judge Mahmoud Abdel Latif Hamza by the security 
forces as requested in his letter to the Government and he encourages the Government to do 
so. He would also like to receive the details about the investigations which have led the 
Government to conclude that there was no truth to the complaint by the two Special 
Rapporteurs that judges Nagi Derbala, Ahmed Saber, Ahmed Mekki and Mahmoud 
al-Khudayri were being investigated. The Special Rapporteur will continue to follow up on 
these cases and strongly encourages the Government to pursue its investigation into these 
allegations. 
</p>
<p> 
140. Concerning the communication from the Government of 24 July 2006, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to underline that in accordance with Commission on Human Rights  
resolution 1994/41, his mandate extends to all attacks on the independence of the judiciary. 
In this respect, the Special Rapporteur, while reiterating his concerns about the Judicial 
Authority Law, invites the Government to engage in a constructive dialogue with the 
Special Rapporteur to ensure that the Judicial Authority Law is in full compliance with the 
international standards relating to the administration of justice.

141. On 14 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
 
 &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTS CONCERNED OVER ATTACKS ON 
 EGYPTIAN JUDICIARY  
 
</p>
<p>&#8221;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro 
Despouy, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Human Rights 
Defenders, Hina Jilani, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Ambeyi Ligabo, today expressed 
grave concern over recent attacks against the judiciary in Egypt and the severe 
repression of demonstrations organized by civil society in support of the judiciary. 
The experts also expressed their serious concern with regard to the Egyptian 
Government's decision to transfer two Deputy Heads of the Court of Cassation, 
Judges Mahmoud Mekki and Hisham al- Bastawissi, to the Disciplinary Council. 
They note that on 19 May 2006, the Disciplinary Committee cleared Judge Mekki 
of all charges but found Judge al-Batawissi guilty of disparaging the Supreme 
Judicial Council and talking to the press about political affairs, thereby exposing 
him to be dismissed from the judiciary if he commits another offense and 
preventing him from accessing future promotions. Concern is also<b> </b>expressed that </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 89 
</p>
<p>the Disciplinary Council is headed by the Head of the Court of Cassation 
(appointed by the Minister of Justice) and possesses the power to dismiss judges. 
The independent experts are gravely worried that this decision represents a means 
to punish Judge al-Batawissi for exercising his right to freedom of expression with 
regards to the allegations of widespread electoral fraud during the parliamentary 
elections of 2005 and deter other judges from further action in favor of judicial 
reform. In particular, the independent experts are disturbed by the fact that this 
decision may aim at deterring the other judges whose immunity has also been lifted 
from continuing their calls for amending the Judicial Authority Law to guarantee 
the impartiality and the financial and administrative independence of the judiciary. 
The experts note the concerns expressed by a number of Egyptian judges at 
provisions included in the proposed Judicial Authority Law which reportedly may 
undermine the independence of the judiciary by providing the Minister of Justice 
power to determine the composition of the Supreme Judicial Council, to appoint the 
Head of the Court of Cassation and to decide the budget. Such control of the 
Supreme Judicial Council allows the Minister to influence that body's decisions on 
the appointment, promotion, transfer and discipline of all judges. The experts note 
that Judicial Authority Law will be submitted to the Parliament this week and call 
on the Government to ensure that the judges' proposals are taken into consideration 
and sufficient time is given to members of Parliament to appropriately consider 
their views. The experts also expressed alarm regarding the excessive use of force 
displayed against judges, human rights defenders, journalists and civil society in 
general during their peaceful protests in support of the independence of the 
judiciary and the two investigated judges. In particular, the experts were informed 
that on 18 May 2006, during a peaceful<b> </b>demonstration<b> </b>law enforcement agents 
arrested and struck dozens of protesters and over 240 members of the &#8216;Muslim 
Brotherhood&#8217; and the &#8216;Kifaya&#8217;, in Cairo and Alexandria and deprived<b> </b>several 
journalists of their cameras and beat them. In previous peaceful demonstrations, a 
judge was severely injured by police officers on 25 May 2006. Following another 
peaceful demonstration in support of the independence of the judiciary, severe 
beatings by security agents were reported, in particular political activist Karim 
al-Sha`ir was repeatedly beaten before and during his custody and Mohamed 
al-Sharqawi was beaten and tortured during custody. The disciplinary decision of 
the Government, the proposed Judicial Authority Law and the violent attacks on 
peaceful demonstrators constitute interference with the independence of the 
judiciary and a violation of the freedom of opinion and expression and right to 
protest guaranteed by relevant international human rights instruments, in particular 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 1998 Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders and the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary, which guarantee these rights to judges, human rights defenders and 
journalists. The independent experts reiterate the concern they already expressed to 
the Government on different occasions in the past few months, but in relation to 
which they have received no response. They reaffirm that judges are, like other 
citizens, entitled to freedom of opinion and expression, belief, association and 
assembly, and that they are free to exercise these rights in particular in order to 
represent their interests, to promote their professional training and to protect their </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 90 
</p>
<p>judicial independence. They urge the Government to take all appropriate measures 
to guarantee both these freedoms and the independence of the judiciary, which is a 
fundamental safeguard for justice and for the protection of the human rights of all 
people in Egypt&quot;. 
</p>
<p> 
142. On 14 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
 
 &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERT CONCERNED OVER LAW ON THE JUDICIARY 
 IN EGYPT  
 
</p>
<p> &quot;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro 
 Despouy, today expressed serious concern over a law regulating the judiciary in 
Egypt, which was approved by the Egyptian Parliament on 26 June 2006. 
Promulgation of the law depends now on the will of President Hosni Mubarak. In a 
letter dated 12 July 2006 addressed to President Mubarak, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed his concerns regarding the negative impact of the judicial authority law on 
the independence of the judiciary in Egypt, and urged him to refrain from 
promulgating the law and to send the law back to the Parliament for reconsideration. 
He underlined that, contrary to the process of adoption of the current text, it is 
essential that discussion on a new law take place in consultation with all sectors 
concerned, in particular the Judges' Clubs and experts in constitutional law, whose 
point of view should be duly taken into account. Concerning the text of the law, the 
Special Rapporteur expressed particular concern over the fact that it does not set out 
clear criteria for the selection and appointment of judges and of the Chief Prosecutor, 
that it fails to recognize the right of judges to form and join associations of judges to 
represent their interests and protect their judicial independence, and that it does not 
set out objective criteria for the assignment of cases to judges, which would allow 
heads of courts to assign specific judges to cases against the right of every citizen to 
their natural judge. The law also fails to clearly address the separation between the 
prosecution and the executive power. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is seriously 
concerned by the fact that the law does not provide judges with basic fair trial 
guarantees in the framework of disciplinary procedures. The law prevents judges to 
be represented by a lawyer to defend themselves before a disciplinary court, and does 
not provide them with an effective right to challenge a disciplinary decision before a 
higher court, in breach of the constitutional and internationally recognized right of 
every person to have a judicial decision reviewed by a higher tribunal and to be 
represented by a lawyer of one's own choice before a court.&#8221;

the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative </p>

<p>of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding the situation 
of Tilahun Ayalew, Anteneh Getnet and Meqcha Mengistu, prominent members of the 
Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA), Ethiopia's main teachers&#8217; trade union. Mr. Getnet 
was previously the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders on 28 September 2006. That communication, in which the 
experts brought to the Government&#8217;s attention allegations that Mr. Getnet was abducted 
and beaten by members of the security forces in May 2006 and again abducted and taken to 
an undisclosed location on 23 September 2006, has unfortunately remained without a reply 
from the Government. According to the information recently received, Tilahun Ayalew 
was arrested on 14 December 2006 and Anteneh Getnet on 29 December 2006. Both have 
since been held incommunicado by police at the headquarters of the Central Investigation 
Bureau (Maikelawi) in Addis Ababa. Mr. Ayalew and Mr. Getnet appeared before a judge, 
but they were reportedly neither charged, nor given access to legal counsel or their relatives. 
Since 15 December 2006 Meqcha Mengistu has reportedly been detained by the police at a 
secret location after being under police surveillance for several days. His exact 
whereabouts are not known and the authorities deny all knowledge of his whereabouts. In 
view of their incommunicado detention, concern is expressed as to the physical integrity of 
Tilahun Ayalew, Anteneh Getnet and Meqcha Mengistu. Further concern is expressed that 
their arrest and detention may be related to their legitimate activities in defence of human 
rights, in particular the promotion of labour rights of teachers.

<p> 
144. On 5 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal to the 
Government, together<b> </b>with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, concerning Mesfin Woldermarian, former 
Chair of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council,  Netsanet Demissie, an environmental 
rights lawyer and founder of the Organization for Social Justice in Ethiopia, Daniel Bekele, 
a policy, research and advocacy manager of the non-governmental organization ActionAid, 
and Kassahun Kebede, Chair of the Addis Ababa branch of ETA. Mr. Bekele was the 
subject of an urgent appeal sent jointly by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 25 October 2005, 
and of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 18 November 2005. Mr. 
Demissie was mentioned in the urgent appeal sent on 18 November 2005. According to the 
information received, Mesfin Woldermarian, Netsanet Demissie, Daniel Bekele and 
Kassahun Kebede are currently in prison facing charges of treason. Their trial is due to 
begin in May and if convicted they may face the death penalty. All of the above-mentioned 
people were arrested because of their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in 
2005. Grave concern is expressed that the charges against Mr. Woldermarian, Mr. 
Demissie, Mr. Bekele and Mr. Kebede are connected with their activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular because of their participation in peaceful protests.    </p>

<p><b> 
</b>145. On 8 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning the trial of 76 prisoners, among whom are four human rights 
defenders: Prof. Meslin Wolde Mariam, founder of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council 
(EHRCO), Daniel Bekele from ActionAid, Netsanet Demissie from the Organization for 
Social Justice in Ethiopia and Kassahun Kebede from the Ethiopian Teachers Association. 
There are also several leaders of the opposition coalition, the Coalition for Unity and 
Democracy (CUD), including Berhanu Nega, the elected mayor of Addis Ababa and 
deputy chairman of the opposition party; 14 editors and reporters of independent and 
privately owned newspapers, including  Sarkalem Fasil; academics, lawyers and former 
judges, including Anteneh Mulugeta, a former judge; Birtukan Midela, also a former judge; 
and Yakob Hailemariam, a former prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda and a former United Nations Special Envoy in the Cameroon-Nigeria border 
dispute. Prof. Wolde Mariam was the subject two previous joint urgent appeals sent on 3 
November 2005 and 5 May 2006. Mr. Bekele was the subject of three joint urgent appeals 
sent on 5 May 2006, 18 November 2005 and 25 October 2005. Mr. Nega was the subject of 
a joint urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 3 November 2005, and of an appeal sent by Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 5 January 
2006. Ms. Fasil was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 8 August 2006. 
According to the information received, the trial of the 76 prisoners started on 2 May 2006 
following their arrest in Addis Ababa between 1 and 4 November 2005 by the Federal 
Police and military forces because of their participation in a peaceful demonstration on 15 
May 2005 to contest the results of elections. The accused are reportedly charged with 
&#8220;conspiracy, genocide and treason&#8221;. They have been held in Kaliti jail where 60 prisoners 
were reportedly killed by the police on 2 November 2005. Conditions of detention are 
reportedly very poor: the cells are overcrowded, and some detainees were refused health 
care. Serious concerns have been expressed that the 76 accused may not get a fair trial 
because of their activities in defence of human rights. It has further been reported that the 
defendants faced difficulties in their access to a lawyer. Moreover, Behane Mogese, a 
member of the Ethiopian Bar Association who is acting as a defence lawyer for senior 
opposition leaders from CUD, was allegedly arrested by security forces at his home on 19 
February 2006. He allegedly appeared in court on 6 March 2006, when he was remanded in 
custody for 14 days without charge. On 21 March 2006, he was again brought before the 
court and remanded in custody for 10 more days, as the investigating officers claimed that 
they had not completed their investigation. The experts have learned that in Ethiopia, 
police and security officers are required to be present during the meeting of defence 
lawyers and their clients, and that exchanging communications and documents is 
prohibited. Finally, the experts are deeply concerned about the fact that the right of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 93 
</p>
<p>accused to a fair trial allegedly has not been respected by the courts, which is aggravated by 
the fact that charges against them could lead to the death penalty.

<p> 
146. On 7 June 2006, the Government of Ethiopia replied to the urgent appeal sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on 5 May 2006, stressing that the Government remains fully 
committed to the scrupulous respect of all international conventions and is always ready to 
engage in a constructive dialogue for the fullest realization of the provisions contained 
therein.  The Government acknowledged that the leadership of the main opposition party 
CUD, journalists and others have been arrested and are facing criminal prosecution before 
a court of law for crimes of high treason, outrages against the Constitution and the 
constitutional order, obstruction of the exercise of constitutional powers, armed uprising or 
civil war, impairment of the defensive power of the State and attempted genocide. 
However, it stressed that the accused have not been detained because of their participation 
in pro-democracy demonstrations in 2005, as stated in the allegation, but because of their 
active participation in the street violence that occurred following the May 2005 
demonstrations, which led to numerous fatalities among law enforcement officers and 
civilians as well as to serious destruction of public property. The Government considered 
that these actions were instigated by CUD for the sole purpose of seizing power illegally 
and dismantling the constitutional order through street violence. The Government stated 
that the trial process of the accused began in early January 2006, and is carried out in an 
open, fair and transparent manner in the presence of international observers and with the 
right of the accused to due process of law fully guaranteed.

The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the declaration made by the Government

the accused, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the concerns that he expressed 
in his joint urgent appeal of 8 September 2006, for which he has not received any official

preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, detailed 
substantive answers to the above-mentioned urgent appeal, as well as the one of 9 January 
2006. He would especially appreciate receiving details of any measures taken with a view 
to guaranteeing the accused's right to fair trial.

</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and

several persons detained for the alleged coup attempt of 21 March 2006, including Vincent 
Jatta, Mariam Denton, Ngorr Secka, Foday Barry, Kemo Balajo and Buba Saho. According 
to the information received, 16 persons have been arrested and are detained in connection 
with the alleged attempted coup. They have been charged with treason and conspiracy, 
which carry the death penalty. Their trial was adjourned first to 26 May and then to 2 June. 
At least eight other persons are detained without charge, some of them incommunicado. 
They include: former chief of staff Lieutenant-Colonel Vincent Jatta, senior lawyer 
Mariam Denton, former National Intelligence Agency (NIA) Acting Deputy Director 
General Ngorr Secka, NIA Director of Operations Foday Barry, former NIA senior officer 
Kemo Balajo, and NIA official Buba Saho. While Mariam Denton&#8217;s lawyers had 
previously not been able to meet with her, they have now been authorized to do so. 
However, it is alleged that other lawyers have been denied access to their clients, or could 
not meet with them in private. Moreover, on 14 May, reporter Lamin Fatty was charged 
with publishing false information in relation to an article he wrote which suggested that a 
high-ranking official was among those arrested for the alleged coup attempt in March. 
Despite the apology published by his newspaper, Lamin Fatty continues to face those 
charges. He has not yet appeared in court.

150. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply and urges the 
Government of the Gambia to provide substantive answers to the above allegations at the 
earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human 
Rights Council. However, non-governmental sources have informed the Special 
Rapporteur of the release of lawyer Mariam Denton, without charge, on 25 July, as well as 
the release on bail of Lamin Fatty, on 12 June 2006. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
these releases, but was distressed to learn that Lamin Fatty was detained for 63 days at NIA 
headquarters without access to a lawyer and without being brought to court. He also 
remains concerned that Lamin Fatty is still charged under section 181 of the Criminal Code, 
which makes the publication of &quot;false information&quot; a criminal and punishable offence and 
under which he faces a minimum of six months in jail without the option of a fine if 
convicted. The Special Rapporteur has learned that his trial began in June before the 
Kanifing Magistrate's Court in Serrekunda, but has been adjourned five times because of 
the absence of the prosecution. The defence counsel, Lamin Camara, applied for the case to 
be struck down and his client discharged because of &quot;too much delay&quot; by the prosecution, 
but the magistrate denied the application on the grounds that the prosecution still needed to 
be given time. It has been reported that following the appointment of the trial magistrate, 
Kebba Sanyang, as Gambia's Attorney-General and Secretary of State for Justice, the 
hearing was to start anew on 4 December 2006. The Special Rapporteur was also informed </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 95 
</p>
<p>that 22 people are still detained in relation to the alleged coup. On 18 July, four of the six 
defence lawyers representing the defendants charged with treason reportedly withdrew 
from the trial with the consent of their clients, owing to their concerns that the trial may not 
be fair. These defendants are now potentially without legal representation, and may find it 
difficult to engage new lawyers due to the high-profile, politically sensitive nature of the 
case. The Special Rapporteur therefore urges the Government to provide details of these 
cases and to ensure that all 22 detainees, in particular those charged with crimes that carry 
the death penalty, have adequate legal representation at all stages of the proceedings 
against them. The Special Rapporteur also urges the authorities to give all the detainees 
regular access to their families, lawyers and any medical attention they may require.

Ms. Bekauri received an anonymous threatening telephone call.  GYLA immediately 
called for an official investigation into the incident, but has not received a reply from the

Unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia opened criminal case No. 012060892. 
The investigation was started under article 151 of the Criminal Code of Georgia into the 
fact of alleged threats made against Ms. Lela Bekauri. In course of the investigation, 
relevant investigative activities have been carried out, namely, Ms. Bekauri was 
questioned and given the status of victim in accordance with the criminal legislation of

and military officials of the United States of America, including Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld. According to the information received, the criminal complaint was filed 
with the German Federal Prosecutor&#8217;s office at the Karlsruhe Court by the Berlin attorney 
Wolfgang Kaleck of the Republican Attorneys' Association, the New York-based Center 
for Constitutional Rights, the International Federation for Human Rights and Lawyers 
Against the War, on behalf of first four and later 17 Iraqi plaintiffs who allege they were 
the victims of very serious crimes amounting to torture, including severe beatings, sleep 
and food deprivation, hooding and sexual abuse, when they were detained in Iraq by the 
United States military.  The complaint was filed under the German Code of Crimes against 
International Law (hereinafter &#8220;the German Code&#8221;). The charges include violations of the 
German Code which outlaws killing, torture, cruel and inhumane treatment, sexual 
coercion and forcible transfers.  The German Code reportedly makes criminally 
responsible those who carry out such acts as well as those who induce, condone or order 
the acts. It also makes commanders liable, whether civilian or military, who fail to prevent 
their subordinates from committing such acts. The German Code reportedly grants German 
courts what is called universal jurisdiction for the above-described crimes, in light of 
article 1, part 1, section 1 of the Code, which states: &quot;This Act shall apply to all criminal 
offences against international law designated under this Act, to serious criminal offences 
designated therein even when the offence was committed abroad and bears no relation to 
Germany.&#8221; This is said to mean that those who commit serious crimes under this Act can 
be prosecuted, wherever found. Therefore, the German Code reportedly places a 
prosecuting duty on the German prosecutor for all such crimes, irrespective of the location 
of the person, the crime, or the nationality of the persons involved. According to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 97 
</p>
<p>information received, mainly originating from non-governmental organizations and the 
press, following the filing of the complaint,  strong pressure was exercised by the United 
States of America on Germany to obtain the dismissal of the complaint. Such pressures 
included open threats to the effect that the bilateral relations between the two countries 
could be at risk if the complaint was not dismissed. In addition, the Pentagon was said to 
have openly threatened the German prosecution by indicating that Donald Rumsfeld would 
not attend the Munich Security Conference in February 2005 if the complaint was not 
dismissed. On 10 February 2005, two days before the Conference, the German prosecutor 
issued a decision to dismiss the case, thereby allowing Secretary Rumsfeld to attend. The 
Special Rapporteur expressed deep concern that a decision by the prosecutor on a case 
involving such serious crimes has been taken in a context of strong political pressure 
exerted by the country of citizenship of the defendants. He noted that it was difficult to 
believe that whereas the prosecutor had been seized of the matter for little more than two 
months, the decision to dismiss the complaint came just two days before the Munich 
Conference, just in time to allow the Secretary of Defense to attend. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur expressed concerned about the weakness of the legal justification of the 
dismissal. The prosecutor justified the dismissal by alleging that by virtue of the principle 
of subsidiarity, the German system should only prosecute under universal jurisdiction 
when the State first called upon to adjudicate (in this case the State of citizenship of the 
defendants), or an international court, is unwilling or unable to prosecute, and that in this 
case there are no indications that the authorities of the United States of America are 
refraining or would refrain from prosecuting the violations described in the complaint. 
According to the prosecutor, the prosecution of the violations is therefore left to the judicial 
authorities of the United States of America, and he therefore dismissed the case. In relation 
to this analysis, to the Special Rapporteur emphasized that the criminal procedures against 
low-ranking figures for crimes committed in Abu Ghraib and other detention facilities 
have shown the unwillingness of the military criminal justice system to look into the 
involvement of those higher up the chain of command. Moreover, in the United States of 
America&#8217;s military criminal justice system, the main defendant, Donald Rumsfeld, sits as 
the ultimate convening authority; therefore, the basic requirements for an independent trial 
cannot be fulfilled. Also, the Congress of the United States of America, vested by the 
Constitution with oversight authority, failed to seriously investigate the abuses and none of 
the various commissions appointed by the military and the Bush administration has been 
willing to investigate higher up the chain of command to consider what criminal 
responsibility lies with the military and political leadership. Finally, there are no 
international or Iraqi courts that can carry out investigations and prosecutions since the 
United States of America has not joined the International Criminal Court, thereby 
foreclosing the option of pursuing a prosecution in international courts, and Iraq has no 
authority to prosecute since the United States of America gave immunity to all its 
personnel in Iraq from Iraqi prosecution. In the light of the elements mentioned above, 
which suggest that the prosecutorial authority would have failed to act in an impartial, 
independent and objective manner, the Special Rapporteur expressed his deep concern 
regarding the violation of the principle of the independence of the judiciary as enshrined in 
recognized international norms and standards, including article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary, in particular principle 1, which states &#8220;The independence of the judiciary shall </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 98 
</p>
<p>be guaranteed by the State and enshrined in the Constitution or the law of the country. It is 
the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence 
of the judiciary, and principle 4, which states &#8220;There shall not be any inappropriate or 
unwarranted interference with the judicial process&#8221;.  In addition, guideline 4 of the 
Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors  stipulates that &#8220;States shall ensure that prosecutors 
are able to perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, 
harassment, improper interference or unjustified exposure to civil, penal or other liability&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
155. Moreover, the elements mentioned above, added to the unusually short length of 
the decision to dismiss and the lack of reference to the extensive arguments and documents 
submitted by the plaintiffs, suggest that the prosecutor has failed to comply with his 
obligations of independence, impartiality and objectivity, in particular as set out under 
guideline 13 which states: &#8220;In the performance of their duties, prosecutors shall:  (a) carry 
out their functions impartially and avoid all political, social, religious, racial, cultural, 
sexual or any other kind of discrimination; (b) protect the public interest, act with 
objectivity, take proper account of the position of the suspect and the victim, and pay 
attention to all relevant circumstances, irrespective of whether they are to the advantage or 
disadvantage of the suspect&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur pointed out that such duties are even 
more compelling when the crimes to be prosecuted are committed by public officials and 
still more so when they relate to grave violation of human rights, as set out in guideline 15, 
which states: &#8220;Prosecutors shall give due attention to the prosecution of crimes committed 
by public officials, particularly corruption, abuse of power, grave violations of human 
rights and other crimes recognized by international law and, where authorized by law or 
consistent with local practice, the investigation of such offences&#8221;.

<p><b> 
</b>156. On 22 August 2006 the Government of Germany replied to the allegation letter sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on 13 July 2006. The Government stated that on 29 November 
2004, Berlin attorney Wolfgang Kaleck filed a criminal complaint on behalf of the United 
States Center for Constitutional Rights and 17 Iraqi nationals against Secretary of Defense 
Donald Rumsfeld and others relating to alleged offences under the German Code of Crimes 
against International Law (CCAIL). The way in which this complaint was dealt with by the 
Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice, the public prosecutor 
responsible for prosecuting crimes under the CCAIL, was in accordance with German law. 
Contrary to the assumption made by the Special Rapporteur, the Public Prosecutor General 
of the Federal Court of Justice was not in fact issued with any instructions by the Federal 
Ministry of Justice, nor was any other influence exerted on him by the Federal Government 
to persuade him not to launch investigations into the occurrences at Abu Ghraib. The 
Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice based his decision of 10 February 
2005 not to follow up on the complaint on section 153f of the German Code of Criminal 
Procedure (<i>Strafprozessordnung </i>&#8211; StPO), which relates to the principle of universal 
jurisdiction found in the CCAIL, and which states that under certain conditions the 
prosecutor has discretion to refrain from starting an investigation. The Public Prosecutor 
General published the full reasons for this step in a press release. The complainants' appeal 
against the non-instigation of an investigation was rejected by the Higher Regional Court </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 99 
</p>
<p>in Stuttgart on 13 September 2005. Irrespective of the fact that in this particular case the 
Public Prosecutor General's decision not to launch an investigation had not been taken 
pursuant to instructions or under undue influence, it should be noted that the fact that 
public prosecutors in Germany are as a matter of principle subject to instructions is in line 
with the relevant United Nations instruments and guidelines.  
 
157. With respect to universal jurisdiction under the CCAIL and the principle of 
subsidiarity, the Government stated that while universal jurisdiction applies to offences 
under the CCAIL, which means that no link of any kind to Germany is required for 
prosecutions under that Act, it does not legitimate prosecutions unconditionally and 
without further ado. The aim of the CCAIL is to put an end to impunity. This must, 
however, be done against the backdrop of non-interference in the affairs of other States. 
This conclusion is also to be drawn from article 17 of the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, in the light of which the CCAIL is to be read. The German legislator did 
not make allowances for subsidiarity in the CCAIL itself; no exceptions to universal 
jurisdiction were made. Rather, universal jurisdiction was made the general rule and the 
principle of subsidiarity, enshrined in the Rome Statute, was taken account of by means of 
a procedural rule inserted into the StPO as section 153f at the time of adoption of the 
CCAIL. The Rome Statute is used as an interpretive aid for the application of the German 
CCAIL. The duty to prosecute crimes under the CCAIL is thus not absolute if other 
jurisdictions are called upon to act. In the first instance, the country where the offences 
were committed or the State of citizenship of the defendants or victims, or a competent 
international court, should act. The jurisdiction of unrelated third-party States is to be 
viewed as a fallback jurisdiction designed to avoid impunity, but it should not 
unreasonably sideline the primary forums. 
 
158. The decision taken by the Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice 
within his discretion on the basis of these conditions was also found by the Higher 
Regional Court in Stuttgart to be subject to no fault on points of law (decision of 13 
September 2005). The Stuttgart Higher Regional Court examined whether the conditions 
set out in section 153f were fulfilled and affirmed that they were, and also considered 
whether the Public Prosecutor General had properly exercised the discretion given to him 
for this purpose or whether he had overstepped the line and acted arbitrarily. The Higher 
Regional Court in Stuttgart held that the Public Prosecutor General&#8217;s decision which was 
the subject of the complaint was not arbitrary, nor was it outside his discretion. 
 
159. The position of Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Offices in Germany is in conformity with the 
requirements of United Nations instruments and guidelines. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office in Germany is an organ of the criminal justice system, equal in rank to the courts. It 
is charged with investigating crimes and presenting cases in court. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office puts the criminal courts in a position to exercise their judicial powers, and is thus 
part of the judicial system, without having judicial powers of its own. Insofar as it is 
mandatory for the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to prosecute certain offences, and it has a 
monopoly on bringing prosecutions, it acts as a &quot;guardian of the law&quot;. Its duty to prosecute 
ensures that the law is applied uniformly and fairly and prevents arbitrariness. Public 
prosecutors are not independent, as are the judiciary, but are bound by the instructions of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 100 
</p>
<p>their superiors (and ultimately the Minister of Justice) and are thus to that extent part of the 
executive. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office is accountable to parliament through the 
Minister of Justice, who is also under the same duty to ensure that prosecutions are brought. 
This system of accountability is supported by the general instructions that prosecutors must 
abide by, as well as by reporting duties and instructions in specific cases. These controls 
are in conformity with the relevant United Nations instruments and guidelines. Also, 
neither the European Convention on Human Rights nor article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates that prosecutors must be independent and 
cannot be given orders by their superiors. As regards the Guidelines on the Role of 
Prosecutors, it should be clearly stated that the inclusion of the list of means of exerting 
undue pressure does not mean that prosecuting agencies must in all situations be entirely 
independent and subject to no instructions from superiors whatsoever.

<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>160. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its cooperation and for the 
information it provided in its reply of 22 August 2006. He notes with concern that the 
alleged perpetrators of the violations referred to in his allegation letter of 13 July 2006 have 
still not been prosecuted in the United States of America, and that on the contrary new 
legislation has been adopted in that country which practically impedes the prosecution of 
public officials suspected of being responsible for those acts. In light of this development, 
he notes that a new complaint has been submitted to the German prosecutor by the 
plaintiffs. In this context, the Special Rapporteur hopes that this compliant will be 
considered with the required independence, in accordance with applicable international 
norms and standards.

</b>161. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning Theo Alexandridis, legal counsel with the Greek Helsinki Monitor 
(GHM), and other staff members of GHM. GHM is an organization that monitors and 
reports on human rights violations in Greece, including violations against the Roma 
community. According to the information received, on 19 April 2005 the Greek Minister of 
Health and the Secretary-General of Social Solidarity publicly accused non-governmental 
organizations of &#8220;existing only on paper&#8221; and of &#8220;publishing negative reports on the basis 
of unreliable, exaggerated and misleading information on the victims of the smuggling of 
human beings in Greece, in order to obtain an increase in funding from the Greek Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs&#8221;. It is reported that GHM was specifically named in these accusations. It 
is further reported that GHM lodged a complaint against the Minister of Health and the 
Secretary-General of Social Solidarity. On 13 October 2005 Mr. Alexandridis was arrested 
and detained in the Psair neighbourhood of Aspropyrgos, near Athens. It is reported that 
Mr. Alexandridis had gone to the police station to lodge a complaint against parents of non- 
Roma children who had allegedly committed violent acts against demonstrators protesting </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 101 
</p>
<p>the expulsion of Roma children from a school in the area. After he had filed the complaint, 
Mr. Alexandridis was told that he was under arrest and was detained for four hours before 
being released without charge. Moreover, the President of the Parents Association 
allegedly lodged a complaint against Mr. Alexandridis for &#8220;libel&#8221; and &#8220;defamation&#8221;. It is 
reported that on 20 January 2006 the Head of the Appeals Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, during a 
radio interview, stated that all Roma are criminals and announced that &#8220;perpetrators, 
instigators and accomplices&#8221; of Roma people who had helped them in a case concerning 
the alleged forced expulsion of Roma families in the Makrigianni area of the city of Patras 
would be &#8220;called on to take the stand&#8221;, specifically naming representatives of GHM.  The 
Head of the Appeals Prosecutor&#8217;s Office also reportedly stated that he had opened an 
inquiry into the involvement of GHM in petitioning the First Instance Prosecutor to open a 
criminal investigation into alleged illegal evictions and attacks against Roma people in 
Makrigianni. Concern is expressed that the above-mentioned events are connected with the 
legitimate activities of Mr. Alexandridis and GHM in defence of human rights, in 
particular because of their involvement in defending the legal rights of the Roma 
community in Greece.

del Secretario-General para los defensores de los derechos humano, envi&#243; un llamamiento 
urgente en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas y los hostigamientos en contra el personal de la 
Asociaci&#243;n para una Sociedad m&#225;s Justa (ASJ) incluyendo la Se&#241;ora Dina Meetabel Meza 
Elvir, periodista y coordinadora de proyectos de la ASJ, y sus miembros, el Se&#241;or Dionisio

Se&#241;ora Rosa Moraz&#225;n y el Se&#241;or Robert Mar&#237;n. La ASJ es una organizaci&#243;n no 
gubernamental en Tegucigalpa que representa y trabaja por las v&#237;ctimas de violaciones de 
los derechos humanos; en particular, los derechos econ&#243;micos y sociales. De acuerdo con 
la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 19 de septiembre el propietario de una empresa de seguridad 
privada Delta Security y su empresa filial Seguridad T&#233;cnica de Honduras (SETECH), con 
algunos de sus empleados, habr&#237;an llegado a la oficina de la ASJ en veh&#237;culos sin placas y 
con vidrios polarizados.  El motivo supuesto de la visita habr&#237;a sido el de &#8220;negociar&#8221; los 
t&#233;rminos de un caso en el cual la ASJ representa a 12 guardias, v&#237;ctimas de un despido 
ilegal ocurrido en agosto de 2006.  Seg&#250;n los informes, el propietario habr&#237;a amenazado a 
la Sra. Dina Meetabel Meza Elvir dici&#233;ndole que tomar&#237;a las medidas necesarias para

171. On 1 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
concerning Parvez Imroz, a lawyer and member of the Council of the Asian Federation 
Against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAD), President of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) and Patron of the Association of Parents of 
Disappeared Persons (APDP). AFAD is a federation of NGOs that work against enforced 
or involuntary disappearances, JKCCS is a coalition of NGOs that work on human rights 
and democracy in Kashmir and APDP is an NGO that works against enforced or 
involuntary disappearances in Jammu and Kashmir and is a member of AFAD and JKCCS. 
Mr. Imroz was already the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 11 May 2005 and an 
urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
on 5 October 2004, to which the Government replied by letter dated 15 February 2005. 
According to the information received, in November 2004 Mr. Imroz sent an application 
for a passport to the passport authority of Jammu and Kashmir. He has received no formal 
response or rejection from the authorities, despite having sent a number of reminders. 
Without a passport Mr. Imroz has been unable to attend a number of international 
conferences, workshops and consultations connected with his activities as a human rights 
defender. Concern is expressed that the refusal by the authorities to issue Parvez Imroz 
with a passport may be connected with his activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular his work on involuntary and enforced disappearances in Kashmir, and may 
represent an attempt to prevent him from being able to meet and communicate with other 
international human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> 
172. On 14 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent another joint urgent appeal 
together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders<b> </b>regarding Parvez Imroz. Still without a passport, Mr. Imroz will 
not be able to go to France on 13 October 2006 to receive the Ludovic Trarieux 
international human rights prize, which was awarded to him jointly by the Bordeaux Bar, 
the Brussels Bar, the Paris Bar and the Human Rights Institute of the European Bar. The 
prize, created in 1984, is awarded every year to a lawyer for activities defending human 
rights. According to the award&#8217;s rules, the prizewinner must attend the award ceremony, 
which takes place in Bordeaux at the National School of the Magistracy. Concern is 
expressed that the refusal by the authorities to issue a passport to Mr. Imroz may be 
connected with his activities as a lawyer and human rights defender, in particular his work 
related to involuntary and enforced disappearances in Kashmir, and may represent an 
attempt to prevent him from being able to meet and communicate with other international 
human rights defenders. </p>

175. On 3 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the 
trial relating to the attack on 29 November 2005 on three hamlets, Karama, Bonto Badong 
and Ujung Moncong, in Bandri Manurung village, Jeneponto Regency, Sulawesi, by  
members of the military forces, in which 82 houses were destroyed and civilians were 
injured.  On 16 January 2006, three soldiers, Private Siradjuddin, Private Jusmianto and 
Chief Private Alimuddin, who were allegedly involved in the attack were sentenced to 2 &#189; 
months&#8217; imprisonment by Military Court 316, Makassar, South Sulawesi. They were 
convicted under article 160 of the Criminal Code of Indonesia for inciting people to 
commit unlawful acts in public and under article 406 (1) of the Criminal Code for inciting 
people to destruction. It is reported that despite the perpetrators&#8217; direct involvement in the 
destruction of the houses and attacks against civilians, they were only charged with 
incitement to unlawful acts, which resulted in a lenient sentence. The three convicted 
soldiers are still believed to be serving in the military.  Second Private Kopoda Syarifuddin, 
who reportedly stabbed a civilian with a sword and severely injured him during the same 
incident, was sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment by the military court. It is alleged that 
civilians were not able to access the military court because the hearings were conducted 
behind closed doors. Finally, there was no decision by the court regarding compensation to 
the victims of the attack. The military has reportedly rebuilt a small number of the 
destroyed houses and paid some money to the villagers.

<p><b> 
</b>176. On 21 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a urgent appeal jointly with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression regarding Selpius Bobii, a 27-year-old student at the Catholic Theological 
College &#8220;Fajar Timur&#8221;, Jayapura, Papua, as well as 57 detainees. According to the 
allegations received, on 16 March 2006, they were arrested and detained in Jayapura Police 
Station and are denied access to lawyers. Students were protesting in Abepura to demand 
the closure of mining operations in Timika, West Papua, and the withdrawal of the 
Indonesian Army and police, which provide security for the mining company. The 
protesters blocked the main road of Jayapura so as to attract the attention of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 106 
</p>
<p>Government and the mining company. The police instructed them to clear the roads, 
deploying water cannon and armoured vehicles. It is reported that Special Mobile Police 
Brigade officers used tear gas and fired on the crowd of unarmed demonstrators. In 
response, the protesters threw stones, bottles and pieces of wood at the police. In the 
violence that ensued, it was reported that four policemen were killed and about nine were 
wounded. Moreover, the following individuals were among those treated in the Dian 
Harapan Catholic Hospital, Waena, Jayapura: Etinus Kulla, a university student; Obatius 
Wanimbo, a university student, treated for severe gunshot wounds; Ishak Ulmami, 
university student, treated for gunshot; John Giyai, a university student, treated for a 
gunshot wound; Hermanus Maiseny, a high school student, in critical condition with a

177. On 3 May 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal of 21 March 
2006 acknowledging that on 16 March 2006, the forces of order clashed with protestors 
who were organizing a demonstration in Abepura to launch their opposition to several 
issues, including demanding the closure of the United States-owned Freeport McMoran 
copper and gold mines and operations. The clash occurred when police tried to persuade 
the demonstrators blocking access to the main road to disperse and the demonstrators, 
ignoring the police, instead threw stones and other objects, mortally wounded four 
policemen and an Air Force officer. About 29 were injured and rushed to Abepura hospital 
in Papua. Faced with the spectre of  spreading violence, the police, in accordance with the 
existing law, arrested 76 demonstrators, among whom it identified only 17 as suspects. 
One of them was Selpius Bobil, the head of the West Papua Referendum Front, who was 
taken for questioning about his role as instigator in the final outcome of events. However, 
only 12, and not 57 individuals as alleged in the letter, were also arrested by the police at 
the Jayapura Police Headquarters as the ongoing investigation into the cause of death and 
injury resulting from the clashed continue. The Government assured the Special 
Rapporteur that as set forth in the national legislation, each suspect was granted the right to 
be visited by family members and religious figures and the right to be accompanied by 
lawyers at all levels of the investigation who, contrary to allegations, had authority to act 
on their behalf. These were lawyers from the Coalition of Non-Governmental 
Organizations and included Pieter Eli, SH; Paskalis Letson SH; L. Anum Siregar, SH; 
Adolf Waramori, SH; Iwan K.Niode, SH; Rahman Ramili, SH; Robert Korwa, SH;

<p> 
178. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Indonesia for its cooperation 
and the information provided to his joint urgent appeal of 21 March 2006. However, he 
regrets that the allegation letter of 3 March 2006 has remained so far unanswered and urges 
the Government of Indonesia to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably before 
the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, detailed substantive answers to 
the allegations relayed in that communication. Concerning the joint urgent appeal of 21 
March 2006, the Special Rapporteur would be most interested in receiving the findings of 
the National Human Rights Commission after its visits to the detainees at Police 
Headquarters. He notes with appreciation that the suspects have been accompanied by 
lawyers at all levels of the investigation. The Special Rapporteur would also like to receive 
details about the measures taken by the Government to ensure that no limit is placed on 
communication between the lawyers and their clients. Taking note of the committment of 
the Government to bring the detainees before a court in due time, he would like to know if 
the trial has started.

</b>179. On 1 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with  
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, the independent expert on minority issues<b>, </b>the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture concerning 173 members of the Nematollah Sufi Muslim community.  
According to the information received, on 13 February 2006, they were arrested for their 
participation in a peaceful protest, which was reportedly violently suppressed by the 
security forces and members of the Hojatieh and Fatemiyon pro-Government groups.  The 
demonstration was held to protest an order by the security forces to evacuate the 
community's place of worship, known as Hosseiniye.  The 173 individuals are reportedly 
being interrogated at Fajr Prison in Qom and there are concerns that they are being tortured 
in order to force them to sign pre-prepared false confessions, stating that the protest had 
political motivations and was linked to anti-Government groups.  The relatives of the 
detainees have been unable to obtain official information about their whereabouts and the 
detainees have not had access to lawyers.  According to the information received, lawyer 
Bahman Nazari, was arrested when he approached officials in an attempt to represent the 
detainees. The protest began on 9 February 2006.  On 13 February 2006, there were 
hundreds of protesters present in and around the Hosseiniye.  At about 3 p.m. the security 
forces set a deadline for the protesters to evacuate the Hosseiniye. Members of the 
Fatemiyon and Hojatieh groups also reportedly surrounded the place of worship, shouting 
slogans such as &#8220;Death to Sufis&#8221; and &#8220;Sufism is a British plot&#8221;, and distributed leaflets </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 108 
</p>
<p>alleging that Sufis are enemies of Islam. The security forces moved in at about 4 p.m. and 
stormed the building, using tear gas and explosives.  They beat many of the protesters.  The 
next day the Hosseiniye was demolished by bulldozers.  Approximately 1,200 protesters 
were arrested and taken away on buses to unknown locations. The detainees were 
interrogated and, according to the information received, many were subjected to torture or 
ill-treatment.  Most of them were subsequently released.  However, 173 are still being held.  
Those who were released were required to sign a paper as a condition of their release 
agreeing not to attend any Sufi gatherings in Qom.  Some were reportedly required to sign 
documents renouncing Sufism.  Arrest warrants have reportedly been issued for the main 
Sufi preacher in Qom, Seyed Ahmadi Shariati, and the four lawyers who had previously 
been acting on behalf of the group, Eslami, Omid Behrouzi, Gholamreza Harsimi and 
Farshid Yadollahi.  The incident occurred amid concerns about an increasing demonization 
of the Sufi Muslim group.  In September 2005, a religious jurist in Qom, Ayatollah Hossein 
Nouri-Hamedani, called for a crackdown on Sufi groups in Qom. 
</p>
<p>   
180. On 31 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Abdolfattah Soltani, an Iranian defence lawyer and a 
founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre who was arrested on 30 July 
2005. Mr. Soltani was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 4 August 2005 and an 
urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 14 December 2005. 
According to the information received, Mr. Soltani has still not been informed of the 
charges brought against him, in violation of article 14, paragraph 3, of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party. It 
is alleged that on 3 December 2005, Sa&#239;d Mortazavi, General Prosecutor of Tehran, 
decided to replace the investigating judge who had just announced to Mr. Soltani&#8217;s lawyers 
that he would recommend his release on bail. The newly appointed judge decided, on the 
same day, that Mr. Soltani should remain in custody for a further period of three months. 
Such replacement raises concerns with regard to the independence of the judiciary in this 
case.  Mr. Soltani was released on 6 March 2006 after posting bail of &#8364;100,000 - an 
unusually high amount, which was paid by a solidarity movement. It is reported that Mr. 
Soltani will be tried on 5 April 2006 before the Islamic Revolutionary Court of Tehran. 
However, his lawyers have not been granted access to the criminal prosecution file.  
During his detention in solitary confinement in Evin Prison in Tehran, Mr. Soltani could 
only meet one of his lawyers in January 2006, more than six months after his arrest. These 
would be serious violations of the fair trial guarantees. It is also alleged that Mr. Soltani's 
prosecution is motivated by his role as a defence lawyer in a case where Mr. Soltani 
questioned the role of the prosecutor in the death in Evin Prison of Ms. Zahra Kazemi, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 109 
</p>
<p>which would constitute a clear violation of articles 16, 18 and 20 of the Basic Principles on 
the Role of Lawyers.  Lastly, it was reported that Mr. Soltani received an official letter 
from the judiciary rejecting his election as a member of the board of the Tehran Bar 
Association, on the grounds that his candidacy was not valid since he was in prison during 
the election. It is recalled that Mr. Soltani has not been deprived of his civil and political 
rights and is to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. The above-mentioned letter is 
considered to be an inappropriate intervention by the judiciary in the election process of the 
Tehran Bar Association, which would constitute interference with the independence of 
lawyers, as well as an act of judicial harassment against Mr. Soltani. 
</p>
<p> 
181. On 31 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences regarding 
Fatemeh Haghighat-Pajouh, who was sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of her 
husband, a drug addict who had tried to rape her 15-year-old daughter. Fatemeh 
Haghighat-Pajouh was already the subject of an urgent appeal by the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequencesw on 11 
February 2005 and by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions on 12 October 2004. Those communications drew the attention of the 
Government to the fact that that Ms. Haghighat-Pajouh reportedly did not have access to 
adequate legal assistance in the course of her trial. The experts appreciate the responses of 
the Government (dated 21 October 2004 and 27 May 2005) and welcome the review of her 
case by the local judicial authority and the likelihood of a clemency order from the Head of 
the Judiciary. However, they have recently been informed that her stay of execution has 
been rescinded by the Supreme Court and that her execution is reportedly scheduled to take 
place on or before 1 April 2006.  
</p>
<p> 
182. On 22 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding 52 members of the Nematollahi Sufi Muslim community and their 
two lawyers, Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi. They are among 173 members of the 
Nematollah Sufi Muslim community who were arrested on 13 February 2006 for their 
participation in a peaceful protest against an order by the security forces to evacuate the 
community's place of worship, known as Hosseiniye, and were the subject of the 
communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, the independent expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture on 1 March 2006 (see above), to which no response has been 
received. According to new information, on 3 May 2006, 52 members of the Nematollahi </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 110 
</p>
<p>Sufi Muslim community and their lawyers Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi were 
convicted on charges of &quot;disobeying the orders of government officials&quot; and &quot;disturbing 
public order&quot;. For the former charge, 25 individuals were reportedly fined 10 million rials 
(equivalent to more than US$ 1,000) and the rest were fined 5 million rials. For the latter 
charge, they were sentenced to one year&#8217;s imprisonment and 74 lashes. After their release, 
they would be obliged to report to security officials every month for two years. It is further 
reported that Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi were barred from practising their 
profession for five years. All of them were released on bail, and were given 20 days to 
appeal the judgement. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>183. On 20 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding Saleh Kamrani, a lawyer, residing at 23 Zanbagh 17, Azimiyeh neighbourhood, 
Besat Square, Karaj. According to the information received, on 14 June 2006 at between 4 
and 5 p.m, Mr. Kamrani disappeared on his way home from his office located at Unit 6-25 
Rasht Valley, South Karghar St., Tehran. On the same day, relatives of Mr. Kamrani 
contacted the police (Emergency Police, Kalantary and Niruye Entezami), the Intelligence 
Services (Etelaat), hospitals and the highway patrol, but no news of Mr. Kamrani was 
received. On 17 or 18 June, however, relatives discovered that Mr. Kamrani is detained at 
Evin Prison, where he is held without charges and without access to his family. Mr. 
Kamrani did not have access to his lawyer on the first days of his detention, and it is 
unknown whether this access has now been granted. The experts are concerned that the 
arrest of Saleh Kamrani could be in reprisal for his activity as a lawyer defending Iranian 
Azeri Turks allegedly detained in connection with their political or cultural activities. 
Moreover, in view of his detention incommunicado, they are concerned that he might be at 
risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. The concerns for his physical integrity are 
heightened by reports that he needs medication for a heart condition.  
</p>
<p> 
184. On 10 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention regarding Saleh 
Kamrani. Mr. Kamrani has already been the subject of a joint communication by the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 20 
June 2006 (see above). According to the information received, Mr. Kamrani has been in 
detention since 14 June 2006. He is being held in Branch 14 of the Interrogation Centre of 
the Revolutionary Court of Tehran. He was due to be set free on 3 July 2006 upon posting 
bail. However, once his wife had collected the money for the bail, which the court 
increased from 100 million to 500 million rials, the court added another prerequisite for his 
release:  the judge in charge of the case had to be in attendance, which could not take place 
until 4 July 2006. Mr. Kamrani was not however released on 4 July, and his wife was told 
to come back on 6 July. On 6 July, the judge once again disregarded his own decision and 
issued a new decision to continue the detention of Mr. Kamrani for further interrogation, 
and without setting a time for his release on bail. Since Mr. Kamrani has been arrested and 
detained, his wife has been allowed to visit him only once. During this same period Mr. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 111 
</p>
<p>Kamrani&#8217;s lawyer was refused permission to visit him, has still had no access to the files 
concerning the arrest and detention of his client, and was not notified of any formal charges 
against his client, on the grounds that Mr. Kamrani would be released soon and therefore 
needed no lawyer. Ms. Kamrani was informed that her husband would be held for &quot;taking 
steps for the overthrow of the system by way of publicity against the system&quot;. 
</p>
<p> 
185. On 8 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders concerning Abdolfattah Soltani, an Iranian lawyer and 
a founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre who was arrested on 30 July 
2005. Mr. Soltani was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 31 March 2006 (see above) 
and 4 August 2005 and an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 14 
December 2005. According to the information received, Abdolfattah Soltani was notified 
on 16 July 2006 that the Revolutionary Court of Tehran condemned him to a five-year 
prison term and to the loss of his civic rights for non-respect of the confidentiality of the 
preliminary investigation in a politically sensitive case in which he was the defendant&#8217;s 
lawyer. Mr. Soltani appealed this decision. The experts are seriously concerned that Mr. 
Soltani's prosecution is motivated by his plea in a case related to the death of an 
Iranian-Canadian photographer, Ms. Zahra Kazemi, in Evin Prison, wherein Mr. Soltani 
questioned the fairness of the judicial proceedings and the lack of proper investigations, 
including the role of the Tehran Prosecutor, in her death. They are also particularly 
concerned by the fact that the procedure which led to the ruling against Mr. Soltani 
comprised serious violations of fair trial guarantees. As indicated in the previous letters, for 
more than six months after his arrest, Mr. Soltani was detained in solitary confinement in 
Evin Prison and was denied access to a lawyer. He could only meet one of his lawyers in 
January 2006. Moreover, it has been reported that his lawyer was not granted access to the 
criminal prosecution file. Furthermore, Mr. Soltani was allegedly subjected to acts of 
judicial harassment. On 3 December 2005, his preliminary detention was extended by three 
months, despite the fact that the investigating judge had recommended that he be released 
on bail. Indeed, it is reported that the Tehran Prosecutor, who had issued the arrest warrant 
against Mr. Soltani, subsequently replaced the investigating judge, leading to the extended 
detention.  
</p>
<p> 
186. On 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and<b> </b>the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders<b> </b>regarding the ban of the non-governmental organization Defenders 
of Human Rights Centre (DHRC). DHRC, co-founded in 2002 by Ms. Shirin Ebadi, 
Iranian lawyer and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, aims to provide legal counsel </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 112 
</p>
<p>to dissidents, journalists and students facing prosecution for exercising fundamental 
freedoms, such as peacefully protesting against or criticizing government policies. Ms. 
Ebadi was the subject of three urgent appeals sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, successively on 8 December 2003, 13 January 2005 and 4 August 
2005. Mr.  Soltani, an Iranian lawyer and a founding member of DHRC, was the also the 
subject of  previous urgent appeals (see above).    
</p>
<p> 
187. According to the information received, on 3 August 2006, the Iranian Ministry of 
the Interior declared the activities of DHRC illegal, and that those who continued its 
activities would be prosecuted. Since its creation, DHRC has been repeatedly denied legal 
registration, its requests for registration having been systematically blocked by the Iranian 
authorities without any reasons being provided. On 16 July 2006, the Revolutionnary 
Court sentenced Mr. Soltani to five years of prison for disclosing confidential information 
and opposing the State. He appealed the Court&#8217;s ruling and is still awaiting the decision. 
Moreover, Ms. Ebadi was summoned in 2005 by the Revolutionary Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
office, without official reasons, and threatened with arrest and prosecution. Grave concerns 
are expressed that the ban of DHRC may form part of a sustained campaign of harassment 
and intimidation against members of DRHC for their legitmate human rights activities. 
Further concern is expressed at the wider effect that declaring the organization illegal may 
have for other human rights defenders in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p> 
188. On 16 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal 
together with the the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture concerning the alleged imprisonment of 
Ahmad Batebi, a student activist, during an approved period of leave from prison. Ahmad 
Batebi was originally detained in 1999 for his participation in a student demonstration 
following the closure of the newspaper <i>Salam</i>. He had been convicted on charges of 
&#8220;endangering national security&#8221; and sentenced to death by the Islamic Revolutionary 
Courts. The sentence was later commuted to 15 years of imprisonment. The situation of 
Ahmad Batebi has been subject of two communications sent to the Government on 6 
October 2000 by the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights on the 
situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and on 20 November 2003 by the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative on the 
situation of human rights defenders. Reportedly, due to his poor health and after serving six 
years of his sentence, Ahmad Batebi was granted approved leave by doctors appointed by 
the judiciary. According to the information received, on 27 July 2006, unknown armed 
persons conducted a search of his home, arrested Ahmad Batebi and drove him to an 
undisclosed location, believed to be Evin Prison in Teheran. He is reportedly being denied 
access to his family and lawyer. Serious concerns have been expressed that Mr. Batebi's </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>new arrest was motivated by his activities as a human rights defender and may form part of 
a campaign of intimidation and harassment against human rights defenders in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p> 
189. On 21 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders concerning the 
arrest and trial of Reza Abbasi, a member of the Association for the Defence of Azerbaijani 
Political Prisoners (ASMAK) and an activist for democracy and human rights through his 
involvement with the Alumni Association of Iran (Sazman-e Danesh Amukhtegan-e Iran-e 
Eslami&#232; [Advar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat]). Mr. Abbasi was the subject of a joint urgent appeal 
by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 4 May 2004. 
According to the information received, Mr. Abbasi was arrested on 27 June 2006 for 
refusing to present himself to a facility run by the Ministry of Information in accordance 
with a verbal summons.  He was reportedly taken to the Central Prison in Zenjan where he 
is allegedly detained on charges of &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221; and &#8220;insulting the 
Leader (of the Islamic Republic of Iran)&#8221;.  According to sources, the Ministry of 
Information has continued to persecute Mr. Abbasi&#8217;s family, including his elderly parents.  
On 5 September 2006, it is reported that Mr. Abbasi was presented before a closed session 
of Branch One of the Revolutionary Court in Zenjan, in the absence of his legal 
representative.  It is further reported that a second closed session of the court took place on 
11 September in the presence of his lawyer where he was asked about his involvement in 
ASMEK and student organizations.  A verdict is expected shortly. Concern is expressed 
that the arrest of Reza Abbasi is linked to his activities in defence of the human rights of 
Azeri Turks and, in particular, it is feared the arrest may be part of a campaign by security 
forces to prevent persons from the Azeri Turk community from attending the annual 
gathering at Babek Castle in honour of the ninth century figure Babek Khorramdin. Further 
concern is expressed for his physical and psychological integrity while in detention and 
that he may face an unfair trial.  
</p>
<p> 
190. On 13 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the  
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. In the urgent appeal, the expert referred to the fact that on 31 August 2006, the  
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions wrote to the 
Government, drawing attention to information he had received regarding the reported trial 
on charges carrying the death penalty of 22 Ahwazi Arab activists arrested by the 
Government in June 2006: Ali Motirijejad, Abdullh Solymani, Mlik Banitamimt, 
Abolamir Farjaolh Chaabi, Mohammad Chaabpour, Khalaf Khozairi, Alireza Asakereh,  
Majed Albog Hbaish, Ghasem Salamat, Abdolreza Sanawati, Said Hamydan, Ms. Fahimeh 
Esmaili Badawi, Toameh Chaab, Nasser Farajolah Kia, Majid Mazaal, Jalil Moghadam, 
Mehdi Saad Nasab, Ms. Hoda Hedayati Rezaie (Hawashemi), Sharif Asei Nawaseri, Jalil 
Boraihi, Mohammad Sawari and Abdolreza Salman Delfi. At the time, he expressed his 
concern about reports indicating that they were being tried in secret and that the competent </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 114 
</p>
<p>prosecutor-general had announced that he was seeking the death penalty for all the accused. 
That communication unfortunately remains unanswered by the Government. The experts 
subsequently received additional information according to which on 9 November 2006 the 
Head of the Judiciary in Khuzestan Province, Abbas Jaafari Dowlatabadi, announced that 
the Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence of 10 of the defendants mentioned 
above, namely Ali Motirijejad, Abdullh Solymani, Mlik Banitamimt, Abolamir Farjaolh 
Chaabi, Mohammad Chaabpour, Khalaf Khozairi, Alireza Asakereh,  Majed Albog Hbaish, 
Ghasem Salama and Abdolreza Sanawati. Iranian media have reportedly announced that 
the confessions of the 10 men will be broadcast on Khuzestan TV on 13 November 2006, 
and that their executions will be held in public, probably on 14 or 15 November 2006. The 
experts have received further information which corroborates their concerns expressed in 
the letter of 31 August 2006. Allegedly, all 10 men were tortured into making false 
confessions. Their lawyers were not allowed to see them prior to their trial and they were 
given access to the prosecution case only hours before the start of the trial. The trial was 
held in secret. The lawyers for the defendants, Khalil Saeedi, Mansur Atashneh, Dr. 
Abdulhasan Haidari, Jawad Tariri, Faisal Saeedi and Taheri Nasab, were arrested for 
having complained about violations of the relevant laws in the course of the trial and 
charged with threatening national security.    
</p>
<p> 
191. On 4 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal to the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding Mansour Ossanlu, Head of the Union of 
Workers of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, currently detained at Evin Prison. Mr. 
Ossanlu&#8217;s case was already the subject of an urgent appeal to the Government by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression on 16 January 2006. According to the information received, Mr. Ossanlu was 
arrested at his home by police on 22 December 2005 and eventually released on bail 
amounting to 1.5 billion rials on 9 August 2006. Mr. Ossanlu was awaiting trial on charges, 
the exact nature of which are not known, but which may include &#8220;propaganda against the 
the Islamic Republic&#8221; through leaflets and interviews with foreign anti-Government radio 
stations, and &#8220;acting to disturb internal State security by establishing links with hostile 
opposition groups and foreign countries&#8221;. Although he received a court summons to attend 
Branch 4 of the Special Court for Government Employees only on 20 November 2006, he 
had already been  rearrested the day before, outside his home, by plain-clothes members of 
the security forces and detained incommunicado at Evin Prison, section 209. His family 
has been able to visit him once, and his wife was also able to speak to him when she 
attended the court session on 20 November 2006. He is suffering from a serious eye 
complaint, but is not receiving medical treatment in prison. On 26 November 2006, Mr. 
Ossanlu appeared at Branch 14 of the Revolutionary Court for initial investigations by the 
prosecutor. No specific charges have been brought. Mr. Ossanlu&#8217;s lawyer could not attend 
the court session because Mr. Ossanlu did not have access to him. Concern is expressed 
that his rearrest and detention may be a further attempt to deter him from peacefully </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 115 
</p>
<p>exercising his legitimate right to freedom of association, including the right to form and 
join trade unions and the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and may also 
represent an attempt by the authorities to prevent him from carrying out his peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights, in particular labour rights.  Further concern is 
expressed as to his state of health and his physical integrity in view of the reported lack of 
proper medical treatment for his eye complaint and also in view of his incommunicado 
detention.   
</p>
<p> 
192. On 7 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding 
Saleh Kamrani, lawyer and member of the Central Association of Lawyers, resident in 
Karaj. Mr. Kamrani has already been the subject of a joint communication by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 10 July 2006 (see above), and by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 20 June 2006 (see above). 
According to the information received, on 31 October 2006, the Islamic Revolutionary 
Court of Tehran found Mr. Kamrani guilty of public activities against the system of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. The sentence is 
suspended for five years if he does not commit an offence during this period. Mr. Kamrani 
can file an appeal with the Appeal Court of Tehran Province. It is reported that Mr. 
Kamrani has been accused of assuming the legal representation of individuals who are in 
opposition to the system, and of individuals who are undermining national security by 
claiming their ethnic identity, such as Iranian Azeri Turks. In this context, the Special 
Rapportuer stresses that a lawyer cannot be identified with the cause of his clients and 
cannot be prosecuted for practising his legitimate activities as a legal representative of his 
clients. In addition, he recalls the concerns, as expressed in previous communications, in 
relation to the arrest and conduct of the trial of Mr. Kamrani. In particular, Mr Kamrani 
was apparently not arrested on charges brought against him, but abducted and detained for 
several days without access to his family or his lawyer. Mr. Kamrani&#8217;s lawyer was refused 
access to the files concerning the arrest and detention of his client, which delayed the 
preparation of his defence. In addition, it is reported that interrogations were conducted 
without the presence of Mr. Kamrani&#8217;s lawyer, and that the court proceedings were 
conducted in camera. In light of the foregoing, serious concerns are expressed that Mr. 
Kamrani&#8217;s trial was not conducted in accordance with international fair trial standards, and 
that the sentence against him is thus unfair and represents a reprisal for his activity as a 
lawyer defending Iranian Azeris Turks allegedly detained in connection with their political 
or cultural activities.

Press releases issued by the Special Rapporteur

193. On 10 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;IRAN MUST STOP EXECUTIONS OF AHWAZI ARABS SENTENCED TO 
DEATH FOLLOWING A SECRET, GROSSLY UNFAIR TRIAL, 
RAPPORTEURS SAY </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 116 
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;Philip Alston, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Leandro Despouy, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, and Manfred Nowak, the Special Rapporteur on torture, issued 
the following statement today. They are independent experts appointed by the 
United Nations Human Rights Council. 
 
&#8221;The UN Human Rights Council's experts on extrajudicial executions, 
independence of judges and lawyers and torture today urged the Iranian 
Government to &#8216;stop the imminent execution of seven men belonging to the 
Ahwazi Arab minority and grant them a fair and public hearing&#8217;. Philip Alston, 
Leandro Despouy and Manfred Nowak, the UN independent experts, called the 
attention of the international community to the case of ten men who were sentenced 
to death after a secret trial before a court in the Western Iranian province of 
Khuzestan. Their lawyers were not allowed to see the defendants prior to their trial, 
and were given access to the prosecution case only hours before the start of the trial. 
The lawyers were also intimidated by charges of &#8216;threatening national security&#8217; 
being brought against them. The convictions were reportedly based on confessions 
extorted under torture. &#8216;The only element of the cases of these men not shrouded in 
secrecy was the broadcast on public television of their so-called confessions&#8217;, Mr. 
Nowak said. The three experts indicated that in August and November 2006 they 
had sent two letters to the Government of Iran, bringing the allegations of unfair 
trial and torture to their attention and seeking clarification from the Government. 
No reply to these letters was ever received. Instead, three of the ten men were 
executed in mid-December with no regard for the strong concerns expressed on 
behalf of the UN Human Rights Council. On Monday, January 8th, 2007, the 
authorities in Ahwaz, the capital of Khuzestan province, informed the families of 
the remaining seven men that they would be executed within the next few days. 
&#8216;We are fully aware that these men are accused of serious crimes, including having 
tried to overthrow the Government after having received military training by US 
and UK forces&#8217;, the UN experts said. &#8216;However, this cannot justify their conviction 
and execution after trials that made a mockery of due process requirements.&#8217; 
 
&#8220;Background 
&#8221;The three men executed in mid-December (named Malek Banitamim, Abdullah 
Solymani and Ali Matorizadeh) and the seven reportedly at imminent risk of 
execution are part of a larger group of Ahwazi Arab activists arrested in June 2006 
on charges of having received training in Iraq by officials of the United States of 
America, the United Kingdom and Israel, and of having returned to Iran with the 
intent to destabilize the country, to sabotage oil installations and to overthrow the 
Government. In the course of the year 2006, the Special Rapporteur on summary 
executions has raised his concerns regarding unfair trials on capital charges also 
with regard to ten other Ahwazi Arabs, as well as other Iranians accused of 
violently opposing the Government. The Government of Iran systematically 
refuses to provide information and engage in a dialogue on these matters with the 
independent experts, violating its obligations under the procedures of the Human </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 117 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. Iran is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and has a legal obligation to respect its provisions. While the Covenant 
allows it to retain the death penalty, it prescribes that capital punishment can only 
be imposed after a trial satisfying the strictest fair trial guarantees. These include 
the right to a fair and public hearing, the right not to be compelled to confess guilt, 
and the right to &#8216;adequate time and facilities for the preparation of ones defence&#8217; 
with the assistance of a lawyer of ones own choosing. In their correspondence with 
the Government of Iran, the UN independent experts also expressed their concerns 
about the charges of &#8216;mohareb&#8217;, which according to the reports published in the 
Iranian media triggered the application of the death penalty in these cases. 
&#8216;Mohareb&#8217; can be translated as &#8216;being at war with God&#8217; and is a charge typically 
waged by the Iranian prosecutors against political dissidents, critics of the 
Government and persons accused of espionage. This charge carries with it the risk 
of being too vague to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set by international 
human rights law for the imposition and execution of the death penalty. The names 
of the seven men at imminent risk of execution are reported as Ghasem Salami, 
Mohammad Lazem Kaabpour, Abdolamir Farjolah Kaab, Alireza Asakereh, Majad 
Albughbish, Abdolreza Sanawati, and Khalaf Dohrab Khanafereh.&#8221;

Communications received 
</b></p>
<p> 
194. On 3 April 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 31 March 2006, indicating that Abdolfattah Soltani had been 
arrested on charges of disseminating classified intelligence and thus threatening State 
security. The Government added that he had been offered bail by the court and thus was 
free on bail.  
</p>
<p> 
195. On 19 July 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent on 20 June 
2006 and 10 July 2006 concerning Saleh Kamrani. The Government stated that according 
to information received from the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Kamrani 
had been detained and charged with &#8220;measures against internal security of the State&#8221; and 
referred to the relevant court. The court ruled that he could be released on bail but Mr, 
Kamrani could not afford to pay it and remained in custody.   
</p>
<p> 
196. On 8 September 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent on 11 
August 2006, indicating that the Defenders of Human Rights Centre had been registered 
and requested the necessary licence for its activities from the relevant authorities in Iran. 
According to the Government, its request has not yet been approved due to shortcomings in 
both the form and content of its statute. Except for preparing its statute, the Centre cannot 
undertake any activities before approval is obtained from the Ad Hoc Commission, a body 
composed of two representatives of the judiciary, two members of parliament and one 
representative of the Government, and which is empowered by article 10 of the &#8220;Bill on 
establishment and activities of parties and associations&#8221; to grant licences to establish 
parties.

</p>
<p><b> 
</b>197. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its cooperation and the information provided in response to his communications of 31 
March 2006, 20 June 2006, 10 July 2006 and 11 August 2006. However, he cannot but note 
with concern that in the course of 2006 no fewer than 13 communications had to be 
addressed to the Government. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the frequency and 
gravity of the allegations he has received throughout the year regarding situations in Iran 
and can only reiterate his serious concern about the generally deteriorating situation of 
lawyers working for the defence of human rights, and in particular for the defence of ethnic 
minorities in the country. He regrets that his communications of 1 March 2006, 31 March 
2006, 22 May 2006, 8 August 2006, 16 August 2006, 21 September 2006, 13 November 
2006, 4 December 2006 and 7 December 2006 have so far remained unanswered and urges 
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide at the earliest possible date, and 
preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, detailed 
substantive answers to the allegations relayed in these nine communications. 
</p>
<p> 
198. As regards the Government&#8217;s reply of 31 March 2006 concerning Abdolfattah 
Soltani, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the information provided by the Government 
but regrets that the Government only partially addressed the concerns of the Special 
Rapporteur. In particular, he would have appreciated receiving details about the basis upon 
which the General Prosecutor of Tehran decided to replace the investigating judge, 
resulting in Mr. Soltani&#8217;s remaining in custody for a further three months. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur would have liked the Government to provide information about the 
measures taken to ensure that Mr. Soltani was provided with adequate opportunities, time 
and facilities to be visited by and to communicate and consult with a lawyer, without delay, 
interception or censorship and in full confidentiality, as provided by principle 8 of the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. In addition, the Special Rapporteur would<b> </b>have<b> 
</b>appreciated information about measures that have been taken to redress the violation of Mr. 
Soltani&#8217;s right to presumption of innocence represented by the official letter from the 
judiciary rejecting his election as a member of the Board of theTehran Bar Association, on 
the grounds that his candidacy was not valid since he was in prison during the election. The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to provide at the earliest possible date a reply to 
all of these concerns, without which the Special Rapporteur would be compelled to 
conclude that Mr. Soltani was not given a fair trial. The Special Rapporteur was also 
concerned to learn from non-governmental sources that on 16 July 2006, Mr. Soltani was 
notified that the Revolutionary Court of Tehran had sentenced him to a five-year prison 
term and to the loss of his civic rights. The Special Rapporteur learned that Mr. Soltani 
appealed this decision, and would be grateful to the Government not only to provide 
information on the result of the appeal but also to take all the measures necessary to ensure 
Mr. Soltani&#8217;s right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by principle 23 of the Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>199. Concerning the case of Saleh Kamrani, the Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its reply of 19 July 2006, though he regrets that the answer was incomplete. 
The Special Rapporteur also notes that his communication of 7 December 2006 has 
remained unanswered. In this respect, he would request the Government to provide </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>information about the developments in this case and reiterates his call to the Government to 
take into account his concerns about the conduct of the trial and the grounds for Mr. 
Kamrani&#8217;s conviction when considering his appeal before the Appeal Court of Tehran 
Province. 
 
200. Regarding the reply of the Government to his joint urgent appeal of 11 August 
2006, the Special Rapporteur requests the Government to provide him with details on the 
&#8220;shortcomings in form and content&#8221; of the DHRC statute that prevent the Ad Hoc

Communications sent  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>201. On 16 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal<b> </b>regarding the 
trial of Saddam Hussein and his seven co-defendants which is scheduled to resume on 28 
February 2006. According to the information received, on 2 February, none of the eight 
defendants appeared in the courtroom, all of them choosing to boycott the proceedings and 
watch the trial from elsewhere in the building.  The non-appearance of the defendants was 
reportedly in response to the decision of Acting Chief Judge Raouf Abdul Rahman 
(appointed on 23 January) to remove from the courtroom one of the accused on 29 January, 
for de facto contempt of court as a result of a verbal outburst. In protest, all the privately 
hired defence counsel resigned, alleging that the acting Chief Judge was not impartial. 
They were immediately replaced by six court-appointed lawyers and the trial continued. 
The non-appearance of the accused in court is provided for under the Statute of the Iraqi 
Special Tribunal and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence, as is the appointment of duty 
counsel in the absence of representation. After a nine-day delay, the trial continued on 
13-14 February with the eight defendants back in the courtroom alongside their appointed 
counsel while their private defence team continued to boycott the proceedings. There is 
concern regarding the independence and impartiality of this trial, including reports that the 
the former Chief Judge, Rizgar Amin, had voluntarily resigned as a result of a number of 
factors, including public criticism from senior Iraqi government officials who questioned 
his handling of the trial. Further, it is reported that judicial independence has been 
compromised and thus the integrity of the trial is under serious threat, including allegations 
by the private defence team of bias on the part of Acting Chief Judge Rahman, who is from 
the Kurdish town of Halabja where the chemical gas attack took place in 1988 under the 
authority of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s forces.  
</p>
<p> 
202. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter<b> </b>regarding 
Dhia Al-Sady, member of the General Council and newly elected President of the Iraqi Bar 
Association; Mouzahim al-Jabouri, member of the General Council; and Sami al-Khitib, 
member of the General Council and Chairman of the Human Rights Committee of the Bar 
Association. According to the information received, on 16 November 2006, the General 
Council of the Iraqi Bar Association organized nationwide elections for a new president to 
replace the outgoing President, Kemal Hamdounand, and to elect the 10 members of the 
General Council. Dhia Al-Sady was elected as the new President with 1,615 votes, against </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 120 
</p>
<p>702 votes for Eswadal Menshawiwho. However, following the announcement of the 
results of the election, it is reported that the de-Baathification committee ruled that Dhia 
Al-Sady, Mouzahim al- Jabouri and Sami al-Khitib had been convicted and had no right to 
remain on the Bar Council. The committee&#8217;s ruling has been rejected as illegal by Dhia 
Al-Sady, Mouzahim al- Jabouri and Sami al-Khitib, as well as by Kemal Hamdounand, the 
outgoing President, Malik Douhan, former Minister of Justice, the Democratic Association 
of Iraqi Jurists and other civil society organizations in Iraq. Serious concerns are expressed 
that this ruling is an attempt to eliminate independent lawyers from higher positions of the 
Iraqi Bar Association and replace them with politically affiliated jurists, within the context 
of a broader attempt to eliminate independent lawyers and judges from the legal arena in 
Iraq, which severely affects the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in the 
country.

<b>Press releases 
</b> 
203. On 22 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;UN HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERT CONDEMNS ASSASSINATION OF IRAQI 
LAWYER 
 
&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mr. Leandro 
Despouy, today strongly condemns the assassination of a legal member of the 
defense team of Saddam Hussein and called on the Iraqi Government to launch an 
independent investigation into the killing.  
 
&#8220;The victim, Mr. Khamis al-Obeidi, was shot to death Wednesday after he was 
abducted from his Baghdad home. Mr. Despouy said he was particularly concerned 
at allegations that the police forces might have been involved. This is the third 
killing of a member of Saddam Hussein's defense team since the trial started in 
October last year. In this context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that the 
Iraqi High Tribunal has certain deficiencies and that its legitimacy has been 
rightfully criticized. He is concerned by the fact that its jurisdiction is limited since 
it cannot judge those responsible for war crimes committed by foreign armed forces 
neither during the first Gulf war (1990) not after 1 May 2003. Also, the Tribunal 
was set up in the context of an armed occupation which is mainly considered to be 
illegal. Moreover, it should be noted that the Tribunal violates a number of 
international human rights standards on the right to be tried by an independent and 
impartial tribunal and on the right to defense. In this regard, there have been 
numerous reports of external pressures on the judges of the Iraqi High Tribunal, 
which may have contributed to the removal and resignation of some of them. Also, 
the right to an appropriate and independent defense is undermined in particular by 
the extremely serious attacks against defense lawyers. Finally, he is concerned that 
the Tribunal is empowered to impose the death penalty and that the prosecution 
called for the death penalty for Saddam Hussein, his half-brother Barzan al-Tikriti 
and former senior regime member Taha Yassin Ramadan, in the context of 
proceedings where fair trial standards are not guaranteed. The Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 121 
</p>
<p>wishes to reiterate his support for the establishment of an international tribunal to 
ensure that the entire spectrum of barbaric crimes committed in Iraq are prosecuted 
in a comprehensive, independent and impartial manner, in full respect of the right 
to truth of all victims and of the international community at large. In this context, 
the prompt execution of Saddam Hussein would entail a loss of precious evidence. 
Both for Iraq and internationally, a sentence for Saddam Hussein reached at the end 
of proceedings that meet international human rights standards would have 
tremendous symbolic impact in the context of the fight against impunity and would 
exemplify that it is possible to impart justice which is not the verdict of the winners 
against the loosers. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that, in the current 
circumstances, the Iraqi High Tribunal hardly is in a position to achieve its stated 
objectives of justice.&#8221; 
 
</p>
<p>204. On 6 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;EXPERT ON JUDICIARY EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT SADDAM 
HUSSEIN TRIAL AND VERDICT AND CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TRIBUNAL  
 
&#8220;Leandro Despouy, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
issued the following statement today: 
 
&#8221;A day after the Iraqi High Tribunal ended its first trial of Saddam Hussein and 
sentenced him to death by hanging, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, reiterates his strong objections regarding 
the conduct of the trial and expresses his concern about the consequences this 
judgment may have over the situation in Iraq and in the region. The following are 
among the main objections of the Special Rapporteur: 
 &#183; The restricted personal jurisdiction of the tribunal, which enables it only to 
try Iraqis. 
 &#183; Its limited temporal jurisdiction. The competence of the tribunal does 
include neither the war crimes committed by foreign troops during the first Gulf 
war (1990), nor the war crimes committed after 1 May 2003, date of the beginning 
of the occupation.  
 &#183; Its doubtful legitimacy and credibility. The tribunal has been established 
during an occupation considered by many as illegal, is composed of judges who 
have been selected during this occupation, including non Iraqi citizens, and has 
been mainly financed by the United States. 
 &#183; The fact that the Statute of 10 December 2003 contains advanced 
provisions of international criminal law which are to be applied in combination 
with an outdated Iraqi legislation, which allows the death penalty. 
 &#183; The negative impact of the violence and the insecurity prevailing in the 
course of the trial and in the country. Since its beginning one of the judges, five 
candidate judges, three defense lawyers and an employee of the tribunal have been 
killed. Moreover, another employee of the tribunal has been seriously injured. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 122 
</p>
<p> &#183; Finally, and most importantly, the lack of observance of a legal framework 
that conforms to international human rights principles and standards, in particular 
the right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal which upholds the 
right to a defense.  
 
&#8220;The Special Rapporteur welcomes the determination of the Iraqi Government to 
sanction the main authors of the atrocities committed during three decades in the 
country and its will to see the trial take place in Iraq. At the same time, he deems it 
essential that this will be expressed through a trial conducted by an independent 
tribunal, legitimately established, acting in absolute transparency and providing all 
guarantees for a fair trial, in accordance with international human rights standards. 
If those conditions are not fulfilled, the verdict of the Iraqi High Tribunal, far from 
contributing to the institutional credibility of Iraq and the rule of law, risks being 
seen as the expression of the verdict of the winners over the losers. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Iraqi authorities not to carry out the death sentences imposed, 
as their application would represent a serious legal setback for the country and 
would be in open contradiction to the growing international tendency to abolish the 
death penalty, as demonstrated by the increasing number of ratifications of the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant of Civil and Political 
Rights. It is clear that the verdict and its possible application will contribute deepen 
the armed violence and the political and religious polarization in Iraq, bringing with 
it the almost certain risk that the crisis will spread to the entire region. The trial of 
Saddam Hussein has a particular significance not only for the thousands of victims 
in Iraq but also for its symbolism in the fight against impunity throughout the world. 
In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates its proposal for the establishment 
of an independent, impartial and international tribunal with all the necessary 
guarantees to enable it to receive the support of the United Nations, and which will 
take advantage of the rich experience acquired by other international tribunals. 
Since the present verdict is subject to appeal, it opens the possibility to consider the 
establishment of such an international tribunal which can guarantee a fair trial, 
either by reopening the present trial or by dealing with the appellate stage. This 
should be done with urgency, to attenuate the negative impact this verdict already 
started to produce in Iraq and the proliferation of violence in the region. Another 
reason for the establishment of such a tribunal is that the current trial is only a stage 
in a larger judicial process, since it only examines seven charges, which include 
genocide and crime against humanity, amongst the numerous ones attributed to 
Saddam Hussein and his close collaborators.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>205. On 28 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS INDEPENDENT EXPERT 
REITERATES CONCERNS ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN TRIAL AND 
DEATH SENTENCE  
&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mr. Leandro 
Despouy, issued the following statement today: 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 123 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the recent dismissal of the appeal by Mr. Saddam Hussein Al-Tikriti 
against the judgment and sentence of the Iraqi High Tribunal, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers deems it necessary to 
reiterate his concerns expressed earlier. The decision of the Appeals Chamber of 
the Iraqi High Tribunal apparently does not address the grave shortcomings of the 
trial, which involved several co-defendants. The Special Rapporteur's concerns 
were identified in his press statements of 22 June 2006 and of 6 November 2006. 
The shortcomings of the trial, as stated by the expert, are related to the lack of 
observance of international human rights standards and principles, in particular the 
right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal and the right to adequate 
defense, as stipulated inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Iraqi Government not to carry out the death sentence imposed upon Mr. 
Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants following what appears to have been a 
procedurally flawed legal process.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b> 
Communications received 
 
</b>206. On 26 April 2006, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 16 February 2006 regarding the trial of Saddam Hussein and his seven 
co-defendants. The Government of Iraq assured the Special Rapporteur that there are no 
grounds for concern as regards the independence of the court, inasmuch as the Iraqi 
judiciary is well known for its justice, impartiality and fearless readiness to speak the truth. 
The removal of one of the defendants from the courtroom for disruptive behaviour was a 
lawful measure under article 158 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (law No. 23 of 1971) 
and principle 52 (ii) of the schedule entitled &#8220;Principles of Procedure&#8221; appended to the 
Courts Act (law No. 10 of 2005).  There is no connection between this and the resignation 
of counsel for the defence, which was a voluntary decision on their part. Under Iraqi law, 
the court has the right to appoint counsel for the defendant in the absence of his own 
counsel (article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and article 30 of the schedule 
entitled &#8220;Principles of Procedure&#8221; appended to the Courts Act).  No complaints were made 
about the court-appointed counsel. The defence counsel who had left the courtroom 
returned voluntarily to exercise their lawful right to represent their clients. The 
independence of the court at the place where the hearing is being held is not open to 
question.  The Iraqi judiciary is fully independent. 
 
207. On 3 May 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 11 November 2005 together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders with regard to the incident 
involving victim Adel Mohammed Abbas and the injured Thamer Mahmud Hadi [illegible] 
al-Quza`i, living in the Green Zone. The Government reported that the two men were shot 
by unidentified men in the Adl district of Baghdad. The Government further indicates that 
the victim&#8217;s daughter, Ibtisam Adel Mohammed Abass al-Zubaydi, who was born in 1975 
and is a university professor, has said that she does not suspect anyone at present and has 
asked for her complaint to be brought against the culprits as soon as they are identified. 
Thamer Mahmud Abbas has made a statement on the incident, claiming that he was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 124 
</p>
<p>heading for his car when he was shot at by unidentified armed men. He was wounded, 
while his colleague, named above, was killed. The crime scene was examined but no 
evidence was found.  The victim&#8217;s body was sent to a pathologist for examination and the 
wounded man obtained a medical report. Investigators went to the crime scene to collect 
information about the incident, but this proved fruitless because the shop owners and local 
citizens refused to cooperate with the investigation. 
<b> 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p> 
208. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its cooperation and for the 
information it provided in its reply of 26 April 2006. The Special Rapporteur is, however, 
concerned at the absence of an official reply to his communication of 30 November 2006 
and urges the Government of Iraq to provide at the earliest possible date, and preferably 
before the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, a detailed substantive 
answer to the above allegations. 
 
209. With regard to the Iraqi High Tribunal, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned 
about the death sentences imposed upon Saddam Hussein and some of his co-defendants 
linked to his regime. He reiterates that international law allows the imposition of capital 
punishment only within rigorous legal constraints, including respect of fair trial standards, 
as he has mentioned on innumerous occasions. However, these standards are not 
guaranteed by the Iraqi High Tribunal. In light of the gravity of the shortcomings of the 
trial of Saddam Hussein and his co-defendants, the Special Rapporteur strongly calls upon 
the Iraqi authorities to suspend without delay any further executions until it is ensured that 
a fair trial is provided to those accused under its jurisdiction, in full respect of all due 
process guarantees required by international human rights law.

</b>210. On 19 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Ziyad Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan, human rights 
defender and fieldworker for Al-Haq, a Palestinian NGO and affiliate organization of the 
International Commission of Jurists which conducts research and advocacy work on 
human rights. Mr. Hmeidan has already been the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 14 March 2006, an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 29 November 2005, an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the </p>

</p>
<p>independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 1 July 2005 and an 
urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 7 
June 2005. The experts note the replies to their communications of 7 June 2005 and 1 July 
2005, but note that there has been no reply to the communications of 29 November 2005 or 
14 March 2006. According to the Government, administrative detention orders are limited 
to  six months and any extension requires re-evaluation of the relevant intelligence.   Mr 
Hmeidan has been in administrative detention since 23 May 2005 and continues to be held 
at Kedziot Prison. To date neither he nor his lawyer has been informed of the reasons for 
his arrest, despite the Government&#8217;s explanation that Mr. Hmeidan was &#8220;arrested on 
suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities.&#8221;  The Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders visited Mr. Hmeidan in 
prison during her official mission to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 
October 2005. 
</p>
<p> 
211. According to the new information received, on 10 May 2006 a military judge 
decided to uphold the third extension of Mr. Hmeidan&#8217;s administrative detention order, 
which is now said to expire on 12 July 2006. In previous communications to the 
Government the experts have expressed their grave concern regarding the arbitrary nature 
of the administrative detention of Mr. Hmeidan. In particular, they continue to be 
extremely concerned at the fact that he is being denied the exercise of his right to defence 
and to a fair trial, since he has been detained without any formal charges being brought 
against him since 23 May 2005. Furthermore his detention is reported to be based on secret 
evidence that has never been disclosed to either him or his lawyer, which undermines 
reliance on judicial review as a safeguard against arbitrary administrative detention. The 10 
May 2006 military order represents the third extension of his original administrative 
detention issued on 30 May 2005 which was originally for 18 days. It is reported that each 
extension of the detention orders is decided almost at the last minute, which causes severe 
anxiety and anguish to detainees and their families, amounting to psyschological torture. 
The experts are gravely concerned that Mr. Hmeidan&#8217;s detention may be subject to 
indefinite renewal, and reiterate thei concern that his detention is connected with his work 
in defence of human rights and represents an attempt by the Israeli authorities to interfere 
with his ability to conduct his legitimate activities in defence of human rights.   
</p>
<p> 
212. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together<b> </b>with<b> 
</b>the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning Ms. Kate Maynard, a British human rights lawyer who works with 
Hickman &amp; Rose , a London-based firm of solicitors. According to the information 
received, on 24 May 2006 Ms. Maynard was detained on arrival at Ben Gurion airport by 
Israeli security personnel, having travelled from the United Kingdom to speak at an 
international conference organized by Avocats Sans Fronti&#232;res in al Ram, near Jerusalem. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 126 
</p>
<p>It is reported that prior to her departure from Heathrow airport, she was questioned by 
Israeli officials. It is alleged that during her detention at Ben Gurion airport, Ms. Maynard 
was questioned about her involvement in collecting evidence against high-ranking Israeli 
military personnel and obtaining an arrest warrant for a senior Israeli military official in 
2005. It is further alleged that after she had been questioned, Ms. Maynard was denied 
entry into Israel and detained overnight pending deportation on 25 May 2006. Following 
these events, Ms. Maynard instructed an Israeli lawyer to apply to the Tel Aviv district 
court to prevent her deportation and obtain her release from custody. On 25 May 2006 the 
judge of the Tel Aviv district court ordered the authorities to lift the deportation order and 
directed that Ms. Maynard be admitted to the country for a limited period of time. It is 
reported that the Israeli immigration authorities declined to follow this ruling. It is further 
reported that Ms. Maynard left Israel in the morning of 26 May 2006, as she had already 
missed her allotted time to speak at the conference. Concern is expressed that the above 
events are connected with the activities of Kate Maynard in defence of human rights and 
may represent an attempt on the part of the authorities to prevent her from carrying out her 
legitimate work. 
</p>
<p> 
213. On 6 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Hassan Mustafa Hassan Zaga, a researcher who works 
with the NGOs the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) and Ansar 
Al-Sajeen (Prisoners Friends&#8217; Association). PCATI investigates complaints of torture or 
other ill-treatment and infringements of human rights by Israeli authorities and Ansar 
Al-Sajeen provides legal aid to Palestinian detainees and prisoners. Mr. Zaga was 
previously the subject of an urgent appeal sent jointly by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 20 January 2006. 
The experts regret that no reply to this communication has been received to date. 
According to the new information received, on 22 May 2006, the decision to extend Mr. 
Zaga's administrative detention order by four months was upheld by the Ketziot Military 
Court. The reason given by the General Security Service is that Hassan Mustafa Hassan 
Zaka &quot;endangers the security of the region&quot;; however, Mr. Zaga has not been given the 
opportunity to refute the charges brought against him and he is still being held in Ketziot 
Detention Centre. Concern is expressed that the decision to extend Mr. Zaga's 
administrative detention may be connected with his activities in defence of human rights. 
In the previous communication concern was expressed regarding the arbitrary nature of Mr. 
Zaga&#8217;s administrative detention. As his detention is reported to be based on evidence that 
was not disclosed to him, further concern is expressed that this undermines reliance on 
judicial review as a safeguard against arbitrary administrative detention.  
</p>
<p> 
214. On 17 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning the closing down of the offices of Ansar Al-Sajeen in Israel and the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 127 
</p>
<p>West Bank and the search of the house of Munir Mansour, its Chairperson. Ansar 
Al-Sajeen is registered under Israeli law, and is one of the largest providers of legal 
representation to Palestinian detainees before Israeli military courts. It pays legal visits to 
Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israel and advocates for their rights. It also works with 
prisoners&#8217; families in need and has facilitated Palestinian family visits. According to the 
information received, on 8 September 2006, in the early morning, the offices of Ansar 
Al-Sajeen in Tirah, Majd El-Kurum and throughout the West Bank were raided and closed 
down by the police and the Shin Bet following the issuance by the Israeli Defence Minister 
of an administrative order, in accordance with article 84-2B of the Defence (Emergency) 
Regulations (1945), declaring Ansar Al-Sajeen illegal. The police reportedly confiscated 
the organization&#8217;s assets, including 14,000 shekels earmarked for prisoners and their 
families, hundreds of legal files and documents, telephones, photocopying machines and 
computers. It is reported that the closure occurred soon after the association launched a 
campaign to include the cases of 1,948 Palestinian prisoners, citizens of Israel, in the 
current talks on the exchange of prisoners. Mr. Mansour&#8217;s house was searched on the same 
day by the same officials. Mr. Mansour was reportedly questioned for 1 &#189; hours and his 
mobile telephone was confiscated. Concerns are expressed that the closing down of the 
offices of Ansar Al-Sajeen in Israel and in the West Bank as well as the search of the house 
of its Chairperson may be in retaliation for the legitimate activities of the organization in 
defence of the rights of Palestinian prisoners detained in Israel. 
</p>
<p> 
215. On 25 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders concerning the detention of Ahmad Abu Haniya, a Palestinian 
human rights activist and Youth Project Coordinator with the Alternative Information 
Centre, a joint Palestinian-Israeli organization based in Jerusalem which promotes human 
rights and advocates social change in the region. According to the information received, on 
22 May 2005 Mr. Haniya was arrested at an Israeli military checkpoint on his way to work.  
He was subsequently detained under an administrative detention order and has been 
accused of membership of the Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine  and also 
membership of a group called Al-Islamia.  He is reported to be detained at Ketziot 
Detention Centre in the Negev. The administrative detention order against him has been 
renewed twice since he was first detained. Under the terms of an administrative detention 
order, the authorities are neither required to file charges against the detainee nor to bring 
the case to trial.  The order is usually for a determined period of time but is often renewed 
before it expires and it can be renewed indefinitely.  Neither the defendant nor his legal 
representative is entitled to view the &quot;classified&quot; evidence against the defendant. The 
current order is due to expire on 15 November 2006 but it is feared that it may be renewed. 
Concern is expressed that Ahmad Abu Haniya may be detained in order to prevent him 
from carrying out peaceful activities in defence of human rights.  
</p>
<p> 
216. On 1 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning Ziyad Muhammad Shehadeh Hmeidan. Mr. Hmeidan has already </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>been the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 19 May 2006 (see above), an urgent appeal sent by 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 14 March 2006, an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 29 November 2005, an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the

Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 7 
June 2005. The experts note the replies to the communications of 7 June 2005, 1 July 2005 
and 29 November 2005 but regret that there has been no reply to the communications of 14 
March 2006 and 19 May 2006.   
</p>
<p> 
217. According to the new information received, on 14 November 2006, Mr. Hmeidan 
was informed that a new administrative detention order would be issued which would 
extend his current detention for a further four months. The new order reportedly came into 
effect on 19 November 2006, the date scheduled for his release, and is now due to expire on 
18 March 2007.   It is also reported that a review hearing was held on 20 November 2006 at 
which the administrative detention order was upheld on the basis of the same &#8220;secret 
evidence&#8221; which was used to detain him in May 2005 &#8220;on suspicion of involvement in 
terrorist activities&#8221;. In previous communications the experts have expressed grave concern 
regarding the arbitrary nature of Mr. Hmeidan&#8217;s administrative detention. In particular, 
they continue to be extremely concerned at the fact that he is being denied the exercise of 
his right to defence and to a fair trial, since he has been detained without any formal 
charges being brought against him since 23 May 2005. Furthermore, his detention is 
reported to be based on secret evidence that has never been disclosed to either him or his 
lawyer, which undermines reliance on judicial review as a safeguard against arbitrary 
administrative detention. The 19 November 2006 military order represents the fourth 
extension of his original administrative detention issued on 30 May 2005, which was 
originally for 18 days. It is reported that each extension of the detention order is issued 
almost at the last minute, which causes severe anxiety and anguish to detainees and their 
families, amounting to psychological torture. The experts are gravely concerned that Mr 
Hmeidan&#8217;s order may be subject to indefinite renewal. They reiterate their concerns that 
his detention is connected with his work in defence of human rights and represents an 
attempt by the Israeli authorities to interfere with his ability to conduct his legitimate </p>

requesting information on the actions taken to follow up on the recommendations listed in 
the report of his mission to Kazakhstan (E/CN.4/2005/60/Add.2), as well as other more 
general information on the progress made in the country in matters pertaining to his 
mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> 
Communications received 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>221. By letter of 31 January 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur 
about the results of an international seminar held in November 2005 organized by the 
Supreme Court, together with the Human Rights Commission attached to the Office of the 
President of Kazakhstan, the United Nations Development Programme and the Embassy of 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Kazakhstan, with the 
participation of representatives of the administration of the President of Kazakhstan, the 
Parliament, the Constitutional Council, the Office of the Procurator-General, the Bar, 
NGOs, embassies and international organizations. While the participants in the seminar 
noted the importance and timeliness of the questions raised by the Special Rapporteur in 
his report, they did not support the view that &#8220;the judiciary &#8230; remains &#8230; highly dependent 
upon &#8230; the executive&#8221;. It was pointed out that Kazakhstan&#8217;s judiciary has now acquired 
real powers and operates on an equal footing with the legislative and executive branches of 
Government. The establishment in September 2000 of the Judicial Administration 
Committee of the Supreme Court as the body authorized to provide organizational and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 130 
</p>
<p>logistical support for the work of the courts has made possible the complete exclusion of 
the executive&#8217;s influence on the judicial system. As regards the procedure for electing and 
appointing judges, the participants in the seminar maintained that it was completely 
democratic and transparent since the appointment of judges by presidential decree 
constitutes the very last stage in the selection procedure and is the culmination of public 
participation in the appointment of judges. The participants also pointed to disciplinary and 
qualification boards and judicial ethics commissions which consider the liability of judges 
for violations committed in the administration of justice and complaints against judges 
who commit violations of ethical behaviour, respectively. Furthermore, Kazakhstan is 
taking steps to solve a number of problems involving the further harmonization of the 
judicial system with international principles and standards. This process has been 
facilitated by Kazakhstan&#8217;s ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights on 21 November 2005, and of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights on 28 November 2005. Moreover, an important element in the process of 
reforming the judicial system is the introduction of criminal proceedings with the 
participation of jurors. One of the strategic objectives in the organization of the judicial 
system is to improve personnel management. A draft law on the creation of a panel to 
determine a judge&#8217;s professional suitability to administer justice was proposed. 
Furthermore, the draft law sets out, inter alia,  the grounds for suspending or terminating a 
judge&#8217;s power, which will improve the quality of the administration of justice in line with 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations (para. 80). With respect to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation on the creation of an effective system of education and 
professional training of judicial personnel (para. 74), reference was made to the 
establishment of the Justice Institute of the State Administration Academy attached to the 
Office of the President. In addition, Kazakhstan was making efforts to improve ethical 
standards, openness, access to courts and the transparency of judicial procedures in line 
with the recommendations contained in the report (paras. 86-88). While not denying 
individual occurrences of negative phenomena among judges, the participants in the 
seminar could not agree with the assertion that the entire judicial system is corrupt. In order 
to combat corruption, organizational and functional measures are being taken to eliminate 
the causes of corruption such as the automated system of assigning cases to judges and 
complete audio recordings of legal proceedings. Preparations are also being made to 
introduce a system of specialized juvenile courts in line with paragraph 89 of the 
recommendations. As regards the Bar, a bill on strengthening the role of lawyers in legal 
proceedings is being prepared, which would also broaden lawyer&#8217;s procedural powers, 
including their access to factual information necessary for providing legal assistance (para. 
81). Finally, with the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights the power to authorize detention has been transferred to the courts.          
</p>
<p> 
222. On 17 January 2007, the Government of Kazakhstan provided further information 
on the actions taken to follow up on the recommendations listed in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mission report to Kazakhstan. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its cooperation.  Unfortunately, this reply could not be translated in time

<p>223. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its cooperation and for its 
replies of 31 January 2006 and 17 January 2007 on the follow-up to his mission report. 
Concerning the reply of 31 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction 
that Kazakhstan is taking steps to further harmonize the judicial system with international 
principles and standards. He particularly welcomes the introduction of criminal 
proceedings with the participation of jurors, and the proposed establishment of the Justice 
Institute of the State Administration Academy attached to the Office of the President. He 
also welcomes the two draft laws on the status of judges and on strengthening the role of 
lawyers in legal proceedings that are being prepared. He hopes to receive further 
information on the status of these draft laws, on the introduction of the jurors system in 
criminal proceedings and the proposed establishment of the Justice Institute of the State 
Administration Academy, and on the implementation of the other recommendations 
included in his report.

225. On 20 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding Zhakhongir Maksudov, Odilzhon 
Rakhimov, Yakub Toshboev and Rasulzhon Pirmatov. They were the subject of an urgent 
appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 30 December 
2005 and of urgent appeals sent on 23 June 2005 and on 26 January 2006 by the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture. These cases are furthermore pending before the 
Human Rights Committee, which has requested the Government to take interim measures 
of protection, i.e. not to proceed with the extradition of the men to Uzbekistan as long as 
the communications are pending. According to additional information received, the four 
men&#8217;s appeals against the extradition decisions were rejected by the Supreme Court of 
Kyrgyzstan in April and May 2006 for Zhakhongir Maksudov, Odilzhon Rakhimov, 
Yakub Toshboev, and on 13 June 2006 for Rasulzhon Pirmatov. It is reported that on 19 
June 2006, the authorities said that they would extradite them, but a date has not yet been 
set.   The four men are still in detention. Concern is expressed that these persons may be at 
risk of torture or ill-treatment if they are forcibly returned to Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p> 
226. On 23 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, concerning Ms. R.G.D, an 
82-year-old woman living in Ananievo, Issyk-Kul.  According to the information received, 
during the night of 22 April 2005, Ms. D. was raped in her home by a man she was able to 
identify as Salamat Avasovich Akmataliev. The alleged perpetrator ordered her to cover </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 132 
</p>
<p>her eyes with a blanket and demanded to know whether she recognized him. She denied 
knowing him, and promised not to report him to the police, fearing for her life. The next 
morning, Ms. D. reported the incident to the police. She underwent a physical examination, 
which confirmed that she had been raped. Ms. D. then went to the oblast prosecutor&#8217;s 
office, where she was informed by the prosecutor that Mr. Akmataliev was under 
investigation and that he had provided a written undertaking not to leave the area.  He 
claimed that the case would be sent to court once the investigation was completed.  Later, 
however, the assistant prosecutor in Cholpon-Aty Mairambek informed Ms. D. that her 
case had been transferred to the oblast authorities. To date, there has been no trial regarding 
this matter. Reportedly, Mr. Akmataliev was interrogated by three investigators, but bribed 
them in order to terminate the investigation.  Sources allege that Mr. Akmataliev publicly 
boasted that he has enough money to guarantee his impunity. According to the information 
received, this rape case is not an isolated incident; impunity for rape and other forms of 
sexual violence is said recently to have intensified.  The experts expressed particular 
concern about the increasingly widespread practice of &#8220;bride kidnapping&#8221;, whereby a 
woman or girl is taken against her will, through deception or force, and made to marry one 
of her abductors.  Sources allege that the abductors are often intoxicated and act in groups, 
using physical or psychological coercion to compel the woman to &#8220;agree&#8221; to the marriage. 
These marriages are reportedly rarely registered with the State. It is further alleged that 
kidnapped women are often raped by the abductors, but fail to report the crime for fear of 
repercussions. The abductions occur in all parts of Kyrgyzstan, both urban and rural.  The 
women involved are typically under the age of 25. Some victims are also minors. Despite 
the fact that article 155 of the Criminal Code outlaws non-consensual marriage, it is 
reported that the perpetrators of such kidnappings are rarely prosecuted and enjoy impunity 
for their crime.  The police are often said to fail to even investigate reported cases of bride 
kidnapping, as many police officers do not view this as a law enforcement issue, but 
consider it to be a legitimate traditional practice.

<p> 
227. On 27 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government 
requesting information on the actions taken to follow up on the recommendations listed in 
the report of his mission to Kyrgyzstan (E/CN.4/2006/52/Add.3), as well as other more 
general information on the progress made in the country in matters pertaining to his 
mandate.

<p> 
228. On 16 February 2006, the Government replied to the the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter  
of 13 December 2005, regarding the advance unedited copy of the draft report concerning 
the visit of the Special Rapporteur to Kyrgyzstan in September 2005. The Government was 
to reply with any possible alternations by 2 January 2006. The Government commented on 
the conclusions and recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur. First, the 
Government disagreed with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s concern that the Kyrgyz Republic is 
unable to fulfil its role to effectively protect citizens&#8217; rights and that there is increasing 
distrust among the population of the judicial system. The Government offered statistics 
indicating that the number of cases tried by the Kyrgyz courts is up by almost 23 per cent, 
due mainly to the increase in the number of civil and economic disputes. With respect to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 133 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s concern relating to corruption among judges, the Government 
advised that a mechanism for bringing disciplinary proceedings against members of the 
judiciary was established in 2003. Furthermore, the Congress of Judges of the Kyrgyz 
Republic adopted a Judicial Code of Conduct in 1996. With regard to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s call to abolish the death penalty and to extend the moratorium on executions 
pending the abolition, the Government indicated that a presidential decree extended the 
moratorium on the execution of the death penalty as of 1 January 2006. Furthermore, 
pursuant to this decree the Government was given two months to prepare and submit to the 
President bills on the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, and on 
the abolition of the death penalty and its commutation to life imprisonment or a lengthy 
term of imprisonment. As regards access to a lawyer, the Government pointed to article 85, 
paragraph 12, of the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic. The Government agreed with the 
recommendation on repealing the requirement that a lawyer must obtain permission from 
the investigator before gaining access to his or her client. As to the use of metal cages, the 
Government indicated that their removal is being envisaged once public security has 
stabilized and people have developed better legal awareness. The Government completely 
agreed with the recommendation that, where there is insufficient evidence to convict, 
defendants should be acquitted. Judicial practice in the last three years indicated that the 
courts have handed down acquittals in a significant number of cases. The numbers of 
acquittals increased by 22 per cent on average during this period. With regard to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s call to introduce alternatives to the deprivation of liberty, the 
Government advised that a draft law in that regard is being prepared. The principal 
innovation is the introduction of new types of penalties unconnected with deprivation of 
liberty, such as restriction of liberty and punitive deduction of earnings. The Government 
agreed to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s call that the right of the prosecutor to initiate 
supervisory reviews should be abolished. As to the establishment of a system of juvenile 
justice as a matter of priority, the Government indicated that on 14 August 2001 the State 
Programme for the Realization of Children&#8217;s Rights, &#8220;New Generation&#8221;, was adopted, one 
component of which is the introduction of a juvenile justice system. Regarding the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation that candidates for judicial positions in the highest courts 
should have prior solid judicial experience, the Government reported that the Supreme 
Court proposed an amendment to the Constitution requiring prospective appointees to the 
Court to have 10 years of legal experience, of which at least five years must have been 
spent working in the courts. With respect to the call of the Special Rapporteur to strengthen 
the Bar, the Government advised that a policy framework for the reform, which had been 
developed with direct input from practising legal experts, was ratified by the Government 
Decision of 21 April 2005. The policy framework is a set of viewpoints on the present state 
of the legal profession and its future development. In June 2005, the Kyrgyz Parliament 
adopted the bill on legal practitioners and the Kyrgyz Bar at its first reading.

230. On 12 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
concerning the rapes of two girls aged 9 and 12. According to information received, on 27 
February 2006, a 9-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 19-year-old man in Lofa County. 
When the family reported the matter to the authorities, the Circuit Sheriff Court allegedly 
tried to extort a bribe of 350 Liberian dollars from the victim&#8217;s father to arrest the alleged 
perpetrator. It is furthermore alleged that the magistrate of Voinjama also demanded a 
payment of 300 Liberian dollars to issue an arrest warrant. The judge reportedly claimed 
that the money was needed to cover the cost of transporting the alleged perpetrator to jail.  
On 7 March 2006, after the victim&#8217;s father had paid 100 Liberian dollars to the magistrate, 
the alleged perpetrator was arrested and sent to pre-trial detention. The next day, the prison 
authorities released the man pursuant to a written order by the magistrate to the prison 
authorities stating that the man &#8220;is under bond in court with two sureties&quot;. Since then the 
authorities have reportedly not taken any further steps in the matter. In March and April 
2005, Joseph Katakao, a 48-year-old pastor of the Living Word Pentecostal Church 
allegedly raped A.K., a 12-year-old girl from Todee District, Montserrado County, on three 
separate occasions. Joseph Katakoa allegedly threatened the victim with death if she told 
her mother. A.K. only told her mother that she had been raped when the mother discovered 
that she was pregnant. When the mother confronted Joseph Katakoa, he allegedly gave her 
250 Liberian dollars for an abortion.  The family reported this to the Careysburg Police 
Detachment. However, the police initially decided that there was no need to arrest Joseph 
Katakoa or initiate criminal proceedings against him since he had taken steps to settle the 
issue amicably with the victim&#8217;s family. Following an intervention by the United Nations 
Mission in Liberia Joseph Katakoa was arrested, taken to the Careysburg Magistrates&#8217; 
Court and later transferred to the City Court in Monrovia. On 16 May 2005, a pre-trial 
conference was held in the chambers of the Stipendiary Magistrate of the City Court, where 
the defendant&#8217;s counsel attempted to settle the case by offering a promissory note signed 
by Joseph Katakoa to the victim&#8217;s family. The document contained a pledge to provide 
support to the victim during her pregnancy and take financial responsibility for the care of 
the child. The family refused the settlement offer and requested the Assistant County 
Attorney to proceed with the prosecution of the case. The case was forwarded to the 1st 
Judicial Circuit Court Criminal Court &#8220;A&#8221; for trial.  Reportedly, the grand jury hearing the 
case later attempted to exhort 1,500 Liberian dollars to allow the victim to testify. When 
the family refused to pay the bribe, the grand jury refused to hear the case.

233. On 23 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with<b> 
</b>the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, concerning Malik Imtiaz Sarwar, one of two lawyers currently representing Ms 
Lina Joy in the Federal Court of Malaysia. Ms. Joy is reported to be a Malay woman who 
has renounced her Muslim faith and embraced Christianity, and the court proceedings are 
concerned with whether she can renounce Islam and has the right to have the religious 
affliation on her identity card deleted. According to the information received, Malik Imtiaz 
has received death threats from an unknown group which openly calls for his death because 
of his role in this case. Mr. Sarwar is portrayed on posters and on the Internet as a betrayer 
of Islam and a monetary reward is offered to anyone who will kill him. Concern is 
expressed that such threats are linked to the lawful professional activity of Imtiaz Sarwar as 
a lawyer and may represent an attempt to intimidate lawyers who take on cases in defence 
of the right to freedom of religion and belief.

Hern&#225;ndez y Gast&#243;n de la Luz Albino, integrantes ambos de la CDHL, se habr&#237;an 
percatado de que, en distintos momentos desde mediados del mes de febrero de 2006, un 
grupo de hombres j&#243;venes, con aspecto de pertenecer a cuerpos de seguridad, les hab&#237;an 
seguido, vigilado y fotografiado. Se teme que estas amenazas puedan estar relacionadas 
con el trabajo que lleva a cabo el Sr. Mart&#237;n Barrios Hern&#225;ndez en defensa de los derechos 
humanos de los ind&#237;genas y de los obreros maquiladores en Tehuacan y la Sierra de Puebla. 
Adem&#225;s, se teme que estas amenazas formen parte de una campa&#241;a de hostigamiento 
contra los miembros de la CDHL. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida se habr&#237;an 
solicitado medidas cautelares a la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH) 
y a la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos del Estado de Puebla para la protecci&#243;n del Sr. 
Mart&#237;n Barrios Hern&#225;ndez.

<p>239. El 6 de marzo del 2006, el Relator especial, junto con la Representante Especial del 
Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, la 
Relatora Especial sobre las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias y la Relatora 
Especial sobre la violencia contra la mujer, sus causas y consecuencias, envi&#243; una carta de 
alegaci&#243;n sobre el abogado y defensor de derechos humanos Dante Almaraz.  De acuerdo a 
dicha informaci&#243;n, el 26 de enero de 2006 Dante Almaraz fue asesinado con un arma de 
fuego por hombres no identificados, mientras conduc&#237;a en el centro de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez 
(Estado de Chihuahua). En efecto, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en dicha fecha el 
veh&#237;culo del Sr. Almaraz  fue interceptado por otro veh&#237;culo tripulado por varios hombres 
no identificados, quienes le dispararon en repetidas ocasiones. Durante dicho ataque 
result&#243; herido uno de sus acompa&#241;antes. La CIDH ya hab&#237;a ordenado al Estado de M&#233;xico 
tomar todas las medidas necesarias para proteger la integridad de Dante Almaraz. Dante 
Almaraz era un reconocido abogado defensor de derechos humanos de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. 
Antes de su muerte hab&#237;a defendido a V&#237;ctor Javier Garc&#237;a Uribe, quien al parecer habr&#237;a 
sido torturado con el fin de que confesara la autor&#237;a del homicidio de ocho mujeres en 2001. 
El Sr. Garc&#237;a Uribe fue condenado a 50 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n. Asimismo, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n 
recibida, la familia de Dante Almaraz habr&#237;a recibido varias amenazas an&#243;nimas de muerte, 
con el fin de que &#233;ste no continuara con la defensa del Sr. Garc&#237;a Uribe. Este &#250;ltimo fue 
liberado como resultado de un recurso de apelaci&#243;n. Por otra parte, otro abogado que 
particip&#243; en la defensa de los acusados del caso de los ocho homicidios en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, 
Mario Escobedo Anaya,  habr&#237;a resultado muerto en una persecuci&#243;n llevada a cabo por la 
polic&#237;a en febrero de 2002. Su defendido, el Sr. Gustavo Gonz&#225;lez Meza, muri&#243; en prisi&#243;n 
en el a&#241;o 2003.   
</p>
<p> 
240. El 10 de mayo del 2006, el Relator Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre la 
promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y la Representante Especial 
del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n los defensores de los derechos humanos, envi&#243; un 
llamamiento urgente, en relaci&#243;n con el se&#241;or Dami&#225;n Gustavo Camacho Guzm&#225;n, 
abogado y Coordinador Jur&#237;dico de la Comisi&#243;n Independiente de Derechos Humanos de 
Morelo. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 4 de mayo de 2006 el se&#241;or Dami&#225;n 
Gustavo Camacho Guzm&#225;n habr&#237;a sido detenido por miembros de la Polic&#237;a Federal 
Preventiva frente a un hotel ubicado en las inmediaciones de San Salvador Atenco. El Sr. 
Dami&#225;n Gustavo Camacho Guzm&#225;n estaba actuando en calidad de observador de las 
violaciones de los derechos humanos que en ese momento estaban ocurriendo y como 
abogado defensor comisionado por la Comisi&#243;n Independiente de Derechos Humanos de 
Morelo para monitorear las violaciones de derechos humanos que se habr&#237;an cometido en 
contra del pueblo de San Salvador Atenco desde el d&#237;a 3 de mayo de 2006 en el mercado de 
flores de Texcoco, respondiendo al llamado de los vendedores de flores de San Salvador 
Atenco quienes habr&#237;an sido detenidos. Al momento de ser detenido el Sr. Dami&#225;n Gustavo 
Camacho Guzm&#225;n estaba brindando informaci&#243;n relativa a las detenciones a periodistas. 
De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, la polic&#237;a lo habr&#237;a arrestado sin presentar una 
orden de aprehensi&#243;n y sin que se le encontrara en flagrancia cometiendo alg&#250;n il&#237;cito.  Se 
teme que la detenci&#243;n del Sr. Dami&#225;n Gustavo Camacho Guzm&#225;n es arbitraria y pueda ser 
relacionado con su trabajo en defensa de derechos humanos, en particular por su defensa de 
los vendedores de flores en San Salvador Atenco.

<p>241. El 18 de Julio del 2006, el Relator Especial, junto con el Relator Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y la 
Relatora Especial sobre la violencia contra la mujer, sus causas y consecuencias, envi&#243; un 
llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con Socorro Melo de Jes&#250;s, estudiante ind&#237;gena de 20 
a&#241;os, quien vive en el Estado de Guerrero. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 6 de abril del 
2005, en su camino hacia la escuela, Socorro Melo de Jes&#250;s fue violada por un agente de 
polic&#237;a, quien le puso una pistola en la espalda y la oblig&#243; a tener relaciones sexuales. La 
estudiante pudo observar a su captor, quien portaba un uniforme de polic&#237;a. Despu&#233;s de la 
violaci&#243;n, su captor la amenaz&#243; dici&#233;ndole que ser&#237;a in&#250;til que denunciara los hechos ante 
las autoridades puesto que &#233;l trabajaba en la polic&#237;a y no recibir&#237;a ninguna sanci&#243;n. Los 
familiares de Socorro Melo de Jes&#250;s denunciaron los hechos ante el Ministerio p&#250;blico 
investigador. El mismo d&#237;a fue detenido Aurelio Gregorio Azuares, un polic&#237;a preventivo 
del Municipio de Tlapa de Comonfort, quien fue reconocido por la v&#237;ctima sin temor a 
equivocarse como responsable del delito de violaci&#243;n. El 7 de abril de 2005, Aurelio 
Gregorio Azuares fue puesto a disposici&#243;n del Juzgado de Primera Instancia en materia 
Penal de la ciudad de Tlapa, bajo el cargo judicial de violaci&#243;n, en el expediente penal 
58/2005-III. Sin embargo, hasta el d&#237;a de hoy el Juez no ha dictado sentencia. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, durante el proceso judicial el Juez no ha actuado de manera 
imparcial. Por una parte, se alega que &#233;ste tuvo una conducta hostigante hacia Socorro 
Melo de Jes&#250;s, puesto que la oblig&#243; en tres ocasiones a enfrentarse a su agresor, haciendo 
preguntas sobre su vida privada, y poniendo varias veces en duda sus alegaciones, a pesar 
de que ella hab&#237;a manifestado su total certidumbre frente a los hechos. Por otra parte, el 
Juez habr&#237;a recurrido a m&#233;todos de dilaci&#243;n. As&#237;, se habr&#237;a negado a resolver el caso 
aduciendo que a&#250;n faltaban pruebas por practicar, a pesar de que ninguna de las dos partes 
ha solicitado mayores medios probatorios. Asimismo, el Juzgador de oficio habr&#237;a  pedido 
recientemente la pr&#225;ctica de una prueba de muestras de semen del inculpado: sin embargo, 
esta prueba no tendr&#225; ninguna utilidad, puesto que a pesar de que hace m&#225;s de un a&#241;o en el 
cuerpo de Socorro se detect&#243; semen de su violador, ya ha pasado demasiado tiempo para 
que se pueda determinar el ADN de dichas muestras.

242. El 27 de Julio del 2006<b>,</b> el Relator Especial, junto con el Relator Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, envi&#243; 
un llamamiento urgente recibido en relaci&#243;n con Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol, un ind&#237;gena del 
pueblo Amuzgo, presidente del Comisariado de Bienes Ejidales de Xochistlahuaca (Estado 
de Guerrero). Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 2 de mayo de 2004, la Asamblea Ejidal 
del Comisariado de Bienes Ejidales de Xochistlahuaca, cuyo presidente es el Se&#241;or Genaro 
Cruz Apostol, encarcel&#243; durante 12 horas a Narciso Garc&#237;a, quien se hab&#237;a apropiado de 
forma ilegal de m&#225;s de 12 hect&#225;reas de tierras de uso com&#250;n pertenecientes al ejido. Antes 
de ser citado a la Asamblea, el Presidente del Comisariado de Bienes Ejidales, Genaro 
Cruz Ap&#243;stol, cit&#243; al Sr. Narciso Garc&#237;a  con el fin de hablar con &#233;l y hacerle consciente del 
da&#241;o que estaba ocasionando a la comunidad. Sin embargo, &#233;ste no habr&#237;a acudido, motivo 
por el cual fue citado para presentarse ante la Asamblea General de Ejidatarios el d&#237;a 2 de 
mayo del 2004. En dicha reuni&#243;n la Asamblea hizo &#233;nfasis en que las tierras eran de uso 
com&#250;n, y que por su mismo car&#225;cter no podr&#237;an ser destinadas al uso o posesi&#243;n de ning&#250;n 
particular, puesto que estaban destinadas a un beneficio colectivo. Sin embargo, el Sr. 
Narciso Garc&#237;a habr&#237;a insistido en desconocer las razones de la acusaci&#243;n, as&#237; como las </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 140 
</p>
<p>autoridades e instituciones que le demandaban devolver las tierras de las cuales se hab&#237;a 
adue&#241;ado ileg&#237;timamente. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Sr. Garc&#237;a respondi&#243; de 
manera muy agresiva y abandon&#243; el lugar de la Asamblea, la cual a pesar de este hecho 
continu&#243; con la discusi&#243;n y decidi&#243; imponer al Sr. Garc&#237;a una sanci&#243;n correctiva 
consistente en una detenci&#243;n por 12 horas. Se afirma que durante la detenci&#243;n al Sr. Garc&#237;a 
le fue permitido comunicarse con su familia y fue alimentado adecuadamente. Despu&#233;s de 
su liberaci&#243;n, Narciso Garc&#237;a present&#243; una denuncia penal ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico del 
fuero com&#250;n, en el municipio de Ometepec (Guerrero), en contra de Genaro Cruz por 
privaci&#243;n de libertad. El 14 de julio de 2004, el Sr. Genaro Cruz fue detenido por polic&#237;as 
judiciales del Estado y trasladado al Penal de Ometepec, saliendo posteriormente bajo 
libertad condicional. Desde entonces el Sr. Cruz ha estado bajo investigaci&#243;n penal en el 
Juzgado Penal de Primera Instancia del Distrito Judicial de Abasolo. El Juzgado es 
presidido por el juez Aurelio Guti&#233;rrez Cruz, a quien le corresponder&#225; dictar sentencia en el 
mes de agosto del 2006; el n&#250;mero de la acusaci&#243;n penal es: 110/2004.

</b>243. El 21 de diciembre del 2006, el Relator Especial, junto con la Representante 
Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos 
humanos, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con la Sra. Y&#233;sica Sanchez Maya,

noviembre de 2006. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 7 de diciembre de 2006, 
las Sras. Y&#233;sica Sanchez Maya y Aline Castellanos Jurado habr&#237;an recibido una orden de 
aprehensi&#243;n del juzgado primero penal de primera instancia del distrito judicial de Etla, 
Oaxaca.  Supuestamente las dos activistas fueron acusadas del delito de despojo agravado 
contra la Corporaci&#243;n Oaxaque&#241;a de Radio y Televisi&#243;n, Canal 9, en hechos ocurridos el 1 
de agosto de 2006. Seg&#250;n los informes, la LIMEDDH ha presentado varios informes y 
acciones urgentes sobre graves violaciones de derechos humanos llevadas a cabo durante 
la represi&#243;n de las protestas sociales que han tenido lugar desde mayo de 2006 en Oaxaca. 
Tambi&#233;n, el 27 de octubre de 2006, la Sra. Y&#233;sica Sanchez Maya denunci&#243; estas mismas 
violaciones ante de la CIDH en Washington, durante una audiencia requerida por la 
LIMEDDH. Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n sobre la orden de aprehensi&#243;n en contra de las Sras. 
Y&#233;sica Sanchez Maya y Aline Castellanos Jurado que puede representar un intento de 
disuadir a todos los miembros de LIMEDDH de continuar con su trabajo en defensa de los 
derechos humanos, y en particular de su labor en su calidad de observadores, supervisando 
y documentando las violaciones de los derechos humanos.

</p>
<p>&quot;1. El 12 de febrero del presente de 2006, aproximadamente a las 14:30 hrs., el 
suscrito Gast&#243;n de la Luz Albino, en compa&#241;&#237;a de Rodrigo Santiago Hern&#225;ndez y 
Mart&#237;n Barrios Hern&#225;ndez, integrantes todos de la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos 
y Laborales del Valle de Tehuacan, participarnos en un foro pol&#237;tico cultural 
celebrado en la Casa de Cultura de Altepexi, Puebla. Al t&#233;rmino del encuentro, una 
persona desconocida de sexo masculino, alto, de tez blanca, se acerc&#243; a nosotros y 
nos dijo: 
&quot;Cu&#237;dense y cuiden a Mart&#237;n porque ya est&#225; contratada una persona que va sobre su 
cabeza .... La cabeza de Mart&#237;n ya tiene precio&quot;. 
2. Dicho individuo nos dijo que la persona que ha sido contratada para atentar 
contra nuestras vidas es un hombre alto de complexi&#243;n delgada y que quiz&#225;s puede 
estar relacionada con algunos empresarios del ramo textil radicados en Ajalpan y 
Tehuacan, sin que a mi me conste la plena veracidad de dicha informaci&#243;n.&quot; 
</p>
<p> 
247. Se dio inicio a la constancia de hechos 1008/2006/7&#176;, de la S&#233;ptima Agencia del

distintos momentos desde mediados del mes de febrero de 2006, un grupo de hombres 
j&#243;venes con aspecto de pertenecer a cuerpos de seguridad le hayan seguido, vigilando y 
fotografiando. Las investigaciones no han concluido, por ser necesario establecer en 
primer lugar, la identidad de la persona desconocida a la que Gast&#243;n de la Luz Albino 
refiere haber visto el 12 de febrero de 2006, aproximadamente a las 14.30 horas, en la Casa 
de Cultura de Altepexi, independientemente de que a la luz de las alegaciones trascritas en 
la persona buscada como cercana a la familia Barrios, hecho que se har&#225; de inmediato

siguiente informaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con el llamamiento urgente del 2 de marzo de 2006 sobre 
el caso de la Sra. Erica Serrano Far&#237;as.  El Gobierno de M&#233;xico inform&#243; de que no est&#225; en 
posibilidad de determinar sobre su exactitud y veracidad, toda vez que el Gobierno de 
Veracruz manifest&#243; que despu&#233;s de que sus autoridades ministeriales realizaran una 
b&#250;squeda exhaustiva en los libros de gobierno de la Agencia del Ministerio P&#250;blico de Jos&#233; 
Azueta (Estado de Veracruz), no se hall&#243; registro alguno de investigaci&#243;n ministerial o

Indic&#243; que son parcialmente ciertos los hechos expuestos en la comunicaci&#243;n, por las 
siguientes consideraciones. Con base en una decisi&#243;n de la Asamblea General de 
Ejidatarios, el se&#241;or Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol, en su car&#225;cter de presidente del Comisariado </p>

<p>Ejidal de Xochistlahuaca, Guerrero, aplic&#243; una sanci&#243;n correctiva en contra de Narciso 
Garc&#237;a Valtierra, con motivo de haberse apropiado ilegalmente de 12 hect&#225;reas de tierras 
de uso com&#250;n perteneciente al ejido. La sanci&#243;n impuesta a Narciso Garc&#237;a Valtierra 
consisti&#243; en su detenci&#243;n por un lapso de 12 horas. Con motivo de esos hechos, la se&#241;ora 
Gloria de Jes&#250;s Valtierra present&#243; una denuncia ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico de Ometepec, 
Guerrero, compareciendo posteriormente a ratificarla el se&#241;or Narciso Garc&#237;a Valtierra. A 
fin de esclarecer los hechos, el Ministerio P&#250;blico practic&#243; diversas diligencias, entre las 
que se destacan las declaraciones de los testigos pres&#233;nciales de los hechos, el dictamen en 
materia de criminal&#237;stica de campo y fotograf&#237;a forense, el reconocimiento m&#233;dico del 
se&#241;or Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol por parte del m&#233;dico legista, la inspecci&#243;n ocular practicada en 
el lugar en donde estuvo privado de su libertad, as&#237; como el informe de investigaci&#243;n de la 
Polic&#237;a Ministerial, actuaciones y diligencias ministeriales que fueron aptas y 
responsabilidad penal del se&#241;or Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol. El 18 de junio de 2004 el Ministerio 
P&#250;blico ejercit&#243; acci&#243;n penal en su contra, solicitando al juez penal girara la orden de 
aprehensi&#243;n por su probable responsabilidad por el delito de privaci&#243;n legal de la libertad. 
El 14 de julio de 2004, fue cumplimentada la orden de aprehensi&#243;n poni&#233;ndolo a 
disposici&#243;n del Juez de Primera Instancia del ramo penal del Distrito Judicial de Abasolo 
(Guerrero), quedando interno en el Centro de Readaptaci&#243;n Social de Ometepec (Guerrero). 
El 15 de julio de 2004, rindi&#243; su declaraci&#243;n preparatoria y posterior a ello, su defensor 
particular solicit&#243; la duplicidad del t&#233;rmino constitucional y tramit&#243; su libertad provisional 
bajo cauci&#243;n, pues el delito por el cual se le atribuye su probable responsabilidad, no es 
considerado como grave. El 16 de julio de 2004, el juez penal le otorg&#243; el beneficio de la 
libertad bajo fianza. En la ampliaci&#243;n del t&#233;rmino constitucional, el se&#241;or Genaro Cruz 
Ap&#243;stol y su defensor particular ofrecieron los interrogatorios del agraviado, de la 
denunciante y de los testigos de cargo, as&#237; como la ampliaci&#243;n de su declaraci&#243;n 
preparatoria y las testimoniales de descargo. Una vez desahogadas las pruebas ofrecidas 
por el se&#241;or Cruz Ap&#243;stol, el juez penal dict&#243; el 20 de julio de 2004, auto de formal prisi&#243;n, 
pues consider&#243; que as pruebas ofrecidas no era suficientes para desvirtuar la probable 
responsabilidad del delito de privaci&#243;n ilegal de la libertad personal. El 1.&#186; de septiembre 
de 2004, se desahogaron diligencias de careos entre la denunciante, agraviado y los testigos 
de descargo, as&#237; como testimoniales de descargo a favor del procesado y se agreg&#243; al 
expediente el dictamen en materia de antropolog&#237;a social solicitando por la defensa del 
procesado. El 6 de septiembre de 2005, se llev&#243; a cabo la diligencia de interrogatorio que le 
formul&#243; el defensor particular al procesado Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol, as&#237; como a la 
denunciante y a los testigos de descargo. El 24 de mayo de 2006, el defensor particular del 
se&#241;or Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol solicit&#243; al juez penal el cierre de la instrucci&#243;n, no obstante que 
a&#250;n se encontraban pruebas pendientes por desahogar. Una vez recibida la solicitud y 
despu&#233;s de hacer un an&#225;lisis de las probanzas contendidas en la causa penal, el juez penal 
advirti&#243; la existencia de pruebas pendientes por desahogar, lo que dejaba en estado de 
indefensi&#243;n al procesado, considerando procedente no consentir el cierre de la instrucci&#243;n. 
Actualmente el proceso penal se encuentra en per&#237;odo de instrucci&#243;n o pruebas.  
 
255. El 10 de agosto de 2004,  la Comisi&#243;n de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos del 
Estado de Guerrero recibi&#243; una queja presentada por la Red de Defensores Comunitarios 
por los Derechos Humanos, mediante la cual se&#241;alaron presuntas violaciones a los 
derechos humanos del se&#241;or Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol, por parte de elementos de la Polic&#237;a </p>

<p>Ministerial del Estado de Guerrero, del Delegado del Gobierno de Guerrero y por el Juez 
penal de primera instancia. Dicha instituci&#243;n solicit&#243; a las autoridades se&#241;aladas como 
responsables, que rindieran el informe correspondiente, notific&#225;ndoles la apertura del 
per&#237;odo probatorio. Las autoridades se&#241;aladas como responsables rindieron el informe 
solicitado y ofrecieron las pruebas que estimaron pertinentes. El se&#241;or Genaro Cruz 
Ap&#243;stol ratific&#243; en todas y cada de sus partes el escrito de queja y ofreci&#243; la declaraci&#243;n de 
testigos. A efecto de allegar mayores al expediente de queja, representantes de la 
CDDH-GRO solicitaron un informe complementario al Coordinador Regional de la 
Polic&#237;a Ministerial del Estado, quien present&#243; el informe solicitado y anex&#243; diversas 
documentales como prueba. Una vez reunidas las probanzas, el 18 de octubre de 2004 la 
CDDH-GRO emiti&#243; una opini&#243;n dirigida al Procurador General de Justicia del Estado de 
Guerrero, pues consider&#243; que al ejecutar la orden de aprehensi&#243;n los elementos de la 
polic&#237;a ministerial, contravinieron las disposiciones legales al allanar el domicilio del se&#241;or 
Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol. No se inici&#243; ninguna investigaci&#243;n ya que en ese caso el se&#241;or 
Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol es se&#241;alado como probable responsable del delito de privaci&#243;n ilegal 
de la libertad personal en agravio de Narciso Garc&#237;a Valtierra. Como se observa, la 
decisi&#243;n del se&#241;or Genaro Cruz Ap&#243;stol consistente en aplicar una sanci&#243;n correctiva en 
contra de Narciso Garc&#237;a Valtierra fue contrario a las normas establecidas en el derecho

procuraci&#243;n y administraci&#243;n de la justicia.

aprecia que el mismo haya tenido a bien enviarle en un plazo razonable informaciones

para que estos hechos cesen de ocurrir y los operadores juridicos puedan trabajar en un 
ambiente que garantice su seguridad as&#237; como el respeto de los derechos de sus clientes.

</b>257. On 10 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food<b> </b>and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment regarding Vitalii Kolibaba, previously held 
at the remand centre (IVS) in Chisinau central police station and currently held at the 
remand centre (IVS) at 6 Tighina Street in Chisinau. According to the information 
received, Vitalii Kolibaba was arrested at his home early on 21 April 2006 and taken to 
Buiucani disctrict police station. On 25 April 2006, at Buiucani police station, three police 
officers tied his arms to his legs, stuck a crowbar under his elbows and hung him in this </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 147 
</p>
<p>position from the crowbar for 40 minutes, beating him onthe head and neck with a stool 
while he was suspended until he passed out.  This was allegedly done to force him to 
confess to having injured a policeman, which he denies. After he was taken back to his cell, 
Vitalii Kolibaba tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrists. An ambulance was called 
and his wounds were stitched, but the medics left him in the police station. On 27 April 
Vitalii Kolibaba was allowed to see a lawyer for the first time since his arrest. He told the 
lawyer that he had been tortured, following which the lawyer filed a complaint with the 
prosecutor's office. When the police officers from Buiucani district police station who had 
tortured him found out that he had complained, they beat him again. This time the three 
police officers beat him on the head with a plastic bottle full of water, so as to leave no 
marks, and punched him in the kidneys. His lawyer is allowed to meet him only in the 
presence of the procurator or the police officers. On 29 April 2006, Vitalii Kolibaba was 
taken for a forensic medical examination. The examination was superficial and the three 
officers who had tortured him were present. The forensic expert reported that there was no 
evidence of torture. Vitalii Kolibaba was taken to Buiucani district police station every day 
for questioning. There are no facilities for providing food at Buiucani district police 
station, which means that he is forced to beg food from other prisoners. In the remand 
centre where he is currently held prisoners are provided with hot water and bread, but this 
food is said to be inedible. The utensils are filthy and the bread is of very poor quality. All 
prisoners rely on packages brought by relatives. As he is not allowed to receive packages 
from his mother he does not have access to adequate and sufficient food.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>258. On 19 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> </b>the 
Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights defenders 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Ana Ursachi and Roman Zadoinov, lawyers. According to the 
information received, Ms. Ursachi and Mr. Zadoinov are, respectively, the lawyers of Mr 
Kolibaba and Mr. Gurgurov, two persons who allege having been tortured by the police 
during detention and who were the subject of communications sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 10 May 2006 (see above), and 
by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 23 November 2005. The two lawyers have 
worked closely with human rights organizations on torture cases. On 26 June 2006, the 
Procurator-General wrote to the National Bar Association accusing Ms Ursachi and Mr 
Zadoinov of misuse of position, which means that they could face a maximum prison 
sentence of five years or a fine. He referred to the urgent appeals issued in cases of Mr. 
Kolibaba and Mr. Gurgurov and claimed that there was no evidence of torture in either 
case. He blamed the irresponsible and unfounded oppositional behaviour of the lawyers 
and asked the Bar Association to ensure that there was no further damage to the interests of 
the State. On 28 June 2006, both lawyers were informed that they faced criminal 
prosecution for spreading false information about human rights violations in Moldova. Ms. 
Ursachi&#8217;s client was released after an urgent appeal launched by an NGO. However, the 
publicity embarrassed the Procurator-General, who, in a letter to the NGO on 9 March 
2006, stated that the version of events given in the urgent appeal did not correspond to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 148 
</p>
<p>reality, and gave a bad image of the State. No action was taken against the alleged 
perpetrators of torture. Mr. Zadoinov&#8217;s client was also released on bail after an urgent 
appeal. At the end of May 2006, the Procurator-General&#8217;s Office reported that no criminal 
case would be brought against the police officers accused of torture. Concerns are 
expressed that the letter to the Bar Association of Moldova is a deliberate attempt to 
intimidate Ana Ursachi and Roman Zadoinov and to prevent them and other lawyers in 
Moldova from carrying out their lawful professional activities for the protection of human 
rights, and in particular against grave human rights violations such as torture. 
</p>
<p><b> 
Communications received  
</b> 
259. On 5 July 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent on 10 May 
2006. The Office of the Procurator-General considered the communication relating to 
reports carried in the international press concerning the case of Vitalii Kolibaba and the 
vigorous steps taken by representatives of Amnesty International to defend and restore his 
allegedly infringed rights. Particular emphasis is placed on the fact that from 21 April to 27 
July 2006 Mr. Kolibaba was subjected to beatings, torture and inhuman treatment by 
officers of the Buiucani district police station. Following careful examination of the 
applications submitted by Mr. Kolibaba&#8217;s lawyer in accordance with article 274 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, the procurators of the Buiucani district procurator&#8217;s office 
concluded that the arguments put forward were irrelevant, and declined to initiate criminal 
proceedings on the grounds that no offence had been committed by the police officers. The 
facts as established by the procurators are as follows. Mr. Kolibaba came to the attention of 
the authorities in 2002, when he was registered as an opium user. On 18 April 2006, at 
around 2.30 a.m., while being pursued by the police for having committed an offence, Mr. 
Kolibaba, acting out of contempt for law enforcement officials and endeavouring to escape 
arrest, unexpectedly struck police officer Dmitrii Bobeico with a sharp object on his face 
and neck causing him moderate bodily harm.  Mr. Kolibaba thereupon disappeared from 
the scene of the incident, without providing any medical assistance or calling an 
ambulance. On the basis of this evidence, on 26 April 2006, criminal proceedings were 
initiated against Mr. Kolibaba under article 350, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code for an 
attempt on the life of a police officer. On 21 April 2006, Mr. Kolibaba had been arrested for 
an administrative offence committed prior to the criminal offence mentioned above and 
appeared before a judge, who sentenced him to five days&#8217; administrative detention. 
Subsequently, during the criminal proceedings against him, Mr. Kolibaba was held in 
preventive detention and was released on bail on 15 May 2006. It should be noted that 
when Mr. Kolibaba was examined by doctors in the emergency department at the hospital, 
and subsequently by the court medical expert, no internal or external injuries were found 
apart from a cut on his right forearm, which he had himself inflicted with a piece of metal 
while he was being held in custody in order to mislead the procurator and avoid criminal 
prosecution. The Buiucani district procurator&#8217;s office submitted a report to the chief of 
police concerning the breach of conduct by the officers responsible, who had allowed Mr. 
Kolibaba to obtain a piece of metal while he was being held in custody. In view of the 
foregoing, the Office of the Procurator-General considers that the circumstances and 
manner in which the injuries were sustained were correctly established by the procurators 
in the Buiucani district procurator&#8217;s office, in Chisinau.  No evidence was found of the use </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 149 
</p>
<p>of torture or ill-treatment against Mr. Kolibaba. According to the Government of the 
Republic of Moldova, the position taken by the lawyer is clearly untenable: his appeal to 
the international organizations to take up Mr. Kolibaba&#8217;s case is quite unwarranted and he 
is surrounding the issue with a mass of misinformation in the hope of winning his case. 
<b> 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations</b> 
 
260. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Moldova for its reply to his 
communication of 10 May 2006. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
Government&#8217;s cooperation and its detailed information in response to the allegation, he 
wishes to obtain more information related to the investigation led by the procurators of 
Buiuciani into Mr. Kolibaba&#8217;s complaint that he had been subjected to torture by police 
officers. 
<b> 
</b>261. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply to his 
communication of 19 July 2006 and urges the Government of Modlova to provide 
substantive detailed information at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end 
of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council.

265. On 22 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar regarding the 
situation of Thein Zan, a lawyer assisting the family in a case related to the death of Win 
Lwin at a stone quarry at Yathe, a.k.a. Kyauksarit Mountain, and of Ko Zaw Htay and 
Aung Than Htun, two other persons also assisting the victim&#8217;s family in this case. 
According to information received, on 8 December 2004, Win Lwin was killed while 
working at the stone quarry at Kyauksarit Mountain. It would appear that the Ngapying 
village authorities ordered the work, in spite of a legal prohibition (Order 1/99 and the 
Supplementary Order). In February 2005, Win Lwin&#8217;s brothers and sister lodged a 
complaint of forced labour before the delegation of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) and the Ministry of Labour. It is reported that on 4 and 6 April 2005, officials from 
the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of General Administration and the 
Magwe Division of the Peace and Development Council went to Ngapying village in an 
attempt to bribe members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) 
as well as other villagers to deny that they had been instructed to carry out forced labour. 
Moreover, it is alleged that on 6 April 2005, township-level authorities headed by Myint </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 151 
</p>
<p>Maung tried to pressure and threaten Win Lwin&#8217;s brothers, Ko Min Lwin and Ko Aung 
Win. It is alleged that Ko Min Lwin was forced to sign a statement saying that he had 
wrongly reported the case to the ILO. It is alleged too that on 24 April, two staff members 
of the Ministry of Labour took to Yangon some members of Win Lwin&#8217;s family - Ko Aung 
Win, Ko Min Lwin, Thein Thein and a nephew named Hpoe Kyaw - who were kept in a 
room under police surveillance until 29 April 29. During this time they were reportedly 
threatened by different persons who wanted to obtain the names of the people who helped 
them lodge the complaint with the ILO. The Deputy Minister of Labour, Win Sein, also 
allegedly visited the group, offering various incentives to drop the charges. In the 
meantime, it appears that the Magwe Division Peace and Development Council instructed 
the Thayet District Peace and Development Council to prosecute Thein Zan, Ko Zaw Htay 
and Aung Than Htun for having damaged the national reputation. On 14 October 2005, 
they were summoned by Aung Lan township court judge Khin Khin Swe and charged on 
20 October under section 182 of the Criminal Code for knowingly giving false information 
to a public servant, which carries a six-month jail term. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>266. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar regarding Aye Myint, 
a lawyer. Aye Myint, who was previously sentenced to death for &#8220;high treason&#8221; on the 
grounds of alleged contacts with the ILO, was released from custody in January 2005, and 
rearrested in August 2005 and charged under section 5 (e) of the 1950 Emergency 
Provisions Act, for &quot;spreading false information&quot;. The grounds for the charge appear to be 
a letter concerning a land confiscation case which he had sent to the authorities on behalf of 
his clients, a copy of which he had forwarded to the ILO. On 31 October 2005 Aye Myint 
was convicted by the Daik-U township court for having disseminated &quot;false information&quot;, 
and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. It has been reported that the case was 
summarily dismissed by the Bago District Court on 2 January 2006 (where Judge Khin 
Win Myint presided), and again subsequently by the Bago Divisional Court on 2 March 
2006 (where Assistant Divisional Judge Khin Saw Nyunt presided). It is understood that 
the lawyers representing Aye Myint are preparing to lodge an appeal at the Supreme Court. 
Concern is expressed that the charges against Aye Myint may represent an attempt to 
prevent him from carrying out his work in defence of his client&#8217;s human rights. 
Furthermore, there is serious concern that Aye Myint to date has not been afforded a fair 
trial and may not receive a fair hearing at the Supreme Court. The reasons for this concern 
are threefold. Firstly, the two key witnesses, farmers Kanya and Kyaing (prosecution 
witnesses Nos. 6 and 7), have maintained that they, and not Aye Myint, initiated a letter of 
complaint dated 6 June 2005 to the ILO regarding insufficient allocation of pastureland 
(132.5  out of an existing 452.6 acres) for their cattle at a meeting called by the Daik-U 
Township Peace and Development Council in Phaungdawthi village on 5 June, chaired by 
the township secretary, Aye Ngwe. They have also insisted that their complaint is genuine. 
It is alleged that there are no grounds for assuming that Aye Myint is guilty of spreading 
false information, as no evidence has emerged that the information is false as argued by the 
authorities. Secondly, there is concern that the court may have punished Aye Myint for 
having had contact with the ILO. However, the Supreme Court has earlier held that as 
Myanmar is a State Member of the United Nations and the ILO, it cannot be illegal for its 
citizens to have contact with these agencies (Supreme Court judgements in Special Appeal </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 152 
</p>
<p>Nos. 22 and 23 of 2004: <i>Zaw Myo Htet (a.k.a.) Zaw Zaw and three others</i> v. <i>Union of</i> 
<i>Myanmar</i>; <i>Naing Yeitkha (a.k.a.) Ne Win and eight others</i> v. <i>Union of Myanmar</i>, 14 
October 2004). Thirdly, in 1989 the Government issued an order that the Emergency 
Provisions Act could only be exercised with the approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs 
(State Law and Order Restoration Council, document No. 021/1 1/NaWaTa, 11 May 1989). 
However, in this case no permission has apparently been given. The case has been lodged 
through the local authorities, with a police officer as complainant. Therefore, the case is 
alleged to be procedurally incorrect and the conviction illegal.  
 
267. On 18 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar regarding Myint 
Aye, leader of the Human Rights Defenders and Promoters group and former Chairperson 
of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in Kyeemyintdaing township. According to 
the information received, on 30 September 2006, at approximately 10.15 a.m., Myint Aye 
was taken from his home by two policemen, Aung Kyaw Oo from the Special Branch and 
Lt. Aung Aung Myint from the West Yangon division. Myint Aye was told that he was 
being taken for discussions with the authorities; however, he has not had contact with his 
family or his legal representative since and his current whereabouts are unknown. On 29 
September Myint Aye and 10 others had released a statement, in the name of the Human 
Rights Defenders and Promoters, calling for the release of three former student leaders of 
the 88 Generation Student Group who had allegedly been detained without charge on 27 
September 2006. It is further reported that Myint Aye has been detained on four previous 
occasions in relation to his work. Concern is expressed that the alleged detention of Myint 
Aye may represent an attempt by the authorities to prevent him from carrying out his 
legitimate activities in defence of human rights, and particularly his work in reporting 
human rights violations in Myanmar. 
 
268. On 23 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter<b> </b>concerning a 
series of court ruling which raise serious concerns regarding the lack of independence of 
the judiciary in Myanmar. According to the information received, on 29 March 2006, Tin 
Nyein, a farmer of Kyun village tract, was jailed for complaining that on 19 August 2005, 
six workers assigned by the township authorities to land and water works in Kwunthi 
Chaung village demolished embankments that he had constructed in a stream on his land, 
thereby destroying over 100 acres of crops. The authorities allegedly denied his allegations 
and on 6 December 2005, one of the workers, San Myint, lodged a counter-complaint in the 
township court arguing that Tin Nyein had made false claims against him and his 
colleagues in order to injure their reputations. Tin Nyein then lodged a petition with the 
Pyapon District Court against the legal action of San Myint, but it was rejected without a 
hearing on 23 December. On 14 February 2006, he lodged an appeal with the divisional 
court that the case against him was illegal for procedural reasons. It has been reported that 
the court agreed but did not dismiss the case completely; Instead, it instructed that charges 
be brought under suitable provisions of the law. As a result, in March 2006, Police 
Superintendent Tin Htun of Bogolay township police station lodged a new complaint 
against Tin Nyein for attempting to cause a breach of the peace and upset public </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 153 
</p>
<p>tranquillity. On 29 March, Judge Bhyein Aung ruled that Tin Nyein was guilty of both 
charges and sentenced him to two years in jail. The latter lodged an appeal with the Pyapon 
District Court but it was rejected on 29 May 2006. The case will now be prepared to go to 
the Ayeyawaddy Divisional Court. The Special Rapporteur also drew the Government&#8217;s 
attention to the case of Ma Su Su New, a villager who had won a case in early 2005 against 
local government officials concerning their use of forced labour on a road construction 
project. However, in October 2005, the new local authorities accused Ma Su Su New of 
criminal intimidation and lodged charges against her. During the trial, the judge was 
allegedly replaced with another judge who reportedly did not even listen to the arguments 
of the defence lawyer. She was found guilty and the court rejected her successive appeals. 
She has been sentenced to 18 months in jail and was immediately transported to Insein 
Prison, where she has been kept in special quarters. Other similar cases have been reported. 
On 20 and 21 September 2005, Ma Aye Aye Aung, a betel nut seller, was reportedly 
surrounded and beaten up in public together with her husband by a group led by the local 
Council Chairman in Mandalay Division. The couple lodged a complaint before the 
township criminal court but they had to go to the court more than 25 times before the case 
was heard. Furthermore, the medical reports of their injuries were reportedly given to the 
police and not to the couple, and the doctor who examined Aye Aye Aung and her husband 
was not heard by the court, in violation of article 14 3 (e) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. On 27 December the court found that the Council Chairman was 
not guilty. The accused were ordered to pay 5,000 kyats each for verbal abuse. Reportedly, 
they could have been charged with offences that carry up to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
Furthermore, Ma San San Aye and Ma Aye Mi San were allegedly raped in 2004 by a local 
government official in Pyapon township. At least one of the two was a minor at the time. 
The victims were convicted of defamation and sentenced to four years&#8217; imprisonment after 
attempting to bring the case to court. This case was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent 
by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar in 21 April 2004. Finally, Aye 
Win and Win Nyunt were allegedly sentenced to two years in prison on 2 December 2005, 
after complaining to the township authorities that their village council was extorting 
money. The village council undertook legal action at the Bogolay Criminal Court against 
the complainants for making false allegations. Several witnesses testified that the original 
complaint of the farmers was genuine. On 2 December, Judge Bhyein Aung found the two 
men guilty and sentenced them to the maximum term of two years at hard labour. Concern 
is expressed that such rulings might reflect a trend of the judiciary to side with State 
officials in virtually all cases where a private citizen stands against a State agent, thus 
undermining the possibility of obtaining redress for human rights violations.

269. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with<b> </b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
regarding Ko Win Ko, 38 years of age, a member of the NLD, currently detained at 
Paungte Prison, and Phyoe Zaw Latt (a.k.a. Ko Wa Toat), 23 years of age, currently </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 154 
</p>
<p>detained at Tharawaddy Prison, both residents of Yethabhyar village, Hteindaw village 
tract, Minhla District, Moenyo township, Bago Division. According to the allegations 
received, both men were stopped by about 10 members of the Letpadan township police 
and of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) at Letpadan train 
station on 6 October 2006 at around 10 a.m. While searching the men, the officials found 
signature sheets bearing more than 400 signatures in support of a petition calling for the 
release of Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary of the NLD, and of detained student 
activists including Paw Oo Tun (a.k.a. Min Ko Naing), Ko Ko Gyi, Htay Kywe, Min Zeya 
and Pyone Cho. The latter were already the subject of a joint urgent appeal by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in Myanmar on 6 October 2006, which has unfortunately 
remained without a reply from the Government of Myanmar. Following the search, Than 
Myat Soe and Than Zaw Win, both USDA members from Letpadan township, produced 
evidence that they claimed to have found in Ko Win Ko's bag. The two men were taken to 
the Letpadan township police station where Ko Win Ko was charged pursuant to section 
353 (2) of the Penal Code on resisting arrest and sections 15 (a) and 16 (a) of the Gambling 
Act on illegal gambling. Phyoe Zaw Latt was apparently not charged immediately, but kept 
in detention. The signature sheets were confiscated. On 19 October 2006 senior lawyer 
Khin Maung Yin arrived at the Letpadan township court to represent Ko Win Ko at his trial, 
scheduled to take place on that day. However, he was informed that Ko Win Ko had been 
heard, convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment the day before (criminal case 
Nos. 652/06 and 653/06). On 25 October 2006 the lawyer attempted to gain access to his 
client at Paungte Prison, but was informed by prison director Myint Aung that he had to 
wait for some days more. It is not known whether Khin Maung Yin has been able to 
establish contact with his client. On 22 October 2006 Phyoe Zaw Latt was released from 
police custody by the Letpadan township court on a six-month good behaviour bond 
pursuant to section 5 (1) (f) and (g) of the 1961 Restriction and Bond Act. However, on the 
same day, he was rearrested by the Moenyo township police at his home and charged 
pursuant to sections 420, 465 and 468 of the Penal Code on deceit and forgery. He was 
detained incommunicado at Tharawaddy Prison awaiting trial. The trial was scheduled for 
3 November 2006 before a special tribunal within the prison, although Phyoe Zaw Latt was 
charged with ordinary offences for which the establishment of a special tribunal is not 
foreseen under Myanmar law. He was not allowed to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf 
at the trial. Concern is expressed that the arrest, detention and sentencing of Ko Win Ko 
and Phyoe Zaw Latt may be connected to their peaceful human rights activities, namely the 
legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of association and freedom of opinion and 
expression on behalf of those advocating for democratic change. In view of their 
incommunicado detention, further concern is expressed as regards their health and physical 
integrity.

270. On 21 July 2006, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 22 March 2006 concerning Thein Zan, Ko Zaw Htay and Aung </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 155 
</p>
<p>Than Htun, stating that the authorities had thoroughly investigated the matter and the 
report prepared by the Field Observation Team found that the renovation work for the road 
heading to the motorway from Ngapyin village is done on an annual basis with the 
voluntary participation of the local people. There was no collection of money by force or 
the imposition of fines. It determined after investigation that Ko Win Lwin died as a result 
of the collapse of a mound of laterite where he was working. Thein Zan, Zaw Htay and 
Aung Than Tun, who lodged the complaint, were members of NLD and with bad intent had 
made a false complaint against the State relating to forced labour. The responding police 
officer had therefore filed the lawsuit against them with the Aung Lan township court in 
accordance with the existing law and procedures. The Government pointed out that Aung 
Than Tun did not appear before the court at the first trial, when both Thein Zan's lawyer, 
Daw Hla Hla Tint, and Zaw Htay's lawyer, Tun Aung Kyi, requested that their clients be 
released upon the execution of an appropriate bond, to which the court agreed. It added that 
as Aung Than Tun lived in Taungoke township, he was not able to appear before the Aung 
Lan court on 25 October 2005. The Government added that the summons to appear before 
the Aung Lan court at the next trial could not be delivered and served as there was no one to 
receive it at Aung Than Tun's house. It asserted that the court had issued the warrant on 20 
June 2006 because the local authority could not provide the new address of Aung Than Tun 
to the Aung Lan court. Later, the Taungoke township court reported that Aung Than Tun 
had moved to Mingaladon township, Yangon Division, and then the Aung Lan court 
communicated with the authority concerned of Mingaladon township and set the date to 
serve the warrant on 20 July 2006.

271. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Myanmar for its reply to his 
communication of 22 March 2006.  While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
Government&#8217;s cooperation and its detailed information in response to this allegation, he 
wishes to obtain further information on the lawsuit against Thein Zan, Zaw Htay and Than 
Tun at the Aung Lan township court for having logded complaints to the ILO and the 
Ministry of Labour.  
 
272. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of any official reply to his 
communications of 13 April 2006, 18 October 2006, 23 October 2006 and 30 November 
2006 and urges the Government of Myanmar to provide substantive detailed information at 
the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human 
Rights Council.

</b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
regarding Hom Bahadur Bagale, who had been the subject of previously transmitted </p>

<p>communications (see E/CN.4/2004/56/Add.1, para. 1139, and E/CN.4/2005/62/Add.1, 
para. 1023). According to the allegations received, on 20 March 2006, Mr. Bagale, a police 
officer, was taken to Police Headquarters in Naxal, Kathmandu, where he was threatened 
with dismissal unless he withdrew two complaints he had lodged in court against his 
superiors. On 21 March, Hom Bahadur Bagale was subjected to ill-treatment at Police 
Headquarters. He managed to escape and took a taxi to the offices of daily newspaper 
publisher Kantipur Publications, where he described how police had beaten him, shaved 
the top of his head to humiliate and degrade him, and dragged him through puddles of dirty 
water in his uniform. Before Kantipur staff could give him any help, police officers arrived 
from the nearby Naya Baneshwor Ward Police Office and took Mr. Bagale away in a 
police van. On the same day, he was arrested by police and detained at Hanuman Dhoka 
District Police Office (DPO), where he was held incommunicado. Deputy Superintendent 
Sharad Kumar Oli told lawyers that no access to Hom Bahadur Bagale was permitted until 
the police completed their investigation. Lawyers, relatives and human rights activists tried 
to visit him in custody that day, but were turned away by police. On 28 March, Officer 
Bagale was brought before the Supreme Court and ordered released. The Court found that 
there were no permissible grounds to continue to detain him. Mr. Bagale was therefore 
released but he fears further reprisals by the Nepal Police. The National Human Rights 
Commission has been informed. Hom Bahadur Bagale has been pursuing a claim since 
2002 that he was tortured by other police officers. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture visited Hanuman Dhoka DPO on 12 
September 2005 where he interviewed Deputy Superintendent Oli who, together with 
Chief Superintendent Indra Prasad Neupane and Deputy Superintendent Ganesh Kesha, 
admitted that torture does take place in Hanuman Dhoka DPO.

276. On 22 March 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 26 April 2004 together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding an order banning public demonstrations 
and the assembly of more than five persons within the Kathmandu Ring Road and Lalitpur 
areas, and the arrest in particular of the following lawyers:<b> </b>Shyam Kumar Shrestha, Gopi 
Krishna Thapaliya, Gopi Bahadur Bhandar, Basudev Sigdel, Krishna Silwal, Laxman 
Prasar Ayral and Jeetaman Basnet. The Government replied that Gopi Krishna Thapaliya 
was arrested on 4 November 2003 in Koteshwar, Kathmandu, under TADO. He was 
released and handed over to his brother, Bahrat Thapaliya, on 14 November 2003. During

choice. No information was provided about Shyam Kumar Shrestha, Gopi Bahadur 
Bhandar, Basudev Sigdel, Krishna Silwal and Laxman Prasar Ayral. 
 
277. On 22 March 2006, the Government replied to a joint urgent appeal sent by the

Working Group on Arbitrary Detention regarding a 30-year-old man named Upendra 
Timilsena who was being detained at Mahabir Guan Himalaya Barrack, Chauni, 
Kathmandu, despite a Supreme Court order to the Chief District Officer, Kathmandu to 
release him on 23 July 2004. The Government replied that Mr. Timilsena was arrested on 8 
June 2004 under TADO, released on 28 July 2004 and handed over to his brother-in-law, 
Uddav Gautam. He was informed of the grounds for his arrest and was held in detention by

279. On 22 March 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 29 September 2004 together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of

on 8 September 2004 and released on 19 September 2004 by the order of the Appellate 
Court, Nepalgunj. Following his release, he was again found to be involved in terrorist 
activities and was therefore arrested under TADO on 20 September 2004 and released on 
20 December 2004. Then he was again rearrested on 21 December 2004 and released on 20 
March 2005. He was then again arrested on 21 March 2005, released on 17 July 2005 and

</b>283. On 2 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter<b> </b>concerning the 
situation of Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan. 
According to the information received, Mr. Hashmi was arrested on 29 October 2003 and 
sentenced under various charges on 12 April 2004 to a 23-year prison term. A matter of 
special concern to the Special Rapporteur is that Mr. Hashmi&#8217;s trial was reportedly held in 
camera and did not respect the rights of the defence. It is reported that Mr. Hashmi 
subsequently filed an application for bail, which was dismissed on 24 February 2005. He 
then lodged an application for suspension of sentence with the Supreme Court, but the 
hearing scheduled for 27 June 2005 before the Supreme Court was postponed, allegedly 
because the senior judge did not attend and the other two judges on the bench felt that they 
could not take a decision without him. It is reported that despite repeated applications by 
Mr. Hashmi's defence counsel, no other hearing has as yet been scheduled and the appeal 
against his conviction and sentence which he filed on 25 April 2004 in the Lahore High 
Court is still pending. The Special Rapporteur notes the information received that Mr. 
Hashmi is eligible for release on the basis of entitlements to remission under article 45 of 
the Pakistani Constitution and under the existing Pakistani Prison Rules.  It has also been 
reported that while the Government of Pakistan states that Mr. Hashmi has been provided 
with good prison facilities and has a separate kitchen and a servant, he has in fact been 
transferred to a prison outside Lahore where he is held in solitary confinement, with limited 
visiting rights, and though he has recently received emergency medical treatment, he has 
not been provided in the course of his imprisonment with the kind of health treatment 
recommended by physicians. Concern is expressed for the particularly long delays in 
judicial proceedings regarding Mr. Hashmi&#8217;s appeal against his conviction and sentence in 
contrast to the swiftness of the first-instance proceedings, a situation that violates the 
fundamental right to be tried without undue delay &#8211; a principle that is at the centre of the 
mandate as Special Rapporteur. Such delay may indeed be interpreted as a denial of justice.  
The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at the continuing imprisonment of a person who, 
according to the information available, should have already been released on the basis of 
legal entitlements to remission of sentence. The Special Rapporteur would appreciate 
detailed information in that specific connection. He would also appreciate urgent 
information as to Mr. Hashmi&#8217;s real conditions of imprisonment and his health condition. 
The Special Rapporteur is sure that the Government appreciates that any form of solitary 
confinement is a drastic measure which should be avoided to the extent possible as a matter 
of principle and in any case should not be imposed by any authority other than the judiciary. 
He notes that there has been no judicial order imposing this measure on Mr. Hashmi. The 
Special Rapporteur requests the Government to provide clarification on this matter and, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 160 
</p>
<p>should the reports be well founded, to take swift action to remedy the situation and release 
Mr. Hashmi if he is entitled to release.

sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y la Representante 
Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos 
humanos, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. Martin Almada, abogado y 
miembro del Comit&#233; Ejecutivo de la Asociaci&#243;n Americana de Juristas (AAJ). El Sr. 
Almada fue el objeto de una carta de alegaciones mandada el pasado 19 de octubre de 2006 
por el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de 
expresi&#243;n y la Representante Especial del Secretario General sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Sr. 
Almada se encontrar&#237;a hoy sometido a procesos penales por supuestos delitos contra el 
honor de conocidos exponentes de la dictadura de Alfredo Stroessner: el ex comisario 
Rolando Alum e Hir&#225;n Delgado von Leppel. El Sr. Almada ha sido victima de prisi&#243;n y 
torturas en las c&#225;rceles durante el periodo de la dictadura, junto a su esposa quien falleci&#243;. 
Desde entonces, el Sr. Almada ha realizado una de las m&#225;s importantes contribuciones para 
el esclarecimiento de los cr&#237;menes de lesa humanidad cometidos durante el r&#233;gimen de 
Alfredo Stroessner con el hallazgo de los archivos de la Polic&#237;a Pol&#237;tica de la dictadura 
militar de Alfredo Stroessner (&#8220;Archivos del terror&#8221;). Desde que descubri&#243; los archivos del 
terror, el Sr. Almada  promovi&#243; querella criminal contra Alfredo Stroessner, Sabino A. 
Montanaro, ex Ministro del Interior, y Pastor Coronel, ex Jefe de la Policia Politica, y pidi&#243; 
a la justicia paraguaya la investigaci&#243;n del Operativo C&#243;ndor, pacto entre los militares de la 
Argentina, el Brasil, Bolivia, Chile, el Paraguay y el Uruguay. En el a&#241;o 2000, comenz&#243; el 
hostigamiento judicial del Sr. Almada por sus comentarios hechos a la prensa sobre la 
corrupta gesti&#243;n del Administrador durante la dictadura de la Empresa binacional Yacyreta 
(Argentina/Paraguay), Magno Ferreira Falcon. En octubre de 2003, en los pasillos de los 
Tribunales el Sr. Almada trat&#243; de &quot;torturador&quot; al Comisario Rolando Agustin Alum, quien

<p>Apelaci&#243;n anulo la decisi&#243;n y ordeno reiniciar el juicio. Tambi&#233;n, en agosto de 2006, con 
motivo del fallecimiento del ex dictador Stroessner en Brasilia, el Sr. Almada declar&#243; a la 
prensa nacional e internacional que la herencia de la dictadura era la corrupci&#243;n y la 
impunidad, y que los c&#243;mplices y encubridores del dictador deb&#237;an ser juzgados y 
remitidos a la Penitenciaria Nacional. El ex Presidente de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, 
Hiram Delgado von Leppel, se dio por aludido y promovi&#243; una querella criminal por 
difamaci&#243;n y calumnia en contra del Sr. Almada, por haberle herido en su honor. La 
primera audiencia de conciliaci&#243;n estar&#237;a fijada para el 27 de noviembre. En este contexto, 
se expresa temor que las querellas criminales presentadas en contra del Sr. Almada tengan 
el prop&#243;sito de disuadirlo en el ejercicio legitimo de su libertad de expresi&#243;n y de sus 
actividades de abogado y defensor de los derechos humanos, en relaci&#243;n con sus reclamos 
de justicia respecto a las graves violaciones de derechos humanos de la &#233;poca de la

292. On 26 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> 
</b>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Elpidio de la Victoria, environmental lawyer and 
programme director of the Cebu City Bantay Dagat Commission, and his colleague 
Antonio Oposa, environmental lawyer and leader of the Visayan Seas Squadron. The two 
organizations oppose illegal commercial fishing and campaign against environmental 
degradation in the Visayan Sea Marine Triangle.  According to the information received, 
on 12 April 2006 Mr. de la Victoria was shot in the back of the head by an unknown 
gunman as he was leaving his house in Barrangay Dauis, Talisay City. He was taken to 
hospital, where he died on 13 April as a result of his injuries. It is further reported that a 
police officer has been arrested in connection with the killing of Mr. de la Victoria. It is 
alleged that in the weeks prior to his death, Mr. de la Victoria had told friends and relatives 
that those opposed to his and Mr. Oposa&#8217;s work had raised 1 million pesos to kill them 
both. It is also reported that Mr. Oposa has received serious death threats in recent weeks. 
Grave concern is expressed that the killing of Elpidio de la Victoria and the threats against 
Antonio Oposa may be connected to their work in defence of the environment, in particular 
their work to protect coral reefs in the Visayan Sea Marine Triangle from illegal fishing 
and environmental degradation. Further concern is expressed that the life of Antonio 
Oposa may be in immediate danger.

and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders concerning Ms. Elisa Tita Lubi, a pro-democracy activist, a 
member of the Board of Trustees of SELDA, an organization of former political prisoners, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 163 
</p>
<p>a participant in the Program and Management Committee and Regional Council of the 
Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and former Coordinator of the 
GABRIELA Commission on Women&#8217;s Rights. SELDA is a member organization of the 
National Alliance for the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights. According to the information 
received, the Ministry of Justice of the Philippines is currently seeking a court order for an 
arrest warrant for Elisa Tita Lubi, together with 48 other individuals, based on the charges 
of rebellion/insurrection under articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code, allegedly 
because of Ms. Lubi&#8217;s pro-democracy activities and her open criticism of the Government. 
It is reported that on 4 May 2006 the judge of the Makati Regional Trial Court dismissed 
the charges against Ms. Lubi. The Department of Justice then filed a motion against this 
judgement on the grounds that the judge had not acted impartially, and a new judge was 
assigned to the case which is scheduled to be heard again on 21 June 2006. Concern is 
expressed that the charges may be related to Ms Lubi&#8217;s legitimate activities in defence of 
human rights, in particular because of her pro-democracy activities.

</b>294. On 9 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human<b> </b>rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment regarding Ms. Aprilyn Perido, aged 26, 
organizer of the provincial chapter of the urban poor group Kalipunan ng Damayang 
Mahihirap; Ms. Eloisa Tucay, aged 24, member of the Abakbayan Youth Group; Mr. 
George Lavadia, aged 32, former spokesperson of the Erap Resign Movement and member 
of the AMA-Sugbo-KMU, and Ms. Sharon Abangan, aged 33, member of the Panaghiusa 
sa Gagmay'ng Mangngisda sa Sugbo and the Salvador Bantay Dagat Association and 
campaign manager of the Anakpawis political party.  According to the information 
received, on 1 September 2006, Mr. Lavadia and Ms. Abangan were arrested by the police 
in Talisay City on suspicion of being involved in &#8220;subversive activities&#8221;. It is alleged that 
the pistols, grenades,  laptop and documents seized from them could have been planted. 
Although the police at first denied having arrested them, it was later confirmed that they 
are being held incommunicado in police custody. On 4 September 2006, Ms. Perido and 
Ms. Tucay were arrested by the Philippines National Police Provincial Special Operations 
Group (PSOG) in front of the Wesley Divinity Seminary School of the United Methodist 
Church on Mabini Street, Cabanatuan City. They were both detained without any formal 
charge. Although PSOG initially denied having arrested them, officials later confirmed 
that they were being held in custody. They are also being detained incommunicado. 
Concern is expressed that these arrests may be connected with the legitimate activities of 
human rights defenders, particularly those in connection with the promotion and defence of 
the rights of indigenous peoples, and may represent an attempt to prevent the persons 
concerned from meeting and communicating with other international human rights 
defenders.

<p>295. On 28 August 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 19 June 2006, stating that a complaint against Ms. Lubi and other 
individuals for the crime of rebellion is pending before the trial court. The Government 
explained that the usual domestic procedure begins with a police investigation of the case. 
Afterwards, a criminal complaint is filed against the person who was found by the police to 
have committed the offence. The complaint is then filed before the municipal/city 
prosecutor&#8217;s office (of the Department of Justice) or, in places where there are no 
prosecutors, before the municipal trial court judge of the place where the criminal act was 
alleged to have been committed. The prosecutor, or the municipal trial court judge, then 
conducts a preliminary investigation or examination of the complaint. In the course of the 
investigation/examination, the prosecutor or the judge calls upon the complainant, the 
person being accused of the offence, and their witnesses to determine the veracity of the 
complaint. If the prosecutor or the judge is satisfied that there is reasonable ground to 
believe that the crime charged has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty 
thereof, he recommends the filing of the criminal case before the trial court. After the filing 
of the criminal complaint (which is also called an information), trial of the case ensues. 
Once an information is filed in the regional trial court (RTC) of the place where the offence 
was committed, it will be raffled among the different branches of the RTC to determine 
which branch will hear the case. During the trial, the accused is accorded all the rights due 
an accused under the Constitution, such as, but not limited to the following: the right to be 
presumed innocent; the right to counsel; the right to be informed of the accusation against 
him; the right to speedy, impartial, and public trial; the right to confront witnesses against 
him; and the right to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf. Upon the conclusion 
of trial, the trial court which heard the case will make a finding on the guilt of the accused 
and impose sanctions if it finds the accused guilty of the crime charged. In the present case, 
the Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management of the Philippine National 
Police (PNP) conducted an investigation of several individuals suspected of committing 
the continuing crime of rebellion. The offence of rebellion is punishable under articles 134 
and 135 of the Revised Penal Code. In the Philippines&#8217; jurisprudence, the crime of 
rebellion is by its nature a crime of a multitude, a vast movement of men and complex net 
of intrigues and plots. In committing the offence, participation by the offender in the actual 
clash of arms with government forces is not absolutely necessary. The mere fact that a 
person knowingly identifies himself with an organization which is openly fighting to 
overthrow the Government is enough to make him liable for rebellion. In the case at hand, 
it appears that following police investigation, the PNP instituted a complaint for rebellion 
against Jose Ma. Sison and 50 other individuals, including Ms. Tita Lubi, before the 
National Prosecution Service of the Department of Justice (DOJ). The complaint was 
docketed as I.S. 06-225. The charges against Ms. Lubi and her co-respondents were not 
made in relation to her legitimate activities in defence of human rights and her 
pro-democracy activities but based on the results of the preliminary investigation 
conducted by the prosecutors pursuant to their legally mandated functions and reflected in 
their findings and resolutions which are in accordance with the law, evidence, and 
established jurisprudence on the matter. 
</p>
<p> 
296. The DOJ, in the conduct of preliminary investigation of the case, asked the 
respondents to submit their written responses to the charge. However, Ms. Tita Lubi chose </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 165 
</p>
<p>not to participate in the preliminary investigation and did not answer the complaint against 
her. Records show that only 10 respondents answered the complaint. Following the 
conduct of preliminary investigation, the DOJ found probable cause against the 
respondents, including Ms. Lubi, for the crime charged. A criminal information for 
rebellion was thereafter instituted against the respondents before the RTC of Makati. The 
case was raffled to Branch 137 of the RTC which is being presided by Judge Jenny Lind 
Delorino. At about the same time, it appears that another case for rebellion was also being 
instituted against 14 individuals by the DOJ. The complaint was docketed as I.S. No. 
06-226 and is separate and distinct from the complaint instituted against Ms. Lubi. It 
appears, however, that his case was also raffled to Branch 137 of the RTC Makati City 
being presided by Judge Delorino and was docketed as Criminal Case No. 06-452. 
Subsequently, following the conduct of prelimary investigation in I.S. No 06-226, it was 
discovered by DOJ that the respondents in I.S. No. 06-225 and in I.S. No. 06-226 were 
guilty of the same act of rebellion. Hence, DOJ sought to amend the criminal information 
filed in Criminal Case No. 06-452 (which stemmed from the complaint subject of I.S. No 
06-226) by including those respondents in I.S. No. 06-225. After the accused in a criminal 
case has entered his plea, an amendment of the information against him can only be made 
with leave of court. In the instant case, the DOJ sought the permission of Judge Delorino to 
amend the information filed in Criminal Case No 06-452 against the 14 individuals. By 
amending the information in Criminal Case No. 06-452, DOJ would have had included the 
50 other individual subjects of I.S. No. 06-225 in this case (Criminal Case No. 06-452). 
Judge Delorino however denied the DOJ plea, following which DOJ filed a motion for the 
inhibition of Judge Delorino. Judge Delorino voluntarily inhibited herself from hearing 
Criminal Case No. 06-452. Judge Delorino also issued an order inhibiting herself from 
hearing the criminal case which stemmed from I.S. No. 06-225 filed against the 50 
individuals including Ms. Tita Lubi.

<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations

297. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its cooperation and for the 
detailed information it has provided in reply to his urgent appeal of 19 June 2006. He 
regrets however the absence of official replies to the joint urgent appeals of 26 April 2006 
and 9 November 2006 and urges the Government to provide substantive detailed 
information at the earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the fourth session 
of the Human Rights Council.

</b>298. On 2 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> 
</b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
concerning Isa Gamaev and Mekhti Mukhaev, aged 47, a farmer from the Itum-Kali region </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 166 
</p>
<p>of the Chechen Republic.  According to the information received, on 10 December 2005, 
Isa Gamaev was detained in the city of Nalchik in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, in 
connection with allegations that he was involved in the conflict in Chechnya. He was 
detained for three days in Nalchik.  He was then transferred to Khankala, the headquarters 
of Russian armed and security forces in the North Caucasus, where he remained for 
approximately 10 days. He was then transferred to another, unknown place of detention. 
Isa Gamaev has alleged that he was tortured in all three places, including by electric shock. 
While under duress, he made a statement to the security forces about his alleged 
participation in armed opposition groups and named Mekhti Mukhaev as a member of an 
armed group. In late December or early January Isa Gamaev was transferred to the Interior 
Ministry's Operative and Search Bureau, known as ORB-2, in the Chechen capital Grozny, 
and from there to the pre-trial detention centre (SIZO-1) in Grozny, where he was able to 
send a letter to an NGO about his treatment in detention. He subsequently withdrew his 
&quot;confession&quot;. On 5 or 6 February 2006, Isa Gamaev was reportedly again taken to ORB-2, 
where he was allegedly threatened with rape if he refused to stand by his &#8220;confession&#8221;. On 
30 December 2005, Mekhti Mukhaev was arrested in the town of Gikalo, near Grozny. At 
about 1 a.m., a group of men in masks and camouflage uniforms broke into the house 
where he was staying and took Mekhti Mukhaev to the Regional Police Department 
(ROVD) in Itum-Kali, where he was charged with hooliganism. The basis for the charge is 
not known. From there he was taken to the Regional Police Department in the Chechen 
town of Shatoi, where he was interrogated. During the interrogation, police officers 
reportedly beat him and threatened to shoot him while showing him pictures of various 
people whom they wanted him to identify. After 11 days in detention at the ROVD in 
Shatoi, Mekhti Mukhaev was transferred to ORB-2, where his interrogation continued. He 
was subjected to electric shocks and his arms and legs were bent backwards into painful 
positions. He was beaten with truncheons and was threatened that he would &#8220;disappear&#8221; if 
he did not confess to being a member of an armed opposition group. He reportedly lost 
consciousness several times.  On 18 January 2006, Mekhti Mukhaev was transferred to the 
SIZO-1 in Grozny. After almost three weeks in incommunicado detention, he was granted 
access to a lawyer and his relatives learned of his whereabouts. When his relatives visited 
him, he complained about pain in his head, legs, lungs and kidneys.  Mekhti Mukhaev told 
his lawyer that after eight or nine days of ill-treatment he had decided to &#8220;admit&#8221; to having 
given food and shelter to members of an armed opposition group. While detained in the 
SIZO, Mekhti Mukhaev retracted his confession. On 1 February 2006, Mekhti Mukhaev 
was returned to ORB-2, where security forces personnel beat him with a chair and with 
their fists and kicked him, in order to force him to repeat his &quot;confession&quot;. He was returned 
to the SIZO the following day. Mekhti Mukhaev was charged on 8 February 2006 with 
banditism (article 209 of the Russian Criminal Code). There is concern that both men are at 
risk of further torture or ill-treatment in order to force them to reaffirm their previous 
&quot;confessions&quot;.  
</p>
<p> 
299. On 16 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning 
Pavel<b> </b>Vladimirovich Shtukaturov, a Russian citizen detained against his will since 5 
November 2005 in City Psychiatric Hospital No.6 in St. Petersburg. It appears that some 
days before his detention he hired as attorney Dmitri Bartenev. On 8 and 9 November 
2005, borrowing a visitor&#8217;s mobile phone, Mr. Shtukaturov called Mr. Bartenev asking </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 167 
</p>
<p>him to come to visit him in the hospital. Mr. Bartenev went to the hospital on 9 and 10 
November, but was not allowed to see his client. It is reported that on 10 November, Mr. 
Bartenev was asked by the hospital&#8217;s Deputy Director, Dr. Sergey Shesternin, about the 
exact content of the proposed conversation with Mr. Shtukaturov. It would appear that 
when he refused to give this confidential information, Dr. Shesternin refused him access to 
his client, on the basis that Mr. Shtukaturov&#8217;s mental health condition prevented him from 
seeing an attorney. It is also alleged that Mr. Shtukaturov has filed numerous written and 
oral complaints to the hospital administration, but did not receive any response. Moreover, 
it is reported that on 10 November 2005, an urgent application was made to the European 
Court of Human Rights requesting interim measures to order the Government to allow Mr. 
Shtukaturov to see his lawyer in private. The Court invited the Government to provide an 
explanation for the situation by 30 January 2006. On 7 February 2006, Mr. Bartenev was 
contacted by Alexander Tscherbakov, a former patient of City Psychiatric Hospital No.6, 
in the same department where Mr. Shtukaturov is interned. Mr. Tscherbakov informed him 
that around 31 January 2006, the hospital increased the dosage of medication administered 
to Mr. Shtukaturov against his will. It appears that the drug has potentially damaging side 
effects and a marked sedative effect. It is also reported that around the same date, Mr. 
Shtukaturov was transferred to the observation department of the hospital and that he has 
been prohibited from using writing implements and from making telephone calls. It is 
alleged that the hospital&#8217;s recent actions coincide with the date on which the Government 
was contacted by the European Court of Human Rights, and that these acts were intended 
to intimidate Mr. Shtukaturov and Mr. Bartenev into withdrawing the application. It is also 
alleged that Mr. Shtukaturov&#8217;s situation is aggravated by the fact that he has been deprived 
of his legal capacity via proceedings which breached fair trial guarantees. Finally, it is 
reported that despite the existence of a law on psychiatric care adopted in 1999, which 
obliges the State to establish in-hospital advocacy services in psychiatric hospitals, the 
State-appointed lawyers do not perform their job properly. Psychiatric institutions are 
reportedly completely closed to public scrutiny. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>300. On 6 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> </b>the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention regarding defence 
lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin who has been imprisoned since May 2005 for &#8220;divulging State 
secrets&#8221; and &#8220;Illegal possession of ammunition&#8221;. Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s situation had already 
been brought to the Government&#8217;s attention in a communication sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 10 October 2005. According to 
new information received, Mr. Trepashkin suffers from chronic asthma and has repeatedly 
complained to the authorities about not receiving adequate treatment in prison. On 29 May 
2006, the district court in Tagil, Sverdlosk region, was to decide on his appeal to secure 
medical treatment; however, during the hearing he suffered an asthma attack and the judge 
called an ambulance. The medical corps allegedly said that he needed urgent treatment, 
because he had developed a severe form of bronchial asthma. The judge therefore decided 
to postpone the hearing and insisted that he must be taken to the hospital immediately. He 
was taken to the hospital in Nizhnii Tagil. It is alleged that on the same day, at around 10 
p.m., the head of the prison colony where Mr. Trepashkin was serving his sentence went to 
the hospital with five more persons and took him back to the prison without any judicial </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 168 
</p>
<p>authorization. It appears that the Deputy Head of the prison colony stated that Mr. 
Trepashkin would be brought to the hospital for treatment twice a week. Finally, it is 
reported that his lawyer has not been allowed to see him and that she has not been provided 
with any information regarding his current medical condition.    
</p>
<p> 
301. On 15 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, concerning Ravil 
Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov, two former detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba.  Ravil 
Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov were the subject of an urgent appeal sent to the 
Government by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
on 27 May 2004.  According to the information received, in February 2004, Ravil 
Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratov, along with five other Russian citizens, were returned 
from Guant&#225;namo Bay to Russia. In April 2005, they were arrested in connection with a 
pipeline explosion in Tatarstan in January 2005.  In detention, interrogators pulled hairs 
from Ravil Gumarov&#8217;s beard and forced vodka down his throat, which is a particularly 
offensive form of ill-treatment for abstinent Muslims, in an effort to force him to confess to 
the crime. Interrogators warned Timur Ishmuratov that they would call in his pregnant wife 
for questioning and could not guarantee the safety of the foetus. Both men confessed 
during the investigation, but subsequently withdrew their confessions in court. In 
September 2005, a jury unanimously acquitted them and a third defendant, Fanis 
Shaikhutdinov, of the charges.  However, prosecutors subsequently got approval from the 
Russian Supreme Court to annul the verdict so that the three could be tried again for the 
same crime.   On 5 May 2006, the defendants were convicted of terrorism and illegal 
possession of weapons or explosives (articles 205 and 222 of the Russian Criminal Code). 
They were also ordered to pay damages of about US$ 2,000 for property damage. Ravil 
Gumarov was sentenced to 13 years&#8217;  imprisonment and Timur Ishmuratov to 11 years and 
1 month. The third man, Fanis Shaikhutdinov, received a sentence of 15 years and 6 
months.  According to the information received, another suspect had confessed to carrying 
out the crime in July 2005; however, the defence lawyers for the three men were never 
informed of this confession.  All three have appealed their convictions to the Russian 
Supreme Court. According to the information received, two witnesses at the trial were 
detained and beaten to force them to testify against the defendants. On 31 March 2005, 
Timor Ishmuratov&#8217;s brother, Rustam Hamidullin, was detained by the Tatarstan Organized 
Crime Unit at his aunt&#8217;s house in Nefteyugansk, in Khanti-Mansiisk Province. Police held 
him for several days at Nefteyugansk police station and beat him while he was handcuffed 
to a radiator to coerce him to admit that he had witnessed preparations for the crime. Police 
then took him on the train to Tatarstan. Rustam Hamidullin was ill-treated during the 
two-day train trip. On 1 April 2005, Ildar Valeev, another witness for the prosecution, was 
called in for questioning to the Organized Crime Unit in Almetievsk, Tatarstan. He was 
subsequently sentenced to five days&#8217; administrative arrest for swearing in a mosque. He 
was held in an investigation cell in Bugulma, where he was stripped, beaten and subjected 
to threats and psychological pressure until he agreed to sign a statement saying that he had 
witnessed the explosion. He was released on 27 April 2005.  Both Rustam Hamidullin and 
Ildar Valeev withdrew their statements at their trials.

<p>302. On 20 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights 
defenders<b> </b>regarding acts of harassment against human rights defenders in the Russian 
Federation, including threats made against Ms. Svetlana Gannuchkina, President of the 
Committee of Civil Assistance, Mr. Sergey Kovalov, a founder of the Memorial Society in 
Grozny, and Ms. Lidia Yusupova, lawyer, Director of the Memorial Society and Nobel 
Peace Prize nominee. Further reports have also been received in relation to the harassment 
of Mr. Stanislav Dmitrievsky and the subsequent closure of the Russian-Chechen 
Friendship Society (RCFS), an NGO that monitors human rights violations in Chechnya 
and other parts of the North Caucasus. Mr. Dmitrievsky, Executive Director of RCFS, and 
Ms. Oksana Chelysheva, Deputy Director of RCFS, were the subjects of an urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders on 15 November 2005, and of an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders on 9 June 2005. According to new information received, an 
ultranationalist group calling itself &#8220;The Russian Will&#8221; has recently published a list, 
including personal data, of 89 individuals on a web site.  The list includes the names of 
several human rights defenders, including Svetlana Gannuchkina and Sergey Kovalov, and 
the group calls for their physical elimination. It has also been reported that on 12 October 
2006, Lida Yusupova reportedly received a threatening phone call on her mobile phone 
from an unidentified caller who said, in Chechen: &#8220;Are you pleased to be a nominee for the 
Nobel Peace Prize?  Presuming you&#8217;ll still be alive then!&#8221; Furthermore, on 13 October 
2006, a court in Nizhniy Novgorod reportedly ordered the closure of RCFS, in accordance 
with a request from the regional prosecutor&#8217;s office, on the basis that Stanislav 
Dmitrievsky had remained as Executive Director of RCFS despite being sentenced in 
February 2006 to a two-year suspended sentence for &#8220;incitement to national hatred&#8221;.  The 
court allegedly based its decision to close the RCFS on the &#8220;law to combat extremist 
activities&#8221;. The experts believe that the threats made against Svetlana Gannuchkina, 
Sergey Kovalov and Lida Yusupova should be treated seriously, particularly in the light of 
the recent killing of Anna Politkovskaya, and may represent attempts to deter human rights 
defenders in the Russian Federation from carrying out their legitimate activities. 
Furthermore, serious concerns are expressed that the amendments adopted in summer 2006 
to the  &quot;law to combat extremist activities&#8221; may be used against human rights defenders, 
and the charges brought against the RCFS based on this law may set a precedent under 
which other human rights NGOs  may  also be shut down.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>303. On 30 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, regarding<b> </b>Rustam Muminov, an Uzbek national.  According to the 
information received, at about 11.45 a.m. on 17 October 2006, Mr. Muminov was detained 
by plain-clothes police at the office of the human rights organization Civic Assistance 
Committee (Komitet &#8220;Grazhdanskoe Sodeistvie&#8221;) in Moscow.  He was then taken to a 
district court in Moscow, which ordered him to be deported to Uzbekistan because he could 
not present a residency permit. During the hearing he was not represented by a lawyer and 
was not given an opportunity to speak on his own behalf.  He was deported to Uzbekistan </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 170 
</p>
<p>on the evening of 24 October 2006. Rustam Muminov had moved from Uzbekistan to 
Russia in 2000 and acquired a temporary residency permit. In 2005, the authorities in 
Uzbekistan accused him of membership of Hizb-ut-Tahrir. In February 2006, he was 
detained in the city of Lipetsk following an extradition request from the General Procuracy 
of Uzbekistan. In September 2006, the General Procuracy of the Russian Federation 
decided not to extradite Rustam Muminov and he was released on 29 September 2006. His 
temporary residence permit expired while he was in detention, and the authorities refused 
to renew it. According to the information received, he was returned to Uzbekistan despite 
the fact that a lawyer from Komitet &#8220;Grazhdanskoe Sodeistvie&#8221; had filed an appeal with 
the court, which was due to be examined on 26 October 2006.  Furthermore, on 24 October, 
the European Court of Human Rights under rule 39 of the Rules of Court had indicated to 
the authorities that they should adopt interim measures to ensure that Rustam Muminov 
remained in the Russian Federation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
304. On 4 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with<b> </b>the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human rights 
defenders concerning the International Protection Centre (IPC), a Russian human rights 
organization that assists Russian citizens in securing access to international mechanisms of 
human rights protection, and its founder, Ms. Karinna Moskalenko. Specifically, the IPC 
has brought a number of cases before the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the 
European Court of Human Rights in relation to alleged human rights violations committed 
by the Russian authorities. According to the information received, on 17 July 2006, the IPC 
was fined US$ 170,000 by the Russian tax authorities for having failed to pay taxes in 
respect of foreign grants received between 2002 and 2005. The IPC had declared these 
grants, which were used for research and education purposes related to human rights, to the 
Russian authorities regularly during the period but  the authorities had not requested the 
IPC to pay any taxes on them.  A tax audit of the IPC has been ongoing for more than a year 
which has distracted the IPC from its activities and may possibly hold the organization&#8217;s 
directors criminally liable. Furthermore, it is reported that the IPC is unable to pay the 
aforementioned fine and will be forced to close. It is also alleged that in December 2005, a 
representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights requested 
the lawyer registry body of the Ministry of Justice to initiate disciplinary proceedings 
against Ms. Moskalenko and to have her disbarred. Concerns are expressed that these 
events may be connected with the human rights activities of the IPC and particularly Ms. 
Moskalenko&#8217;s advocacy work bringing human rights cases before the United Nations 
Human Rights Committee and the European Court of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p> 
305. On 15 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention regarding the imprisoned Russian defence lawyer 
Mr. Mikhail Trepashkin, currently imprisoned at IK 13, an open prison colony located in 
the Sverdlovsk region. Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s case was the subject of an urgent appeal by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 10 October 2005, and an urgent 
appeal by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 171 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 6 June 2006 (see 
above). Responses from the Government were received on 23 December 2005, 10 August 
and 29 September 2006; however, the experts drew the attention of the Government to new 
developments related to Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s situation according to which Mr. Trepashkin 
was still being denied access to adequate medical treatment for chronic, life-threatening 
asthma. At present, Mr. Trepashkin is suffering from asthma attacks almost every day. 
Earlier in October 2006 an ambulance had to be called from outside the prison, since 
medical staff in the prison colony was unable to provide adequate treatment for a 
particularly serious attack, during which Mr. Trepashkin lost consciousness and stopped 
breathing. In May and October 2006 Mr. Trepashkin was preliminarily diagnosed with 
asthma sufficiently serious that, under Russian law, it qualifies him for transfer to a 
hospital for treatment and for consideration of early release. However, prison authorities 
have so far refused to allow a full and thorough independent medical examination. They 
have further denied his lawyers the results of medical examinations carried out in May and 
October 2006, making it impossible for his lawyers to contest the refusal of transfer. The 
head of the health department of the prison has stated repeatedly that Mr. Trepashkin is in 
need of transfer to a hospital since the prison&#8217;s medical staff is not in a position to treat him 
adequately. Furthermore, Mr. Trepashkin has repeatedly been placed in a punishment cell, 
apparently in connection with his demands for medical treatment in accordance with the 
law. He developed further health problems due to dire hygienic conditions in prison cells, 
which are neither heated nor ventilated irrespective of the temperature. Grave concern is 
expressed as to the deteriorating health situation of Mikhail Trepashkin, which has 
reportedly become life-threatening.

Communications received  
</b> 
306. On 21 June 2006 and 21 August 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on 2 March 2006. In its reply of 21 June 2006, the 
Government indicated that the following facts have been established with regard to the 
arrest and detention conditions of Isa Gamaev and Mekhti Mukhaev. Isa Mairbekovich 
Gamaev, born in 1978 in the village of Ushkaloy in the Itum-Kale District of the Chechen 
Republic, where he still lives, has, since the spring of 2003, been an active member of 
illegal armed formations, having transferred to the armed group led by Tarkhan Gaziev 
from the armed gang led by Doku Umarov. On 24 December 2005, he was arrested in 
Nalchik on suspicion of having committed offences under article 209 (Banditry), 
paragraph 2, article 208 (Membership of an illegal armed formation) and article 317 
(Attempt on the life of a law enforcement officer) of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation.  On 24 December 2005, by a decision of the Zavodsk District Court in Grozny, 
Chechen Republic, he was remanded in custody as a preventive measure. On 30 December 
2005, Mr. Gamaev was taken to pre-trial detention centre No. 1 (SIZO-1) of the Russian 
Federal Penal Correction Service for the Chechen Republic.  During his detention in SIZO- 
1, Mr. Gamaev was, pursuant to decisions of the investigator attached to the Office of the 
Procurator of the Chechen Republic, transferred on five occasions to the temporary holding 
facility of the Operative and Search Bureau No. 2 (ORB-2) of the Central Administration 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for the Southern Federal 
District. Mekhti Makhmudovich Mukhaev, born in 1958 in the village of Dzumsoy in the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 172 
</p>
<p>Itum-Kale District of the Chechen Republic, where he still lives, has been an active 
member of Doku Umarov&#8217;s armed group since 2000.  On 13 January 2006, Mr. Mukhaev 
was arrested on suspicion of having committed offences under article 209, paragraph 2, 
article 208, article 317 and article 105 (Murder) of the Criminal Code.  By a decision of 13 
January 2006 of the Zavodsk District Court in Grozny, Chechen Republic, he was 
remanded in custody as a preventive measure. On 18 January 2006, Mr. Mukhaev was 
transferred to SIZO-1 of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service for the Chechen 
Republic.  From 1 to 2 February 2006, he was held in the ORB-2 temporary holding facility 
pursuant to a decision of the investigator attached to the Office of the Procurator of the 
Chechen Republic. On 3 February 2006, Mr. Gamaev and Mr. Mukhaev submitted 
applications, through the administration of SIZO 1, to the Office of the Procurator of the 
Chechen Republic, claiming that they had been subjected to illegal methods of 
investigation in the Shatoy District internal affairs office and the ORB-2 of the Central 
Administration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for the 
Southern Federal District.  Communications from the Office of the Procurator of the 
Chechen Republic indicate that this information was not independently confirmed.  It was 
therefore decided to refuse the application for the institution of criminal proceedings. 
 
307. In its reply of 21 August 2006, the Government indicated that on 24 December 
2005, the Office of the Procurator of the Chechen Republic instituted criminal proceedings 
against Isa Mairbekovich Gamaev on the basis of an offence under article 209, paragraph 
2, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, in connection with armed attacks 
committed by him in the Chechen Republic as part of an armed gang.  On the same day, he 
was taken into custody as a suspect.  On the basis of a court decision, he was remanded in 
pre-trial detention as a preventive measure.  During the investigation, in the presence of a 
lawyer, I.M. Gamaev made a statement regarding the crimes he had committed, as well as 
the fact that Mekhti Makhmudovich Mukhaev had aided and abetted members of an armed 
gang. On the basis of the information collected during the investigation, on 13 January 
2006 the Office of the Procurator of the Chechen Republic instituted criminal proceedings 
against M.M. Mukhaev, which was subsequently combined into one trial with the case 
against I.M. Gamaev.  On the same day, M.M. Mukhaev was taken into custody, suspected 
of banditry, and granted access to a lawyer.  When questioned, M.M. Mukhaev confirmed 
that he had aided and abetted members of the armed gang.  The court remanded him in 
pre-trial detention as a preventive measure.  The involvement of the accused in the 
commission of the offences is confirmed by all of the evidence obtained during the 
investigation.  On 12 May 2006, the criminal case in which the men were accused of 
committing offences under article 208, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code (Membership of 
an illegal armed formation) was brought before the court for consideration on the merits.  
The admissibility of the evidence gathered will be subjected to a legal evaluation.  The 
reports that I.M. Gamaev and M.M. Mukhaev were subjected to illegal methods of 
investigation have been checked by the Office of the Procurator of the Chechen Republic 
under articles 144 and 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation. 
On the basis of the results of that verification, on 9 February 2006 the Office of the 
Procurator of the Chechen Republic decided not to institute criminal proceedings.  The 
report on the checks was studied at the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian 
Federation, and there are no grounds for overturning that decision. It has been ascertained </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 173 
</p>
<p>that on 30 December 2005, M.M. Mukhaev was detained in the Itum-Kali District internal 
affairs office in the Chechen Republic in connection with his possible membership of 
illegal armed formations, following which he was released the same day.  Following a 
court decision, he was imprisoned for an administrative offence.  While serving his 
sentence, he was the subject of an investigation into the above-mentioned criminal offence. 
I.M. Gamaev and M.M. Mukhaev were held in institution IZ-21/1 of the Federal Penal 
Correction Service for the Chechen Republic throughout the investigation period.  They 
were transferred to a police holding facility for the purposes of the investigation in 
accordance with the legislation in force. According to information from the directors of the 
provisional joint group of divisions and subdivisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of 
the Russian Federation, I.M. Gamaev was not taken to Khankala, and was not the subject 
of any search activities.  In order to verify this information further, in accordance with the 
legislation on criminal procedure, on 6 May 2006, materials were taken from the file on the 
aforementioned criminal case and sent to the Office of the Procurator of the Grozny 
District of the Chechen Republic. I.M. Gamaev&#8217;s allegation regarding the illegal actions of 
law enforcement officials in the towns of Nalchik and Khasavyurt were also checked by 
the procurators&#8217; offices of those towns, under articles 144 and 145 of the Russian Code of 
Criminal Procedure.  The evidence collected was studied at the Office of the 
Procurator-General of the Russian Federation, and the decisions not to institute criminal 
proceedings were found to have been premature.  The evidence has been returned for 
further checks, the outcome of which is being monitored by the Office of the 
Procurator-General of the Russian Federation. 
 
308. On 10 August and 29 September 2006<b>, </b>the Government of the Russian Federation 
replied to the joint urgent appeal sent on 6 June 2006. In its reply of 10 August, the 
Government established that M.I. Trepashkin was pulled over by the traffic police on 22 
October 2003 while travelling in a motor car.  Upon inspecting his vehicle (in the presence 
of official witnesses), the officers discovered a pistol and seven cartridges for it under the 
rear seat. On 24 October 2003, the Dmitrov City Court remanded Mr. Trepashkin in 
custody as a pre-trial restraining measure on suspicion of an offence under article 222, 
paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Unlawful acquisition, 
storage, carrying and transportation of firearms and ammunition). In accordance with 
article 23 of the Federal Act on the remand of suspects and accused persons, health 
regulations stipulate a space requirement of 4 m2 per prisoner in a remand cell. Thus no 
violation of the law has occurred (Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s cell measures 39.6 m2 and can hold six 
other persons). The allegation that Mr. Trepashkin was rearrested in 2005 in connection 
with legal work he performed in 1999 has no basis in fact. Pursuant to the judgement 
handed down by the Moscow District Military Court on 19 May 2004, Mr. Trepashkin was 
sentenced to four years&#8217; deprivation of liberty and was directed to serve this sentence at an 
open prison in Sverdlovsk Province. Tagilstroy District Court in Nizhny Tagil (Sverdlovsk 
Province) ordered Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s release on parole on 19 August 2005.  In connection 
with irregularities in the consideration of Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s parole application and further 
to an application for cassation review filed by the Office of the Procurator of Sverdlovsk 
Province, the Criminal Division of Sverdlovsk Provincial Court overturned the decision of 
Tagilstroy District Court on 16 September 2005 and the case file was referred back with a 
view to initiating new proceedings. The decision to grant him parole having been </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 174 
</p>
<p>overturned, Mr. Trepashkin reverted to his former legal status (i.e. he was obliged to serve 
out the sentence handed down by the Moscow District Military Court on 19 May 2004), 
and accordingly was detained in Moscow on 18 September 2005 by officers of the 
Sverdlovsk Province Branch of the Federal Penal Correction Department and transported 
under guard to serve out his punishment at a correctional facility in Sverdlovsk Province. 
 
309. In its reply of 29 September 2006, the Government of the Russian Federation 
further indicated that Mikhail Ivanovich Trepashkin, born in 1957, was convicted on 19 
May 2004 by the Moscow District Military Court of offences under article 222, part 1, of 
the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Unlawful acquisition, transfer, supply, 
storage, transport or carriage of weapons or their component parts, munitions, explosive 
substances or explosive devices), as well as article 283, part 1 (Disclosure of State secrets), 
and, bearing in mind article 69, part 2 (Sentencing for multiple offences), was sentenced to 
four years&#8217; deprivation of freedom, the sentence to be served in an open prison. The 
Government indicated that M.I. Trepashkin is being provided with the requisite medical 
care by skilled personnel of the medical section of IK-13 prison. A check carried out by the 
Office of the Procurator of Sverdlovsk Province has established that the conditions in 
which he is being held in the IK-13 open prison unit do not contravene the requirements 
laid down in legislation governing the enforcement of sentences. The prisoner M.I. 
Trepashkin is allowed meetings with his lawyer in accordance with article 12, paragraph 8, 
of the Penal Enforcement Code of the Russian Federation.  During the current year M.I. 
Trepashkin has met his lawyer, L.B. Kosik, 35 times, and has also met human rights 
activists D.I. Rozhin, V.I. Popov and V.D. Kuznetsov. 
</p>
<p> 
310. On 28 December 2006, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to the 
allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on 15 September 2006. The Government 
reported that the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, during the investigation, received a number of 
complaints about illegal activities of the law enforcement bodies concerning Ravil 
Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratatov as well as the two witnesses Ildar Valeev et Rustam 
Hamidullin. However, for none of the complaints had the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the 
Republic of Tatarstan found verifying evidence. The Government also reported that, 
during the trial held in September 2005, Ildar Valeev and Rustam Hamidullin denied 
previous testimonies against the defendants Ravil Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratatov. The 
jury thus acquitted Ravil Gumarov and Timur Ishmuratatov. The Office of the Prosecutor 
of the Republic of Tatarstan appealed against the acquittal. Consequently, the Supreme 
Court of the Russian Federation ordered the annulment of the acquitting judgement and the 
conduct of further investigations. On 12 May 2006, Ravil Gumarov, Fanis Shaikhutdinov 
and Timur Ishmuratatov were convicted of terrorism and illegal storage, transfer and 
possession of explosives persuant to article 205, paragraph 3, and article 222, paragraph 3, 
of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and sentenced to 13 years, 15 years and 6 
months, and 11 years and 1 month of prison, respectively. On 29 November 2006, the 
Supreme Court of the Russian Federation amended the judgement by decreasing the prison 
sentences: Ravil Gumarov was sentenced to 9 years, Fanis Shaikhutdinov to 10 years and 6 
months and Timur Ishmuratatov to 8 years and 1 month. The remaining part of the 
judgement issued by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tatarstan of 12 May 2006 
remained in force.   </p>

311. On 28 December 2006, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to an 
urgent appeal sent on 15 December 2006 by the Special Rapporteur, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health. The Government stated that Mikhail Trepashkin has been 
imprisoned since 27 July 2005 in FGU IK-13 GU of the Russian Federal Service of the 
Execution of Punishments of the Sverdlovsk region. His health is being monitored by the 
medical department of the institution. He has consulted several medical specialists of 
municipal hospital No. 4 of Nishnyi Tagil&#8217;, e.g. in April, May, June and October 2006 he 
consulted a specialist in respiratory diseases and in October 2005 and October 2006 he 
consulted an allergist. Pursuant to the recommendations of these specialists, Mr. 
Trepashkin is being treated according to medical prison regulations. On October 2006, a 
medical emergency aid team was called at the request of Mr. Trepashkin. The medical 
specialists of the municipal hospital of Nishnyi Tagil&#8217; did not recommend that Mr. 
Trepashkin be ordered inpatient treatment. In addition, there has not been any confirmation 
that the head of the health department of the prison recommended that it was necessary to 
hospitalize Mr. Trepashkin. Furthermore, Mr Trepashkin has been in punitive confinement 
after having violated rules on the internal order of the prison. He was given a medical 
examination prior to being in punitive confinement. In addition, he has been medically 
checked and treated on a daily basis during the confinement. The punitive confinement 
prison cell of IK-13 complies with the exigencies of sanitary norms. On 19 December 
2006, Mr. Trepashkin was examined by a physician of the IK-13. Mr Trespashkin 
continues to receive ambulantory treatment; at present his medical situation does not 
require inpatient treatment.

</b>319. On 30 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter<b> </b>regarding Sekic 
Petar, who was a pilot with JAT Airways, the national airline company in Serbia, and his 
lawyer, Sekic P. Vladimir. According to information received, in 2003, Mr. Petar was fired 
by JAT Airway after 39 years and 9 months as a pilot with the company. It is alleged that 
his dismissal was due to Mr. Petar&#8217;s activities as a member of the Pilots&#8217; Union of Serbia, 
which is seeking better working conditions for pilots. In 2004, Mr. Petar filed a complaint 
against JAT Airways before the IV Municipal Court in Belgrade, alleging several 
violations of the National Labour Act. It is alleged that during the hearing held on 7 
December 2005, Judge Sanja Knezevic-Jijic, who is in charge of Mr. Petar&#8217;s case, 
instructed Mr. Vladimir not to submit important documentation for the trial, because she 
had &#8220;no intention to read it&#8221;. Moreover, it appears that there were some irregularities in the 
taking of the minutes of the hearings, and that the objections made by Mr. Vladimir in this 
regard have been ignored. It is reported that on 9 February 2006, during another hearing, 
Judge Knezevic-Jijic excluded the public from the court, in spite of legal provisions 
establishing that hearings for these trials should be public. It is alleged that she ordered 
Miroljub Rakocevic, the President of the trade union of the JAT Airways flight staff, to 
&#8220;get out&#8221; of the courtroom. It is also reported that she refused to include in the minutes Mr. 
Rakocevic&#8217;s question about the reason for this decision. Moreover, it appears that during </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 177 
</p>
<p>the hearing held on 7 December 2005, she gave a similar order to Mr. Rakocevic and to 
another trade union member. Moreover, it is reported that Judge Knezevic-Jijic behaved 
with bad manners towards the plaintiff and his lawyer. This created an atmosphere of fear 
which resulted in their refraining from taking any legal action that she could dislike. It is 
also alleged that Judge Knezevic-Jijic has suggested to the defendant the kind of legal 
action he should take, which reportedly would be against his interests. Furthermore, it is 
stated that according to National Labour Act, this kind of matter has to be decided within 
six months; whereas this procedure has taken almost two years. Finally, Mr. Vladimir has 
submitted two criminal charges to the National Prosecutor&#8217;s Office against Judge 
Knezevic-Jijic: for forging the minutes of the hearings and for infringing the law.  Mr. 
Petar, Mr. Rakocevic and Stevan Zivkovic, a pilot, also submitted complaints against 
Judge Knezevic-Jijic. It appears that the President of the IV Municipal Court, Verica Vukic 
Mihalcic, recently received Sanja Knezevic-Jijic&#8217;s statement and concluded that she did 
not commit any fault in the case relating to Mr. Sekic and the national air company, JAT 
Airways. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that in these proceedings the right to a fair 
and public hearing and the international norms and standards on judicial conduct and 
impartiality have not been respected, which would result in a denial of justice.

</b>322. On 25 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together 
with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
concerning usurpation of judicial power by local chiefs resulting in violence and 
discrimination against women. According to information received, customary law forms 
part of the common law in all parts of the country, except for the capital, Freetown, and is 
relevant to 85 per cent of the population. Under the Courts Act of 1963, the Local Courts 
are the only institutions competent to adjudicate customary law. Furthermore, according to 
the Statute the presiding judge of a Local Court is appointed by the local paramount chief 
with the approval of the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development. The 
Local Courts&#8217; rulings are supposed to be monitored by officers of the Ministry of Justice 
and may be overturned by these officers. In practice, however, most customary law cases 
are dealt with outside the Local Court system and are decided by local chiefs. The practice 
is allegedly widely tolerated by officials of the Justice Ministry. Sources allege that some </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 178 
</p>
<p>of the chiefs, who usurp judiciary powers, routinely issue rulings that violate the human 
rights of women and basic precepts of gender equality. In some criminal cases referred to 
them by community members, chiefs have reportedly carried out the functions of both 
prosecutor and judge. Examples include chiefs who have levied arbitrary charges against 
women such as &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; (a charge that does not exist in Sierra Leonean law). 
Reportedly, there have also been cases where chiefs have determined guilt without 
evidence, imposed arbitrary and exorbitant fines, imprisoned women unlawfully in their 
homes or in illegal &#8220;tribal prisons&#8221;, or threatened to, or actually did expel women from the 
community as a form of punishment. Moreover, chiefs also routinely fail to bring to the 
attention of the competent State authorities cases of rape, which members of local 
communities often first refer to the chiefs. Moreover, many chiefs also condone violence 
against women committed by their husbands. The customary law, as applied in the Local 
Courts, furthers these attitudes since it also condones domestic violence below a certain 
intensity threshold, regarding it as a justified &#8220;chastisement&#8221; of the wife.

</b>325. On 20 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression regarding Dr. Chee Soon Juan, the Secretary-General of the Singapore 
Democratic Party (SDP) and the Chairman of the NGO Alliance for Reform and 
Democracy for Asia (ARDA), who is facing a court hearing on 16 March 2006 for 
contempt of court. According to the information received, Dr. Chee has strongly and 
consistently criticized the Government&#8217;s policies. In 1993, when he was a lecturer at the 
National University of Singapore, he was fired for misusing his research funds. It is alleged 
that this occurred because he joined the SDP. When he disputed the dismissal, he was sued 
by the head of the department of the university and two other staff members for 
defamation, which resulted in a judgement against him and a fine of approximately US$ 
71,000. In November 1995, Dr. Chee was censured by the Parliament for endorsing attacks 
on the judiciary during a forum held in the United States in September 1995. It is alleged 
that these attacks were made by Francis Seow, former Solicitor General, and Christopher 
Lingle, but the Government affirmed that Dr. Chee&#8217;s failure to contradict the attacks 
constituted positive assent by &#8220;clever omission&#8221;. In 1996, the Parliament fined him and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 179 
</p>
<p>other SPD members approximately US$ 25,000 for contempt of Parliament in the context 
of a debate on health care. In addition, it is reported that in 1999 Dr. Chee was imprisoned 
on two occasions for making public speeches without a permit. Moreover, Dr. Chee was 
fined S$ 3,000 for speaking on a religious topic at Singapore&#8217;s Speaker&#8217;s Corner and S$ 
4,500 under Public Entertainment Acts. However, it is reported that he chose to serve a 
five-week jail term instead of paying these fines. In 2001, during the national election 
campaign, Dr. Chee raised questions about alleged government financial support to 
Indonesia over the previous four years. Dr. Chee was sued for defamation by former Prime 
Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong.  On 11 January 2002, Dr. Chee filed an 
application asking for. Stuart Littlemore to be admitted as his attorney. Mr. Littlemore is an 
Australian Queen&#8217;s Counsel and a defamation expert. It is alleged that Dr. Chee submitted 
this application because he could not find a local lawyer to represent him because they 
were afraid of government reprisal. It is reported that on 18 January 2002, the High Court 
ruled that Mr. Littlemore was not a fit person to practise in the country, because he had 
criticized the judiciary in an earlier case involving another opposition leader when he was 
an observer for the International Commission of Jurists. Dr. Chee made a second 
application to admit Martin Lee of Hong Kong and William Nicholas of Australia, both 
Queen&#8217;s Counsels. It is reported that the tribunal dismissed the application, declaring that 
the case was not complex enough to warrant the assistance of Queen&#8217;s Counsels. 
Moreover, it is alleged that in the meantime, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong engaged 
a Senior Counsel, which is Singapore&#8217;s equivalent to Queen&#8217;s Counsel, whereas Dr. Chee 
represented himself. On 19 August 2002, the court allowed a summary judgement, which 
allegedly took place in the Registrar&#8217;s private chambers. It is reported that as result of this 
procedure the two former Prime Ministers were awarded approximately US$ 300,000 in 
damages. Dr. Chee appealed the decision, but his appeal was rejected on 4 April 2003.   It is 
reported that Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong submitted to the courts a bankruptcy 
petition against Dr. Chee when he failed to pay. It appears that on 10 February 2006, during 
the bankruptcy hearing, Dr. Chee accused the judiciary of not being fair and independent, 
especially when it decides defamation cases involving opposition politicians. It is alleged 
that the courts declared Dr. Chee bankrupt, a consequence of which is that he would be 
barred from standing in future elections. Finally, it appears that the Attorney General 
applied for a hearing to commit Dr. Chee to prison for contempt of court and that the trial 
took place on 16 March 2006. The details of the hearing are not yet known. Serious 
concern is expressed at the Government&#8217;s recourse to criminal sanctions for Dr. Chee&#8217;s 
legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression.

326. On 27 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with<b> </b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
concerning Mr. Ravi, a human rights lawyer who is the defence counsel for 11 Falun Gong 
practitioners in four separate cases brought by the authorities. According to the information 
received, on 19 September 2006 Mr Ravi was arrested by the police near MacDonald&#8217;s 
restaurant in Yishun, Singapore, while eating with his niece and nephew. He was taken to 
And Mo Kui Police Station and interrogated without legal counsel. Neither at the time of 
arrest nor subsequently did the police notify him of any charges against him. The police 
then sent him to Changi Hospital, and informed the family only after having taken Mr Ravi </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 180 
</p>
<p>there. Mr Ravi&#8217;s youngest sister complained to the police and questioned the authority on 
which they did so. The police replied that they were still investigating Mr. Ravi, without 
specifying the charge. Mr. Ravi&#8217;s family and friends were informed that they would have 
to wait for the report of the doctor at Changi Hospital. Mr. Ravi was examined by a doctor 
on the same day and was declared to be healthy. He was released conditionally into the care 
of his family. However, two days later, despite the medical results, the police threatened 
Mr. Ravi&#8217;s family that unless they sent him to a mental hospital, the police would put Mr. 
Ravi in jail where they would have no access to him. The family agreed, and Mr. Ravi was 
forcibly committed to Adam Road Hospital and sedated against his will. He remains in the 
mental hospital. Concern is expressed that the alleged threats made by the authorities 
against Mr. Ravi may represent an attempt to prevent him from carrying out his human 
rights work, in particular his ability to legally represent 11 Falun Gong practioners whose 
cases are pending. 
<b> 
</b>327. On 22 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding 
Madasamy Ravi, who was already the subject of an joint urgent appeal of 27 October 2006 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (see above). 
According to the information received, Mr. Ravi had not requested a defence counsel. The 
Supreme Court of Singapore also suspended Mr. Ravi&#8217;s licence to practice law. It is alleged 
that the suspension is related to an exchange in court between Mr. Ravi and a judge, Ms. 
Wong Chun Ngee, three years ago during which it was alleged that Mr. Ravi showed 
disrespect for judicial authority. According to the information received, there was no 
evidence to prove the allegation since the judge concerned was unwilling to testify. In 
addition, it has been reported that Mr. Ravi was told that if he would drop the current 
controversial cases he is handling, he would be able to return to the bar after a short period 
of time. The suspension decision seems disproportionate, all the more so that on 20 June 
2006, the disciplinary committee of the court had already condemned Mr Ravi to pay US$ 
2,000 to the Law Society. While taking note of the Government&#8217;s assurances that the arrest 
of Mr Ravi had nothing to do with his professional activities, concern is expressed that the 
decision to suspend Mr Ravi&#8217;s licence may represent an attempt to prevent him from 
carrying out his human rights work as a lawyer, and in particular impair his ability to 
legally represent 11 Falun Gong practitioners whose cases are pending.

Communications received 
 </b> 
328. On 4 April 2006, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 20 March 2006, stating that the information received by the Special 
Rapporteur was not fully accurate and even misleading to some extent. It pointed out that 
Singapore has an open and transparent legal system, enabling critics of the Government 
and political opponents to freely express their views. According to the Government, many 
opposition politicians in Singapore are openly vocal in criticizing the Singapore 
Government, both within and outside Parliament, and are not sued or prosecuted purely 
because of the expression of their views. It added, however, that no one who commits 
breaches of the law, including contempt of Parliament or contempt of court, can claim </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 181 
</p>
<p>immunity from prosecution on account of being a politician. Singapore's defamation law 
follows the common law model. Those who have been defamed without justification have 
the right to seek legal redress to protect their reputations, since, according to the 
Government, the right to freedom of speech does not include a right of defamation. In the 
August 2002 proceedings, a defamation order was made summarily by a Senior Assistant 
Registrar in chambers. This is a standard procedure by a Senior Assistant Registrar in 
chambers and in many common law countries. A plaintiff who feels that the defendant does 
not have a defence may apply for summary judgement under Order 14 of the Rules of 
Court. In that case, the plaintiff made such an application and the Registrar was satisfied 
that the defendant did not have a defence. The Government indicated that on 16 March 
2006, the High Court found Dr. Chee to be in contempt of court. He compounded his 
contemptuous statement in court and was sentenced to one day's imprisonment and fined 
$6,000 (approximately US$ 3,700). Dr. Chee chose not to pay the fine and was jailed for 
another seven days in lieu of the fine. The Government asserted that with respect to the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, Dr. Chee has never been prevented from having 
legal representation. In the most recent proceedings relating to contempt of court, a lawyer 
addressed some issues on his behalf while Dr. Chee chose to address the court directly on 
other points. In earlier cases, Dr. Chee had applied for Queen's Counsels to represent him. 
The ad hoc admission of Queen's Counsels (QC) in Singapore is provided for by the Legal 
Profession Act, which sets out the conditions for such admissions, one of which is that the 
difficulty and complexity of the case should warrant the employment of a QC. One of Dr. 
Chee's applications was rejected because the case did not comply with this condition. 
Another application was rejected by the court because the QC in question had, on several 
previous occasions, made statements that showed contempt and disrespect for the 
Singapore judiciary, and would thus not have been of assistance to the court in its 
deliberations upon the proceedings. The Government concluded by stating that Singapore's 
legal and judicial system is internationally recognized to be independent, efficient and 
honest and that if Dr. Chee Soon Juan insisted on intentionally flouting the laws of 
Singapore, he should be prepared to face the courts and answer for his actions. 
 
329. On 6 December 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 27 October 2006 stating that the allegations contained in the letter 
were completely untrue and that Mr. Ravi's arrest had nothing to do with his professional 
activities, including his work with the 11 Falungong practitioners, or any of his other 
activities connected with human rights matters. According to the Government, Mr. Ravi 
was arrested by the police for disorderly behaviour in public, after a member of the public 
called the police on 18 September 2006 and reported that a barefoot man was making a 
nuisance of himself in public. Police allegedly responded to the call and found Mr. Ravi, 
who was involved in an apparent argument with another individual. Despite advice from 
his female relative and a female friend who were at the scene, as well as several warnings 
from the police to behave himself, Mr. Ravi did not do so and continued to shout 
incoherently. After failing to heed repeated warnings by the police, Mr. Ravi was arrested. 
At the time of his arrest, Mr. Ravi was informed that he was being placed under arrest for 
the offence of disorderly behaviour. The police had not decided at the time of arrest 
whether to charge Mr. Ravi in court. Mr. Ravi was interviewed while in police custody. 
During this interview, Mr. Ravi alledgedly did not request the presence of a lawyer. While </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 182 
</p>
<p>in police custody, Mr. Ravi was examined by a doctor who wrote a referral letter for Mr. 
Ravi to be further examined at the Institute of Mental Health. This referral letter was 
alledgedly handed to a female relative of Mr. Ravi who bailed him out. She told the police 
that she did not wish to send him to IMH for examination. The Government asserted that 
the police did not commit Mr. Ravi to a mental institution, forcibly or otherwise, nor was 
his family compelled by the police to do so, but a male relative of Mr. Ravi had caused Mr. 
Ravi to be admitted to Adam Road Hospital (a specialist private hospital offering 
psychiatric and psychological services) for treatment. The Government stated that Mr. 
Ravi has since been discharged from Adam Road Hospital.

communications of 20 March 2006 and 27 October 2006. The Special Rapporteur 
appreciates the Government&#8217;s cooperation and its detailed information in response to the 
allegations.  
 
331. With respect to the reply to the communication of 27 October 2006, the Special

332. On 8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together 
with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders regarding the arrest of and charges brought against Fr. 
Jesuratnam Jude Bernard Omi, Director of the Centre for Peace and Reconciliation (CPR) 
in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. According to the information received, on 24 November 2006, Fr. 
Omi was arrested after he intervened in a matter concerning a young man, Mariyanayaham 
Godfry Morris Gnanageethan, who had been detained for allegedly distributing leaflets 
issued by the Justice Peace Commission (JPC) concerning the humanitarian situation in 
Jaffna.  It is reported that Mr. Mariyanayaham had been queuing for food at the 6 CLI army 
camp when his cousin, Ms. Alanday Dinosha, spoke with him and gave him one of the 
aforementioned leaflets to read.  Members of the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) reportedly 
confiscated the leaflet and asked Mr. Mariyanayaham questions relating to its origin.  
When he referred to his cousin, troops allegedly went to her house in order to arrest her, but 
she had gone to seek the assistance of Fr. Omi, who immediately contacted and informed 
the JPC of the situation.  A member of the JPC, Fr. Francis Xavier Jeyasegaram, 
accompanied Fr. Omi, Ms. Alanday and her mother to the army camp where Mr. 
Mariyanayaham was detained. They were allegedly photographed by SLA troops and 
threatened by Colonel Manjula who said, &#8220;If you all can organize a campaign against the 
forces we will also do things against you all.  You all will face the consequences soon.&#8221; As </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 183 
</p>
<p>they left the camp with Mr. Mariyanayaham, the colonel allegedly circled around them on 
a motorcycle. Later that day, it is reported that Fr. Omi went to the High Court where 
Brigade Commander Godipilli stated that Fr. Omi and Fr. Jeyasegaram had distributed the 
leaflets to people in the queue.  Two soldiers were apparently called as witnesses but they 
never appeared before the court. It is further reported that Fr. Omi then went to the District 
Court to record a statement, but while there, army troops surrounded the office of the CPR 
and arrested Fr. Jeyasegaram.  According to reports, Fr. Omi went to the Human Rights 
Commission and recorded a statement before going to the 6 CLI camp escorted by 
members of the Non-Violent Peaceforce.  The sources indicate that the SLA transferred the 
two priests, along with Mr Mariyanayaham, Ms. Alanday and their parents, in an army 
vehicle to the police station, where they were handed over to the police.  Reportedly they 
all made individual statements and Ms. Alanday was subjected to a full-body search.  At 
approximately 10.55 p.m.the two priests were allegedly taken to the acting magistrate in 
relation to a curfew pass and were released at 11.45 p.m. and taken to the bishop&#8217;s house.  
Mr. Mariyanayaham and Ms. Alanday were reportedly released on bail the next day. On 29 
November 2006, the four individuals appeared before the Magistrate&#8217;s Court of Jaffna 
where they were allegedly charged under criminal law although they were not informed of 
the charges brought against them.  They were told that their file would be sent to the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Department and the charges against them should be announced by 31 
January 2007.  They have all reportedly been ordered not to leave the country and they will 
not be permitted to leave Jaffna before the start of the trial. Concern is expressed that the 
arrest of Fr. Jesuratnam Jude Bernard Omi may be related to his defence of the right of Mr. 
Mariyanayaham Godfry Morris Gnanageethan and Ms. Alanday Dinosha to exercise their 
freedom of expression.  Further concern is expressed that the charges against him are 
fabricated and that he will not receive a fair or impartial trial.

335. On 13 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together 
with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, regarding Abdella Salih Hussain Mohamed, aged 35. According to the 
information received, on 25 December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was sentenced by the Zalingy 
Special Criminal Court to cross amputation of his right hand and left foot, and to a total of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 184 
</p>
<p>six years&#8217; imprisonment in connection with charges of murder and robbery at the 
Alhisahisa Internally Displaced Persons Camp, Zalingy. He was detained by the Zalingy 
police on 3 June 2005, and on 7 September, the case was transferred to the Special 
Criminal Court. Following presentations by both the prosecution and defence, Mr. 
Mohamed was found guilty on the same day. The Special Court, established in accordance 
with the State of Emergency Act 1998 by the Governors of Southern and Northern Dafour 
Provinces, deals with crimes of armed robbery, crimes against the State, as well as crimes 
relating to drugs and public nuisance. According to the information received, including 
admissions from the Sudanese Minister of Justice, the Special Criminal Court does not 
follow correct judicial procedures and internationally recognized principles of due process. 
The penalty for armed robbery (<i>Hiraba</i>) under article 168 of the Penal Code provides for, 
among other things, &#8220;&#8230;the amputation of the right hand and left foot if his act results in 
grievous hurt or robbery of property equivalent to the minimum (<i>Nisab</i>) for capital 
theft&#8230;.&#8221;

</b>336. On 19 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> 
</b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment concerning Mossaad Mohamed Ali&#184; lawyer and Coordinator of the Amel 
Centre for the treatment and rehabilitation of victims of torture in Nyala, and Adam 
Mohammed Sharief, member of the Amel Network of Lawyers in Nyala. According to the 
information received, on 15 May 2006, at 9.30 a.m., Mossaad Mohamed Ali and Adam 
Mohammed Sharief were summoned for questioning at their offices by officers from the 
National Security Bureau (NSB) in Nyala. They were first detained without charges for 13 
hours in a cell in the NSB offices and were eventually released at 10 p.m. on the same day. 
On 16 May 2006, in the early morning, they were summoned once again to the NSB offices 
where they were arrested. No reason was given for their arrest and their families, legal 
counsel and UNMIS were denied access to them. In view of their incommunicado 
detention, concerns have been expressed that they may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. 
Additionally, concern has been expressed that their detention and arrest may be related to 
their activities as human rights defenders and lawyers, particularly in view of the absence 
of charges.  
 
337. On 8 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders regarding Mossad Mohamed Ali, Ms. Najat DafaAlla, Ms. Rasha Souraj  and 
Ms. Ebtisam Alsemani, lawyers and volunteers with the Amel Centre. Mr. Ali was already 
the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 19 May 2006 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders (see 
above). According to the information received, on 1 August 2006 Mr. Ali and Ms. 
DafaAlla reported to the NSB office in response to an order they had received from the 
Attorney General, to attend an interrogation in relation to a case that had been filed against 
them. The order reportedly accused them of sending false reports and disclosing </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 185 
</p>
<p>information relating to Sudanese military forces in Nyala. On arrival at the NSB office, Mr. 
Ali and Ms. DafaAlla were reportedly separated and interrogated regarding events in Otash 
camp for internally displaced persons that took place after the signing of the Darfur Peace 
Agreement in May 2006. Allegedly, five residents of the Otash camp had been arrested 
while participating in a peaceful demonstration and Mr. Ali, Ms. DafaAlla and Ms. 
Alsemani had written a letter to the Security Committee requesting information on the 
whereabouts of these five individuals. During their interrogation, Mr. Ali and Ms. 
DafaAlla were allegedly accused of spreading false information and of being a threat to 
national security. They were released and told that their case would be referred to the 
Attorney General for prosecution. Mr. Ali was reportedly previously arrested on 16 May 
2006 and released on 20 May 2006 without charges. He was interrogated in relation to the 
activities of the Amel Centre, and accused of opposing the Darfur Peace Agreements. It is 
also reported that on 29 July 2006, Ms Alsemani received a letter from the Attorney 
General's office ordering her to the NSB office on 30 July 2006 for interrogation in relation 
to offences against the State. Ms Alsemani is reportedly currently in Khartoum and will 
have to attend the interrogation on her return to Nyala. Concerns are expressed that the 
above events are connected with the activities of  Mr. Ali,  Ms. DafaAlla, Ms. Souraj and 
Ms. Alsemani in defence of human rights, in particular the rights of internally displaced 
persons and victims of the armed conflict in Southern Darfur. Further concerns are 
expressed that these most recent events may form part of a campaign of harassment against 
the staff of the Amel Centre, aimed at preventing it from carrying out its human rights 
work.

<p> 
338. On 29 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Saleh al-Sayer Muhammad, Fursha of Foro Baranga (a member of 
the Native Administration), Muhamed Saleh Ismail, Bara Benzi, Nasr al-Din Abakir 
Younes, Adam Khamis Idriss, Juma Adam, Yousif Zackaria and Adam Abubaker and four 
other unidentified individuals. According to the information received, between 3 and 9 
September 2006, the above-mentioned individuals were arrested by members of the 
National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) in and near Foro Baranga town, 
Western Darfur.  All 12 detainees were reportedly beaten at the NISS office in Foro 
Baranga by men in military uniforms. They were allegedly beaten with sticks, whips and a 
car fan-belt. On 11 September 2006, Adam Khamis Idriss, Juma Adam, Yousif Zackaria 
and Adam Abubaker were reportedly released in Foro Baranga.  On 16 September 2006, 
the Acting Director of NISS confirmed that the NISS was holding seven of the detainees 
and that they had not been produced before a prosecutor, despite the 72-hour time-limit 
established by the 1999 National Security Act. The prosecutor did not refer to the 
whereabouts of the eighth detainee.  The detainees were denied access to their family 
members, lawyers, judicial authorities and medical treatment. On 19 September 2006, six 
of the detainees were taken to the NISS office in Habila, where people heard screams 
coming from the office. The following day, the detainees were taken to the El-Geneina 
office, where they remained in incommunicado detention. It was further reported that the 
detention of these 12 persons was carried out in response to a rebel attack on a Central </p>

</b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment regarding Mohammed Ghanem, a novelist and journalist, resident 
in Ar-Rika, North Syria. According to the information received, Mohammed Ghanem was 
arrested by officers of an armed patrol of the Syrian Military Intelligence Department 
(SMID) at his residence in Ar-Rika on 31 March 2006. The SMID immediately transferred 
him to Damascus, where he is currently detained in the &#8220;Palestine Branch&#8221; of the Military 
Intelligence Security (Branch 235). It is not known whether he has been charged with any 
offence, and he has not been allowed to meet either his lawyer or members of his family. 
The Special Rapporteurs are concerned that his detention might be due to his having posted 
articles denouncing human rights violations in Syria on his web site, &#8220;Souriyoun&#8221;. 
Considering his allegedly incommunicado detention, the Special Rapporteurs were further 
concerned that he might be at risk of torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment.

the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression,  and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Muhammad Ghanem, online journalist with the news

<p>of the board of the Defence Commission for Human Rights and Democratic Freedoms in 
Syria. According to the information received, on 31 March 2006 Mr. Ghanem was arrested 
at his home in al-Raqqah by military intelligence officers. He was immediately transferred 
to Damascus and detained in the &quot;Palestine Branch&quot; of the Military Intelligence Security 
(Branch 235). On 15 May he appeared before a military court in the northern town of 
al-Raqqah on charges of publishing false news about human rights violations committed 
by the Syrian authorities. He was then transferred to al-Raqqah al-Markazi prison where he 
remains in detention. Mr. Ghanem, who had been previously arrested and detained for 15 
days by military intelligence officers in March 2004, has not been allowed to see his lawyer 
or his family since his arrest. On 16 May 2006 Mr. Darwish and Mr. Merri were arrested 
and detained by Syrian security forces in Damascus. Their whereabouts remain unknown 
and reportedly they have had no access to their families or to legal representation since 
their arrest. Furthermore, on 17 May 2006 Anwar Al Bunni, Sulieman Al Shamr, Ghaleb 
Ammar, Sulieman Al Shamr, Khalil Hussein, Mahmoud Issa and Abbas Abbas were 
arrested and detained by security forces in Damascus. Their whereabouts remain unknown. 
Reportedly, they have had no access to their families or to legal representation since their 
arrest. It is reported that Mr. Darwish, Mr. Merri, Mr. Al Bunni, Mr. Al Shamr, Mr. 
Ammar, Mr. Al Shamr and Mr. Abbas had recently signed a petition calling for 
improvement of relations between Syria and Lebanon. Grave concern is expressed that 
these arrests and detentions are connected with the activities of the above-named people in 
defence of human rights, in particular their activities in defence of the right of freedom of 
opinion and expression in the Syrian Arab Republic.

Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human

Mr. Abbas, Mr. Hussein, Mr. Issa and Mr. Darwish were the subjects of an urgent appeal 
sent jointly by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, </p>

on 19 May 2006 (see above). According to new information received, the 
above-mentioned people were arrested on 17 and 18 May 2006 and are currently detained 
in Adra Prison in Damascus. They have been charged with &#8220;weakening nationalist feelings 
and inciting racial or sectarian strife&#8221;, under article 285 of the Syrian Penal Code. These 
charges allegedly relate to a petition calling for the improvement of relations between Syria 
and Lebanon that was signed by the above-named individuals. Should they be convicted of 
these charges, they may face sentences of up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. It is further 
reported that during their interrogation they were beaten by prison officers and that they 
have been allowed to meet with their lawyers only once since their arrest. Mr. Al Bunni has 
allegedly been on hunger strike since his arrest on 17 May 2006 in protest at his arrest and 
detention. It is reported that he is currently in a weakened state of health. Grave concern is 
expressed that these charges are related to the activities of the above-named people in 
defence of human rights, in particular because of their defence of the right to freedom of 
expression and opinion. Further concern is expressed that they are being denied adequate 
access to legal representation. 
</p>
<p> 
344. On 27 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and<b> </b>protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders concerning Nizar Ristnawi, human rights defender and 
founding member of the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR-S). Mr. Ristnawi, 
along with Muhammad Ra&#8217;dun, was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 1 
July 2005. According to the information received, on 19 November 2006, Mr. Ristnawi 
was reportedly sentenced by the Supreme State Security Court to four years&#8217; imprisonment 
for &#8220;spreading false news&#8221; and &#8220;insulting the President&#8221;. Mr. Ristnawi was arrested on 18 
April 2005 and detained incommunicado for two weeks before his family was informed by 
Military Security that he was in their custody in Hama. He was reportedly held 
incommunicado until August 2005 when his wife was allowed to visit him on a monthly 
basis.  
 
345. Proceedings before the Supreme State Security Court reportedly fail to meet 
international fair trial standards. In particular, defendants have restricted access to lawyers, 
confessions are admissible as evidence even when they are alleged to have been extracted 
under torture and allegations of torture are not investigated by the court, and convicted 
prisoners do not have the right to appeal the sentences. Concerns are expressed that the trial 
of Mr. Ristnawi has been unfair and falls short of international standards, and that the 
charging and sentencing of Mr. Ristnawi may be in connection with his legitimate 
activities in the defence of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic.

<p>346. On 8 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture regarding <b>&#8216;</b>Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali, 
21 years of age, student; Husam &#8216;Ali Mulhim, 21 years of age, student; Tarek Ghorani, 
student; Maher Ibrahim, around 25 years of age, shop owner; Ayham Saqr, around 30 years 
of age, employee of a beauty salon; &#8216;Alam Fakhour, around 26 years of age; &#8216;Omar &#8216;Ali 
al-&#8216;Abdullah, around 21 years of age, student; and Diab Sirieyeh, around 26 years of age, 
part-time student, all currently detained at Sednaya Prison near Damascus. The cases of 
Mr. &#8216;Ali and of Mr. Mulhim were already the subject of an urgent appeal by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 21 February 2006. 
While the Special Rapporteurs appreciated the response of the Government of the Syrian 
Arab Republic of 30 August 2006 in these cases, the Special Rapporteurs asked the 
Government for further clarification in view of new information received. In its reply the 
Government explained that both persons have taken part in activities hostile to the State 
and incited public unrest using the Internet, which are acts penalized by article 307 of the 
Syrian Criminal Code as &#8220;any act, writing or correspondence aimed at, or resulting in, the 
creation of confessional or racial strife or encouragement of conflict between the 
confessional groups and different ethnic communities of the nation.&#8221; The two persons have 
further established a cell of an organization that advocates acts of terrorism against society 
and the State and solicits support from abroad, which is punishable under articles 306 and 
364 of the Syrian Criminal Code. They have accordingly been arraigned before the Higher 
State Security Court on 4 April 2006. In addition to the request for additional information 
on these cases, the attention of the Government was also drawn to new information 
received on the other persons concerned. According to  the new allegations, the 
above-mentioned individuals were arrested between 26 January and 18 March 2006 and 
have been detained incommunicado ever since, three months in solitary confinement. 
While in detention they were ill-treated during interrogation at the Air Force Intelligence 
Branch in the town of Harast, near Damascus. The trial of the eight persons commenced on 
26 November 2006 before the Higher State Security Court in Damascus. Each defendant 
denied the charges brought against him, since their confessions had been obtained by 
resorting to ill-treatment. The eight individuals had been denied access to counsel until the 
hearing in court, where they were able to meet briefly with their lawyers, in the presence of 
guards. At least one of the persons was allowed to meet with his parents inside the 
courtroom for three minutes with a guard present. The families of the defendants were not 
permitted to provide them with warm clothing on the occasion of the court hearing in order 
to protect them from the chilly conditions in prison. The trial has been adjourned until 14 
January 2007. According to the Government&#8217;s reply, &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali and Husam &#8216;Ali 
Mulhim have been charged under articles 306, 307 and 364 of the Syrian Criminal Code. 
Reportedly, however, all except &#8216;Ali Nizar &#8216;Ali are charged under article 278 of the Syrian 
Criminal Code, which makes it a criminal offence to take action or make a written 
statement or speech which could endanger the State or harm its relationship with a foreign 
country, or expose it to the risk of hostile action by that country. Furthermore, all eight are 
reportedly charged under article 287 of the Syrian Criminal Code, which penalizes the </p>

</p>
<p>&#8220;broadcasting of false news considered to be harmful to the State&#8221;. During the hearing the 
judge accused the defendants of having established links with an opposition party based 
outside Syria. Concern was expressed as regards the physical integrity of the 
above-mentioned persons, particularly in view of their continued incommunicado 
detention and alleged ill-treatment in prison. Further concern is expressed with respect to 
their general state of health and well-being since they have reportedly not been provided 
with proper clothing against the cold or not permitted to receive such clothing from their 
families.

347. On 10 July 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 11 April 2006 concerning Mohammed Ghanem. The Government 
reported that Mr. Ghanem was arrested on 31 March 2006 for carrying out activities hostile 
to the State, calling for the dismemberment of Syria and the establishment of sectarian and 
ethnic statelets.  Such activities are punished by Syrian law in accordance with articles 286 
to 307 of the Syrian Criminal Code. Mr. Ghanem was brought before the military 
prosecution department in Damascus on 7 April 2006 for an examination of the charges 
against him and not, as the letter claims, for writing articles condemning human rights 
violations in Syria.  Mr. Ghanem is a Syrian citizen and Syrian law guarantees his civil 
rights just like those of all Syrians.  It also guarantees him protection against torture and 
inhuman treatment.

349. On 30 October 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent on 2 
June 2006. The Government provided the following information concerning Anwar 
al-Bunni: 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Anwar al-Bunni provided offices for the Institute for Assistance and Solidarity, 
based in Brussels, to carry out civil society training.  He also employed a local 
Syrian team and equipped the centre with the necessary furnishings.  He did this </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 191 
</p>
<p>before the organization had received a licence to operate in Syria.  This is in 
contravention of the regulations and laws in force; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Mr. Al-Bunni published information on the Internet making false allegations 
against Syria of a kind likely to damage the country&#8217;s standing in the domestic 
and international arenas.  This is punishable under articles 286 and 287 of the 
Syrian Criminal Code; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Mr. Al-Bunni signed the Damascus-Beirut Declaration, which contains 
allegations and assertions made by a Lebanese faction that is hostile to Syria.  
He encouraged intellectuals to sign the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Mr. Al-Bunni accepted support from foreign Governments and entities that are 
hostile to Syria.  This is punished under article 264 of the Syrian Criminal 
Code; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; A legal case has been brought against Mr. Al-Bunni for battery and assault of 
Ms. Ghada al-Hamawi.  When this woman was examined by a police doctor, 
she was found to have bruising on the stomach and head and abrasions on the 
stomach and in the pelvic area.  She was prescribed 20 days of treatment and 10 
days off work.  The incident happened after lawyer Anwar al-Bunni refused to 
return the money he had taken from her pursuant to a contract engaging him as 
her defence counsel.  The case is still before the courts.

</b>the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding the situation of 
Angkhana Neelaphaijit, wife of the disappeared human rights lawyer Somchai Neelaphaijit 
who was the subject of an urgent appeal by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 17 March 2004 and by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders on 25 June 2004. Ms. Neelaphaijit was the subject of a prompt 
intervention letter addressed to the Government of Thailand by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances on 22 July 2005. Ms. Neelaphaijit was also the subject of an urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 7 September 2005. According to information 
received, Angkhana Neelaphaijit was reportedly threatened on 21 March 2006, by a man 
believed to be a State officer or acting on behalf of the State (the name is known to the 
experts). The man allegedly went to her home and warned her against travelling, saying, 
&#8220;you may get in an accident or find a bomb under your car.&#8221; This new threat occurred a day 
before Mrs. Neelaphaijit lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman of Thailand against four 
policemen in relation to her husband&#8217;s case and while the search for her husband continued 
west of Bangkok. It is reported that the person who made the threat had previously gone to 
Ms. Neelaphaijit&#8217;s residence, once on 12 March 2006 and again in April 2005, when he 
warned her against contact with the United Nations and the media regarding the case of her 
disappeared husband.  The Special Rapporteurs reiterated their concerns, expressed in their 
communications of 17 March 2004, 25 June 2004 and 7 September 2005, that these threats 
are a means of intimidating Angkhana Neelaphaijit in order to dissuade her from 
continuing to seek truth and justice in the case of her husband.

356. On 21 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders<b> </b>regarding the trial of Ms. Ticha Na Nakorn, former coordinator of the Women 
and the Constitution Network. According to the information received, Ticha Na Nakorn is 
currently the subject of a criminal defamation case for publicizing allegations of the sexual 
harassment of a female news reporter by a senior police officer in 2003.  She was acquitted, 
along with 16 other defendants, in a civil case brought by the former National Chief of 
Police, Police General Sant Sarutanont, in November 2005, but the Public Prosecutor has 
decided to proceed with the criminal case against her.  The cases against all of the </p>

Page 194 
</p>
<p>defendants in the civil suit were heard together; however, it is reported that charges have 
not been brought against all of the defendants who were party to the civil suit and those that 
will be brought before the criminal court will be heard individually.  It is reported that the 
charges filed by the former National Chief of Police were investigated by his subordinates; 
therefore it is feared that the procedure followed was not independent or impartial as the 
complainant and investigator were the same. Concerns are expressed that the criminal suit 
brought against Ticha Na Nakorn is an attempt to prevent her from carrying out her 
activities in defence of human rights, in particular the rights of women. Further concern is 
expressed that Ticha Na Nakorn may not receive a fair trial.

Selon des nouvelles all&#233;gations re&#231;ues, M. Abbou, emprisonn&#233; depuis le 1er mars 2005,

l&#8217;auraient battu. Pour protester contre ces mauvais traitements, M. Abbou aurait entam&#233; 
une gr&#232;ve de la faim le 11 mars 2006. Depuis lors, ses conditions de sant&#233; se seraient 
consid&#233;rablement aggrav&#233;es et il n&#8217;aurait pas pu avoir acc&#232;s &#224; des soins m&#233;dicaux

pendant trois minutes seulement avant d&#8217;&#234;tre &#233;loign&#233;e par les gardiens, tandis que sa 
femme, Samia Abbou, serait syst&#233;matiquement suivie par les forces de l&#8217;ordre sur le trajet 
entre la capitale et la prison de Kef.  En raison de la pression exerc&#233;e sur elle et son mari, 
Mme Abbou aurait d&#251; renoncer &#224; voir son mari et se contenterait, les jours de visite, d&#8217;un 
sit-in pacifique &#224; l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur de l&#8217;&#233;tablissement p&#233;nitentiaire. Le 20 mars 2006, Mme

elle aurait particip&#233; &#224; des r&#233;unions relatives &#224; l&#8217;appel &#224; la lib&#233;ration de son mari. Les 
affaires de Mme Abbou auraient fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une fouille totale et la photo de son mari

&#233;t&#233; victime pendant ce temps d'insultes et d&#8217;agressions verbales de la part de policiers. Un

que d&#8217;autres avocats auraient tenu un sit-in devant leurs locaux en signe de protestation 
contre des attaques dont l&#8217;ordre des avocats aurait fait l&#8217;objet les jours pr&#233;c&#233;dents. Selon les 
informations re&#231;ues, le 8 mai le Minist&#232;re de la justice aurait pr&#233;sent&#233; au Parlement un 
projet de loi, pr&#233;par&#233; de fa&#231;on unilat&#233;rale, portant cr&#233;ation d&#8217;un Institut de formation des 
avocats, alors qu&#8217;une commission mixte associant le Conseil de l&#8217;ordre des avocats et le 
Minist&#232;re de la justice aurait au pr&#233;alable travaill&#233; sur un projet de loi commun. La cr&#233;ation 
de cet Institut ferait partie d&#8217;un programme de modernisation de la justice financ&#233; par 
l&#8217;Union europ&#233;enne qui pr&#233;voirait la participation active du Conseil de l&#8217;ordre des avocats 
dans la d&#233;finition et la gestion de cette institution. Le 9 mai, une d&#233;l&#233;gation du Conseil de 
l&#8217;ordre des avocats qui se serait dirig&#233;e vers le Parlement en vue d&#8217;informer les d&#233;put&#233;s de 
leurs propositions aurait &#233;t&#233; bloqu&#233;e par les forces de police qui, en usant de violences 
verbales et physiques, auraient quadrill&#233; le quartier et barr&#233; la voie aux membres du 
Conseil de l'ordre en les emp&#234;chant de rejoindre le Parlement. Le 9 au soir, la Chambre des 
d&#233;put&#233;s aurait adopt&#233; le projet de loi en question, dans la version &#233;labor&#233;e de fa&#231;on 
unilat&#233;rale par le Minist&#232;re de la justice et sans avoir pu conna&#238;tre les propositions du 
Conseil de l&#8217;ordre des avocats. Depuis lors, il serait interdit aux avocats de se rendre &#224; la 
Maison du barreau. 
 
361. Le 3 octobre 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la Repr&#233;sentante 
sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme, 
le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et 
d&#8217;expression, a envoy&#233; une lettre d'all&#233;gation sur la situation de Mme Wassila Kaabi, 
magistrate. Mme Wassila Kaabi avait d&#233;j&#224; fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une communication envoy&#233;e par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats et la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale 
du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme le 7 
septembre 2005.  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 27 septembre 2006 dans l'apr&#232;s-midi, 
Mme Wassila Kaabi aurait &#233;t&#233; bloqu&#233;e &#224; l'a&#233;roport de Tunis-Carthage par la police, qui 
l'aurait emp&#234;ch&#233;e de quitter le territoire pour se rendre en Hongrie afin de participer au 
congr&#232;s de l'Union internationale des magistrats (UIM) qui s'y tenait. Ce refus de la laisser 
voyager aurait &#233;t&#233; motiv&#233; par la non-pr&#233;sentation de l'autorisation de quitter le territoire 
exig&#233;e pour les fonctionnaires en service. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, Mme Wassila 
Kaabi, &#233;taitt en cong&#233; annuel du 25 septembre au 24 octobre 2006 et, de ce fait, elle avait 
pour seule  obligation d'aviser l'administration, chose qu'elle a faite par lettre recommand&#233;e 
avec accus&#233; de r&#233;ception et par voie administrative par une demande pr&#233;sent&#233;e le 19 
septembre 2006. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es que ce refus de laisser Mme Wassila Kaabi 
voyager ne soit une mani&#232;re de l&#8217;emp&#234;cher de participer &#224; des activit&#233;s associatives 
internationales en faveur de la promotion de l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance du pouvoir judicaire.  
 
362. Le 22 d&#233;cembre 2006 le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire

sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, ont 
adress&#233; un appel urgent concernant M. N&#233;jib Hosni, avocat sp&#233;cialis&#233; dans les droits de 
l&#8217;homme et membre fondateur du Conseil national des libert&#233;s en Tunisie (CNLT), M. </p>

Moncef Marzouki, ancien pr&#233;sident de la LTDH, ancien porte-parole du CNLT et dirigeant 
du CPR, Mme Samia Abbou, &#233;pouse de l'avocat et d&#233;fenseur des droits de l'homme 
Mohammed Abbou, , le journaliste Slim Boukhdir et l'avocat Samir Ben Amar. Concernant 
les personnes susmentionn&#233;es, 15 appels urgents pr&#233;c&#233;dents ont &#233;t&#233; envoy&#233;es au 
Gouvernement entre mars et novembre 2006. Le 3 d&#233;cembre 2006, plusieurs personnes, 
dont  N&#233;jib Hosni, Abderraouf Ayadi, Abdelwahab Maatar,  Tahar Laabidi et Ali Ben 
Salem, aurait &#233;t&#233; insult&#233;es, menac&#233;es, et parfois m&#234;me malmen&#233;es par les forces de l&#8217;ordre 
devant le domicile de  Moncef Marzouki &#224; qui elles souhaitaient rendre visite, &#224; Tousse. Ce 
dernier serait inculp&#233; d&#8217;&#171; incitation &#224; la d&#233;sob&#233;issance civile&#187; pour avoir appel&#233; le peuple 
tunisien, lors d&#8217;une interview diffus&#233;e par la cha&#238;ne Al-Jazira le 14 octobre 2006, &#224; 
protester pacifiquement contre les restrictions impos&#233;es &#224; leurs droits fondamentaux. M. 
Marzouki serait passible de trois ans de prison. Le groupe de personnes aurait &#233;galement 
&#233;t&#233; soumis &#224; de nombreux contr&#244;les d&#8217;identit&#233; lors de leur trajet entre Tunis et Tousse. 
Certains de ces contr&#244;les auraient dur&#233; plusieurs heures. Enfin, M. Marzouki aurait &#233;t&#233; 
emp&#234;ch&#233; de rejoindre ses amis en partance pour Tunis. Le chef de la police lui aurait 
clairement signifi&#233; qu&#8217;il avait re&#231;u des instructions en ce sens. Le 7 d&#233;cembre 2006, Mme 
Abbou, M. Marzouki, M. Boukhdir et M. Ben Amar auraient &#233;t&#233; stopp&#233;s &#224; trois reprises par 
des barrages routiers tenus par les forces de l&#8217;ordre alors qu'ils se rendaient &#224; la prison du 
Kef (&#224; 170 km de Tunis) o&#249; est actuellement emprisonn&#233; Mohammed Abbou. Au troisi&#232;me 
barrage, une quarantaine de policiers les auraient bloqu&#233;s, leur interdisant de reprendre la 
route que ce soit dans un sens ou dans l&#8217;autre. Leurs papiers auraient &#233;t&#233; confisqu&#233;s. Le 
groupe de personnes aurait ensuite &#233;t&#233; autoris&#233; &#224; continuer sa route, mais il aurait tout 
d'abord subi une agression &#224; la sortie d'un restaurant o&#249; ils auraient &#233;t&#233; pris &#224; partie par un 
groupe de jeunes qui les auraient insult&#233;s et bouscul&#233;s ; puis devant la prison de Kef o&#249; une 
trentaine de personnes les auraient attendus et s&#8217;en seraient pris physiquement &#224; Mme 
Abbou, M. Marzouki, M. Boukhdir et M. Ben Amar et auraient d&#233;t&#233;rior&#233; leur v&#233;hicule. Il 
est all&#233;gu&#233; que des policiers auraient assist&#233; &#224; la seconde sc&#232;ne et l&#8217;auraient m&#234;me film&#233;e, 
mais se seraient abstenus d&#8217;intervenir. Mme Abbou, M. Marzouki, M. Boukhdir et M. Ben 
Amar se seraient finalement r&#233;sign&#233;s &#224; rentrer &#224; Tunis, sans avoir pu rendre visite &#224; 
Mohammed Abbou, et tr&#232;s choqu&#233;s par ces &#233;v&#233;nements successifs. Des pr&#233;occupations ont 
&#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es selon lesquelles les actes de harc&#232;lement dont les personnes susmentionn&#233;es 
auraient &#233;t&#233; victimes seraient li&#233;s &#224; leurs activit&#233;s de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme en 
Tunisie et s&#8217;inscriraient dans un contexte d&#8217;intimidation et de r&#233;pression syst&#233;matique &#224; 
leur encontre.

363. Le 10 mars 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la lettre envoy&#233;e le 12 mai 2005. Le 
Gouvernement informe le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial que M. Abbou a comparu le 2 mars 2005 
devant le juge d&#8217;instruction pr&#232;s du Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Tunis. Le 
Gouvernement ajoute que M. Abbou faisait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une instruction d&#233;clench&#233;e par le </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>parquet de Tunis sur la base d&#8217;une plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e par l&#8217;une de ses consoeurs concernant 
des pr&#233;judices corporels qui aurait entra&#238;n&#233; l&#8217;admission de celle-ci aux urgences m&#233;dicales 
et un arr&#234;t de travail d&#8217;un mois. M. Abbou a &#233;t&#233; &#233;galement mis en examen pour diffamation 
des autorit&#233;s judiciaires et incitation de la population &#224; enfreindre les lois. Le 
Gouvernement a d&#233;clar&#233;a &#233;galement que, traduit devant la Chambre correctionnelle pr&#232;s 
du Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Tunis le 28 avril 2005, l&#8217;accus&#233; a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; des 
circonstances att&#233;nuantes, puisqu&#8217;il n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233; qu&#8217;&#224; deux ans d&#8217;emprisonnement 
pour violences caract&#233;ris&#233;es sur sa consoeur ayant entra&#238;n&#233; une incapacit&#233; permanente de 
10 % et &#224; 18 mois de prison pour la diffamation des autorit&#233;s judiciaires et la diffusion de 
fausse nouvelles de nature &#224; perturber l&#8217;ordre public.  La peine a &#233;t&#233; confirm&#233;e en appel le 
10 juin 2005. Le Gouvernement a ajout&#233; que la proc&#233;dure judiciaire, ayant abouti &#224; la 
condamnation de M. Abbou, s&#8217;&#233;tait d&#233;roul&#233;e conform&#233;ment aux r&#232;gles de proc&#233;dure en 
vigueur et dans le plein respect des garanties de la d&#233;fense, malgr&#233; les agissements de 
certains avocats qui ont voulu provoquer les conditions d&#8217;un &#171; proc&#232;s in&#233;quitable &#187;. En 
outre, le Gouvernement a soulign&#233; que ledit d&#233;tenu a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; depuis son incarc&#233;ration de 
toutes les garanties l&#233;gales, dont notamment les droits &#224; &#234;tre soumis &#224; un examen m&#233;dical 
et &#224; recevoir la visite de ses proches. Quant &#224; l&#8217;all&#233;gation relative &#224; une &#233;ventuelle parution 
de certains avocats de M. Abbou devant le conseil de discipline, il est &#224; noter que le 
pouvoir disciplinaire les concernant appartient au Conseil national de l&#8217;ordre des avocats 
qui examine, en toute ind&#233;pendance, toutes les plaintes et les demandes en la mati&#232;re. 
 
364. S&#8217;agissant de M. Faouzi Ben Mrad, le Gouvernement tunisien pr&#233;cise que, lors de 
sa plaidoirie devant la Chambre correctionnelle du Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de 
Grombalia dans une affaire de d&#233;t&#233;rioration et dommages caus&#233;s &#224; la propri&#233;t&#233; d&#8217;autrui, M. 
Ben Mrad a tenu des propos blessant &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard de l&#8217;accus&#233;. Il fut alors interrompu par 
l&#8217;avocat de l&#8217;accus&#233; qui lui a demand&#233; de s&#8217;abstenir d&#8217;utiliser ce genre de propos 
diffamatoires &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard de son client. Essayant de mettre fin &#224; cette situation, la cour est 
intervenue pour permettre &#224; M. Ben Mrad de continuer sa plaidoirie ; c&#8217;est alors 
que l&#8217;avocat en question s&#8217;adressa au pr&#233;sident de l&#8217;audience et lui a intim&#233;, &#224; haute voix, 
l&#8217;ordre de se taire en lui disant express&#233;ment &#171; lorsque je parle tout le monde se tait et toi 
aussi tu te tais &#187; en mettent le doigt sur ses l&#232;vres. Face &#224; ce comportement, l&#8217;audience a &#233;t&#233; 
lev&#233;e et le parquet a d&#233;cid&#233; de d&#233;f&#233;rer l&#8217;avocat pour outrage &#224; magistrat. Apr&#232;s que  l&#8217;ordre 
des avocats a &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;, comme le pr&#233;voit la loi, M. Ben Mrad a comparu le m&#234;me jour 
devant la Chambre correctionnelle autrement compos&#233;e, conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 46 de la 
loi r&#233;glementant la profession d&#8217;avocat. Il a reconnu les faits qui lui sont reproch&#233;s en 
r&#233;futant toute intention d&#233;lictuelle de sa part. Le Gouvernement signale que le pr&#233;venu a 
&#233;t&#233; assist&#233; par un grand nombre de ses coll&#232;gues et apr&#232;s d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;, le tribunal l&#8217;a condamn&#233;, 
en premi&#232;re instance, &#224; quatre mois d&#8217;emprisonnement pour outrage &#224; magistrat fait par 
parole et gestes. Interjetant appel devant la Cour d&#8217;appel de Nabeul, celle-ci a confirm&#233; la 
culpabilit&#233; de l&#8217;avocat, mais a r&#233;duit sa peine &#224; la dur&#233;e d&#8217;emprisonnement d&#233;j&#224; ex&#233;cut&#233;, 
soit vingt-sept jours, et a prononc&#233; sa mise en libert&#233; imm&#233;diate.  
</p>
<p> 
365. Le 24 juillet 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation conjointe 
envoy&#233;e le 3 avril 2006 indiquant que Mohamed Abbou, connu pour son comportement 
provocateur, agressif et manipulateur, s'est rendu coupable de voies de fait sur la personne 
d'une de ses consoeurs et de diffamation des autorit&#233;s judiciaires tunisiennes qu'il est cens&#233; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 199 
</p>
<p>sous serment d&#233;ontologique respecter en toute circonstance. Pendant son proc&#232;s, il aurait 
orchestr&#233; avec la complicit&#233; de quelques uns de ses coll&#232;gues, une campagne pour faire 
croire &#224; un proc&#232;s in&#233;quitable. Le Gouvernement ajout&#233; que M. Abbou continuerait ses 
manoeuvres trompeuses pendant sa d&#233;tention, en v&#233;hiculant, dans le cadre d'une campagne 
de d&#233;nigrement et de manipulation, des pr&#233;tentions ayant pour objectif de faire pression sur 
les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes qui s'attachent &#224; appliquer la loi sans exc&#232;s ni laxisme. Le 
Gouvernement estime que M. Abbou est coupable d'actes irr&#233;futables dont la preuve n'a 
jamais &#233;t&#233; mise en cause et qui entrent sous le coup du droit p&#233;nal. Il affirme que tout le 
long de son proc&#232;s, M. Abbou a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de toutes les garanties d'un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable, et a 
&#233;t&#233; d&#233;fendu par plusieurs avocats et a us&#233; de son droit &#224; interjeter appel et &#224; se pourvoir en 
cassation. Depuis son incarc&#233;ration en vertu d'un jugement d&#233;finitif et ex&#233;cutif, 
sanctionnant des infractions de droit commun et rendu apr&#232;s &#233;puisement des toutes les 
voies de recours disponibles, M. Abbou b&#233;n&#233;ficie &#224; l'instar de tous les autres d&#233;tenus de 
toutes les garanties d'un traitement humain et conforme &#224; la l&#233;gislation en vigueur, dont 
notamment les droits &#224; &#234;tre soumis &#224; un examen m&#233;dical chaque fois que cela est 
n&#233;cessaire, &#224; s'entretenir avec ses avocats et &#224; recevoir la visite de ses proches. S&#8217;agissant 
de l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux soins m&#233;dicaux, M. Abbou a eu droit, d&#232;s son incarc&#233;ration &#224; un examen 
m&#233;dical g&#233;n&#233;ral  et a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de visites et de soins m&#233;dicaux chaque fois que cela s&#8217;est 
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; n&#233;cessaire. Son &#233;tat de sant&#233; serait tout &#224; fait normal et ne pr&#233;senterait aucun danger 
pour sa vie ou son int&#233;grit&#233; physique. Pour ce qui est du droit de visite, il aurait re&#231;u plus de 
60 visites de la part de son &#233;pouse, de ses enfants, de sa m&#232;re et de son oncle. Il aurait 
m&#234;me &#233;t&#233; autoris&#233; &#224; recevoir ses enfants &#224; plusieurs reprises sans aucun obstacle. Une 
quinzaine de ses avocats lui auraient &#233;galement rendu visite &#224; vingt reprises. Le juge 
d&#8217;application des peines l&#8217;aurait &#233;galement visit&#233; les 3 janvier 2006 et 8 mai 2006 ainsi que 
la d&#233;l&#233;gation du CICR qui l&#8217;aurait rencontr&#233; lors d&#8217;une visite &#224; la prison civile du Kef le 14 
f&#233;vrier 2006. Le Gouvernement nie le fait que M. Abbou ferait l&#8217;objet de vexation de la 
part des gardiens et de certains d&#233;tenus. Il a ajout&#233; que la qualit&#233; d&#8217;avocat de M. Abbou ne 
pouvait aucunement lui conf&#233;rer un traitement de faveur qui serait incompatible avec les 
dispositions de la loi n 52-2001 en date du 14 mai 2001, portant organisation des prisons, 
qui r&#233;git le traitement des personnes priv&#233;es provisoirement de leur libert&#233;. Le 
Gouvernement a &#233;galement indiqu&#233; que la Tunisie a adopt&#233; les normes internationales, 
harmonis&#233; sa l&#233;gislation interne avec les instruments de protection des droits de l&#8217;homme 
et modernis&#233; son appareil judiciaire, et s&#8217;est engag&#233;e de mani&#232;re irr&#233;versible sur la voie de 
la promotion et de la protection des droits de l&#8217;homme dans le cadre de l&#8217;&#233;tat de droit, sans 
exception, ni discrimination. En ce qui concerne les conditions de d&#233;tention des personnes 
priv&#233;es provisoirement de leur libert&#233;, depuis le 4 novembre 1988, la Tunisie s&#8217;est dot&#233;e 
d&#8217;un d&#233;cret portant organisation des prisons et n&#8217;a cess&#233; d&#8217;&#339;uvrer pour l&#8217;am&#233;lioration des 
conditions de d&#233;tention en prenant diverses mesures organiques et fonctionnelles dont 
l&#8217;adoption de la d&#233;finition de la torture telle que formul&#233;e dans la Convention contre la 
torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains et d&#233;gradantset ce en vertu de la loi 
n 89 du 2 ao&#251;t 1999 portant amendement du Code p&#233;nal ; l&#8217;institution du syst&#232;me de

Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders concerning Ms. Eren Keskin, a lawyer who works with the project 
&#8220;Legal Aid for Women Raped or Sexually Assaulted by State Security Forces&#8221; in Turkey. 
This project provides legal assistance to victims of sexual violence and is funded by the

</p>
<p>urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation 
of human rights defenders on 22 April 2005. According to the information received, on 14 
March 2006 Eren Keskin was sentenced to 10 months&#8217; imprisonment by the Kartal 3rd 
Court of First Instance. The sentence was converted into a fine of 6,000 liras. It is reported 
that Ms. Keskin has refused to pay the fine. The sentencing results from charges brought 
against Ms. Keskin of insulting the Armed Forces. The charges were brought against Ms. 
Keskin after she gave a speech at a meeting in Cologne, Germany, in 2002 about cases of 
sexual violence against women inmates by the Turkish State Security Forces. It is reported 
that Ms. Keskin has appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal. Concern is expressed 
that the decision is connected with Ms. Keskin &#8216;s activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular the rights of women who have been the victims of sexual violence.

371. On 11 January 2006, the Government replied to the joint allegation letter sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on 31 August 2005 concerning the Tunceli Bar Association. The 
Government reported that upon the filing of the complaint by the Tunceli Bar Association 
against the officers at the Gendarmerie Command, the Office of the Chief Public 
Prosecutor submitted a request to the Governor&#8217;s Office for permission to conduct a 
preliminary inquiry into the case. The Governor, after reviewing the case, decided not to 
grant permission to conduct an investigation for all the suspects; therefore, no such 
investigation was initiated. 
 
372. On 30 May 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 5 April 2006, acknowledging that the summary of the case 
contained in the letter of the Special Rapporteur was correct:  Ms. Eren Keskin was 
sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment by the Kartal 3rd Court of First instance on the 
charge of insulting the Armed Forces, and this sentence was converted into a fine of 6,000 
liras. The Government confirmed that Ms. Keskin has lodged an appeal against this 
decision with the Supreme Court of Appeals, but stated that since the court proceeding was 
under way, it was impossible to comment further on the case at this stage.

375. On 13 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> 
</b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
regarding Sultan Salem Sultan Bunawwas, Magid Muhammad Khalifa al-Mazru`I, Salih 
Muhammad Hussein Ahmad, Salah Yusif Hamza al-Asmakh, Shihab Muhammad 
Abdullah al-Mihirbi, Ahmad Muhammad Thani al-Mazru`I, Khalid Jamal Ali al-Manna`I, 
Abd al-Basit `Ubaid Mubarak, Nawwaf Hassan Sa`id al-Khamairi, Ahmad Rashid 
Abdullah al-Naqbi, Gum`a Khadim al-Muhairi and Ahmad Hamid Ali al-Marri, who were 
found guilty of homosexuality and obscenity. According to the information received, on 22 
November 2005, police raided a villa in Ghantout and arrested 26 men who were gathering 
there.  The police apparently acted in response to allegations that homosexual conduct was 
taking place and that some of the men were wearing women&#8217;s garments or make-up.  It is 
reported that during the raid, police punched, kicked and beat some of the men.  A few days 
after their arrest, a government official alleged that members of the group would be given 
male hormone injections, though this claim was later denied by another government 
spokesperson. Police allegedly beat the men again when they were in custody with the aim 
of forcing them to confess their homosexual conduct. It is also reported that some members 
of the group were subjected to invasive forensic examinations in an effort to prove their 
homosexuality.  In a trial in February 2006, 12 of the 26 men, including almost all of those 
who were subjected to invasive bodily examinations, were sentenced to six years&#8217; 
imprisonment on charges relating to homosexuality and obscenity, while a thirteenth man 
received a lighter sentence. Their case is now pending appeal, which should take place on 
14 March 2006. The other 13 men arrested were reportedly prosecuted and acquitted. It is 
the understanding of the Special Rapporteurs that the law of the United Arab Emirates 
stipulates that a person can only be found guilty of homosexuality if four witnesses 
unanimously agree that they saw the act or if one of the participants confesses. In this case, 
it is reported that no witnesses testified against the defendants and that there was no other 
indication that any of them had engaged in homosexual conduct together. On the other 
hand, according to the information received, the alleged confessions presented as evidence 
were extracted under invasive forensic examinations which could amount to torture and 
could therefore not be used as an evidence for a conviction.

376. On 8 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with<b> </b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders concerning Mohamed al-Mansoori, a lawyer,  human rights 
activist and President of the Independent Jurist&#8217;s Association, and Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah 
al-Roken, a lawyer,  human rights activist and former President of the Emirates&#8217; Jurists&#8217; 
Association. According to the allegations received, on 17 June 2006, an arrest warrant was 
issued against Mohamed al-Mansoori, based on an accusation of &#8220;insulting the 
Prosecutor&#8221;. It is alleged that the real motive of this order was to silence Mr. al-Mansoori 
after he gave several interviews on Arab satellite television in which he criticized the 
human rights situation in the country. On 23 August 2006, Mohamed&#8217; Abdullah al-Roken </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 203 
</p>
<p>was reportedly arrested by members of the State Security, Amn al-Dawla.  The reasons for 
his detention remain unknown. Previously, Mr. al-Roken was arrested and held for one 
night in July 2006, after he gave an interview regarding the recent conflict in Lebanon on 
an Arabic television station. It is also alleged that both Mr. al-Mansoori and Mr. al-Roken 
have been banned for a number of years from giving interviews or writing articles for the 
media. In addition, in September 2005, the authorities of the Emirate of Fujairah allegedly 
banned a conference on civil rights, women&#8217;s rights and democracy organized by the 
Jurists&#8217; Association, without giving any reasons. Serious concerns have been expressed 
that Mr. al-Mansoori and Mr. al-Roken may be detained on account of their peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights, and that their detention may form part of a campaign 
of harassment and intimidation against defenders of human rights in the United Arab 
Emirates.

Manmohan Sandhu, a lawyer practising in Northern Ireland. According to the information 
received, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) conducted covert surveillance of 
Manmohan Sandhu&#8217;s consultations with his clients at the Serious Crimes Suite in Antrim, 
over a period of time. On 31 January, Manmohan Sandhu was arrested, based solely on the 
information the PSNI obtained by recordings of the solicitor&#8217;s confidential conversations 
with his clients in a solicitor&#8217;s consultation room at the Serious Crimes Suite in Antrim 
police station. Manmohan Sandhu faces four charges of perverting the course of justice.  
On 7 February, he was granted bail in the High Court. It is alleged that other lawyers&#8217; 
consultations with their clients which were said to have no connection with Mr Sandhu 
may also have been recorded.

<p><b> 
</b>380. On 15 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding 
the new Constitution for Gibraltar, in  which he brought to the Government&#8217;s attention the 
following points: 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 204 
</p>
<p>  - The Special Rapporteur expressed concen that Constitution might fail to 
guarantee the independence of the judiciary in Gibraltar. According to the information 
received, the principle of the independence of the judiciary is not enshrined in the 
Constitution, a lack that is incompatible with a democratic system founded on the 
separation of powers and with the international obligations subscribed to by the 
Government on the need to guarantee the independence of the judiciary. He urged the 
Government to make sure that this fundamental principle is included in the new 
Constitution. Also, various provisions of the new Constitution weaken the independence of 
the judiciary. Concerning the appointment of judges, the Special Rapporteur noted with 
satisfaction that the Constitution provides for the creation of a Judicial Service 
Commission. However, he expressed concern at the role of the executive in the judicial 
appointment process. In particular, an imbalance appears between judicial and executive 
appointees in article 57 (1) which provides that the Judicial Service Commission of 
Gibraltar shall consist of the President of the Court of Appeal, who shall be the Chair, the 
Chief Justice, the Stipendiary Magistrate, two members appointed by the Governor, acting 
in accordance with the advice of the Chief Minister, and two members appointed by the 
Governor, acting at his discretion. The Special Rapporteur noted with deep concern the fact 
that executive appointees have the majority; the lack of criteria for the selection of the 
non-judicial appointments by the Governor; and the lack of a provision on the length of 
service of the members of the Commission. In addition, section 58 provides that votes of 
the Judicial Service Commission can be taken in the absence of some of its members.  
Furthermore, section 57 2) b fails to give proper protection to junior members of the 
judiciary in terms of tenure of office. According to this provision, the Governor, acting in 
accordance with the advice of the Judicial Service Commission, may terminate the 
appointments of the Stipendiary Magistrate, Justices of the Peace and the Registrar of the 
Supreme Court. The Special Rapporteur underlined that security of tenure is fundamental 
to the independence of the judiciary and that this applies to all levels of the judiciary, 
including the Stipendiary Magistrate, Justices of the Peace and the Registrar. Moreover, the 
termination of any appointment and control over disciplinary matters should lie solely with 
the judiciary. He also expressed concern at the lack of transparent, objectively justified 
criteria by which the power of removal may be exercised;  
 
 - He is also deeply concerned at section 64 (7), which allows the appointment of a 
Chief Justice or Puisne Judge for a specified term only:  &#8220;A person may be appointed to the 
office of Chief Justice or of Puisne Judge for such term as may be specified in the 
instrument of his appointment, and the office of a person so appointed shall become vacant 
on the day on which the specified term expires&#8221;.  He fears that this article may undermine 
the security of tenure of these persons, guaranteed by section 64 (1) of the Constitution 
which provides for security of tenure for the Chief Justice and Supreme Court Judges until 
the age of 67. He has been informed that this provision has been justified by the need to 
replace a judge who for any reason would be unable to perform the functions of his/her 
office, but  believes that such specific cases are already covered by article 63. Therefore, 
article 64 (7), which is formulated in general terms, appears to threaten the security of 
tenure of these judges. Moreover, section 57 2) c) gives to the Governor, albeit with the 
advice of the Judicial Service Commission, the power to exercise disciplinary control over 
the Stipendiary Magistrate, Justices of the Peace and the Registrar. Finally, section 57 3) </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 205 
</p>
<p>permits the Governor, acting with the prior approval of the Secretary of State, to disregard 
the advice of the Judicial Service Commission to the executive on appointments, 
terminations and discipline if compliance with that advice would prejudice Her Majesty&#8217;s 
service. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned  that under this article the Governor 
would be able to control the appointments, terminations and disciplinary actions of judges 
and therefore exercise an undue influence on them. In addition, the Constitution does not 
limit the exercise of this control to very specific or exceptional circumstances. Finally, he 
expressed concern at the fact that the observations submitted by the Gibraltar judiciary on 
the draft Constitution may not have been duly taken into consideration;  
 
 - The Special Rapporteur stressed that while he does not wish to prejudge the 
accuracy of these allegations, he nevertheless wished to draw the attention of the 
Government to the fact that the failure of the Constitution to recognize the independence of 
the judiciary and the provisions of the Constitution that enable the executive branch to 
exercise influence over the judiciary appear to be incompatible with the international 
obligations subscribed to by the Government to guarantee the independence of the 
judiciary, in particular under article 14 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. They also appear to be incompatible with the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary. In this context, the Special Rapporteur invited the 
Government to transmit his concerns to Her Majesty in Council, in view of the adoption of 
the Constitution before the Council's meeting on 14 December 2006, and urged the Council 
to address the serious concerns mentioned in his.  
<b> 
Communications received 
 
</b>381. On 3 April 2006, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on 1 March 2006. The Government stated that all cover investigations carried 
out in Northern Ireland are governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 
(RIPA) and the Police Act 1997 Part III. The Police Act Part III deals with interference 
with property and does not apply in this case because the property concerned was in the 
ownership and under the control of the police force concerned. A prima facie case must 
exist before the police engage in any type of covert operation. The principles to be 
followed are fully set out in the legislation and the Codes of Conduct and must be adhered 
to. Before granting an authorization the officer concerned must believe that the 
authorization is necessary for one or more of the purposes set out in RIPA and that the 
action sought is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by carrying it out. The 
authorization specifies the description of the surveillance to be undertaken and describes 
the circumstances in which it is to be carried out and the investigation or operation for the 
purposes of which it is carried out. The law provides that legal professional privilege does 
not afford protection to communications made in pursuance of crime or for criminal 
purposes. If such communications are suspected to be taking place then, in appropriate 
circumstances and subject to proper safeguards, surveillance is lawful, proportionate and 
necessary. The Code of Practice governing RIPA envisages situations in which 
communications would lose legal privilege. Paragraph 3.4 of the Code states : &quot;Legal 
privilege does not apply to communications made with the intention of furthering a 
criminal purpose... Legally privilege communications will lose their protection if there are </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 206 
</p>
<p>grounds to believe, for example that the professional legal adviser is intending to hold or 
use them for a criminal purpose&#8221;. The Government asserted that in this case the 
circumstances were fully considered and that authorization for surveillance was granted in 
accordance with the appropriate principles which included full protection of the 
confidentiality of clients being interviewed by Mr. Sandhu. It added that complaints 
brought under RIPA 2000 or the Police Act 1997 Part III were dealt with by the 
Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The Government stated that it contacted the Tribunal 
which confirmed that it had received no complaint from Mr. Sandhu. The Police 
Ombudsman received a complaint from Mr. Sandhu concerning a subsequent search of his 
home and associated publicity which she is currently investigating and that she has also 
received a complaint from a person who was interviewed by Mr. Sandhu and is also 
investigating that matter. The Government stressed that police action in conducting covert 
surveillance on members of the legal profession is undertaken only in rare and extreme 
circumstances.

</p>
<p>&#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTS ISSUE JOINT REPORT ON SITUATION OF 
DETAINEES IN GUANTANAMO BAY  
</p>
<p> 
&#8220;The following statement was issued today by the Chairman-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Leila Zerrougui; the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy; the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, Manfred Nowak; the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, Asma Jahangirl and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Paul 
Hunt: 
 
&#8221;Five independent investigators of the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights are calling on the United States to close immediately the detention centre in 
Guant&#225;namo Bay and bring all detainees before an independent and competent 
tribunal or release them. 
 
&#8221;The call comes in a report published today following an 18-month joint study by </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 207 
</p>
<p>the experts into the situation of detainees at that United States Naval Base. The 
report's findings are based on information from the United States Government, 
interviews conducted by the experts with former Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees 
currently residing or detained in France, Spain and the United Kingdom and 
responses from lawyers acting on behalf of some current detainees. It also relies on 
information available in the public domain, including reports prepared by 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), information contained in declassified 
official United States documents and media reports. The experts expressed regret 
that the Government did not allow them the opportunity to have free access to 
detainees in Guantanamo Bay and carry out private interviews, as provided by the 
terms of reference accepted by all countries they visit. 
 
&#8221;The five experts &#8211; specializing in issues related to arbitrary detention, freedom of 
religion, the right to health, torture and the independence of judges and lawyers &#8211; 
conclude that the persons held at Guant&#225;namo Bay are entitled to challenge the 
legality of their detention before a judicial body and to obtain release if detention is 
found to lack a proper legal basis. The continuing detention of all persons held at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay amounts to arbitrary detention, they state, adding that &#8211; where 
criminal proceedings are initiated against a detainee &#8211; the executive branch of the 
United States Government operates as judge, prosecutor and defence counsel in 
violation of various guarantees of the right to a fair trial 
 
&#8221;According to the experts, attempts by the United States Administration to redefine 
&#8216;torture&#8217; in the framework of the struggle against terrorism in order to allow certain 
interrogation techniques that would not be permitted under the internationally 
accepted definition of torture are of utmost concern. The confusion with regard to 
authorized and unauthorized interrogation techniques over the last years is 
particularly alarming. The interrogation techniques authorized by the Department 
of Defense, particularly if used simultaneously, amount to degrading treatment. If 
in individual cases, which were described in interviews, the victim experienced 
severe pain or suffering, these acts amounted to torture as defined in article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture. Furthermore, the general conditions of detention, in 
particular the uncertainty about the length of detention and prolonged solitary 
confinement, amount to inhuman treatment and to a violation of the right to health 
as well as a violation of the right of detainees to be treated with humanity and with 
respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. They add that force-feeding of 
competent detainees violates the right to health as well as the ethical duties of any 
health professionals who may be involved.  
 
&#8221;Among their recommendations, the experts say terrorism suspects should be 
detained in accordance with criminal procedure that respects the safeguards 
enshrined in relevant international law. Accordingly, the United States 
Government should either expeditiously bring all Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees to 
trial or release them without further delay. They also call on the Government to 
close down the Guant&#225;namo Bay detention centre and to refrain from any practice 
amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, discrimination on </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 208 
</p>
<p>the basis of religion, and violations of the rights to health and freedom of religion. 
The investigators also request full and unrestricted access to the Guant&#225;namo Bay 
facilities, including private interviews with detainees. Consideration should also be 
given to trying suspected terrorists before a competent international tribunal.  
 
&#8221;<b>Chronology leading up to report</b>  
 
&#8221;The five mandate holders have been following the situation of detainees held at 
the United States Naval Base at Guant&#225;namo Bay since January 2002. In June 2004, 
the Annual Meeting of special rapporteurs/representatives, experts and 
chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures and the advisory services 
programme of the Commission on Human Rights, decided that they should 
continue this task as a group because the situation concerns each of their mandates. 
 
&#8221;In studying the situation, they have continuously sought the cooperation of the 
United States authorities. They sent a number of letters requesting the United States 
Government to allow them to visit Guant&#225;namo Bay in order to gather first hand 
information from the prisoners themselves. By letter dated 28 October 2005, the 
Government of the United States of America extended an invitation for a one-day 
visit to three of the five mandate holders, inviting them &#8216;to visit the Department of 
Defense's detention facilities [of Guant&#225;namo Bay]&#8217;. The invitation stipulated that 
&#8216;the visit will not include private interviews or visits with detainees&#8217;. In their 
response to the Government dated 31 October 2005, the mandate holders accepted 
the invitation, including the short duration of the visit and the fact that only three of 
them were permitted access, and informed the US Government that the visit was to 
be carried out on 6 December 2005. However, they did not accept the exclusion of 
private interviews with detainees, as that would contravene the terms of reference 
for fact-findings missions by special procedures and undermine the purpose of an 
objective and fair assessment of the situation of detainees held in Guant&#225;namo Bay. 
In the absence of assurances from the Government that it would comply with the 
terms of reference, the mandate holders decided on 18 November 2005 to cancel 
the visit.&#8221;

&quot;The simultaneous suicide of three detainees in the Guant&#225;namo military base on

Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir; and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt -- have repeatedly requested, 
without success, that the Government of the United States allow them to interview 
Guant&#225;namo detainees in private, according to the terms of reference applicable to 
all special procedures for their country visits. 
 
&#8221;As they were not allowed to carry out such a visit, the five experts produced a 
report on 27 February 2006 (E/CN.4/2006/120) in which they pointed out the 
arbitrary nature of the detentions; the violation of judicial guarantees and other 
elements of the right to a fair trial; the lack of access to competent and independent 
tribunals established by law; the inhuman and degrading nature of the conditions of 
detention, in various cases amounting to torture; the harmful impact of those 
conditions on the health and life of those persons; and the attacks against the 
religious beliefs and dignity of the detainees. They urged that ill-treatment ceases 
and that detainees be brought before and tried by ordinary tribunals. They also 
insisted upon the importance of allowing the experts unfettered access to the 
detention facilities as well as interviews with detainees in private. Since the 
issuance of the report and pursuant to its main recommendation, the experts have 
repeatedly asked for the immediate closure of the Guant&#225;namo detention facility. 
 
&#8221;Given the three suicides on 10 June, the experts wish to draw particular attention 
to the report's findings concerning the mental health of detainees. The report 
warned that &quot;the treatment of detainees since their arrests, and the conditions of 
their confinement, have had profound effects on the mental health of many of 
them&quot; (paragraph 71). The report also concluded: &quot;The totality of the conditions of 
their confinement at Guantanamo Bay constitute a right to health violation because 
they derive from a breach of duty and have resulted in profound deterioration of the 
mental health of many detainees&quot; (paragraph 92). 
 
&#8221;The suicides of 10 June confirm the relevance of the report's recommendations 
and the urgency for their implementation. Many of the detainees continue to carry 
out a prolonged hunger strike to protest against their conditions of detention, while 
others have attempted to commit suicide.  
 
&#8221;The experts await the judgment of the United States Supreme Court in the 
Hamdan case. A ruling on this matter could have far reaching consequences for the 
protection of human rights in times of emergencies, conflicts and global tension. At 
the same time the experts recall the need for norms of fair trial and access to 
detainees to be ensured in counter-terrorism measures in all instances. 
 
&#8221;In this context, the experts reiterate their request for the immediate closure of the 
Guant&#225;namo detention facility.&#8221;

<p>385. On 6 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release: 
 
&#8220;The Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Leila 
Zerrougui; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
Leandro Despouy; the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak; the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir; and the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical 
and mental health, Paul Hunt, issued the following statement today: 
 
&quot;In our report of 27 February 2006, we recommended that the detention facilities at 
Guantanamo Bay be closed without further delay. Some five months later, the 
facilities continue to hold more than 450 prisoners in breach of international human 
rights law. We take this opportunity to reaffirm the grave concerns and 
recommendations set out in our report.  
 
&#8221;We are encouraged by the recent decision adopted on 29 June 2006 by the United 
States Supreme Court in the case of <i>Hamdan </i>v. <i>Rumsfeld</i>. We are also encouraged 
that an increasing number of highly influential figures and institutions, such as the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations and the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, as well as regional organizations including the European Parliament and the 
European Union Presidency, have called in recent months for the closure of the 
detention centre in Guantanamo Bay. We especially welcome recent indications 
from the highest levels of the United States Government of their wish to close 
Guantanamo Bay as soon as possible. 
 
&#8221;While the United States Government has legal responsibility for the detainees in 
Guantanamo Bay, we urge the international community &#8211; including Member States 
of the United Nations, the United Nations Secretariat and the specialized agencies, 
and the International Committee of the Red Cross &#8211; to collaborate actively, 
constructively and urgently with the United States authorities with a view to 
ensuring that the closure of Guantanamo Bay can indeed take place as soon as 
possible. 
 
&#8221;In particular, we encourage the United States, in consultation with the 
international community, to develop a detailed plan of action, with timeframes, for 
the closure of Guantanamo Bay. As the plan is developed and implemented, due 
regard must be given to all relevant international law.  
 
&#8221;The plan should address a range of issues. Where the United States Government 
decides to press charges against a detainee, it should provide for his transfer to the 
United States and his fair and expeditious trial, in accordance with international law.  
 
&#8221;If not subjected to trial, detainees should be allowed to return to their country of 
citizenship or residence. While doing so, it is critical that the views of the detainees 
are obtained and taken into consideration and, insofar as possible, respected. It is </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 211 
</p>
<p>also of utmost importance that the detainees are not returned to countries where 
they are at risk of torture or other serious human rights violations, such as 
disappearance, summary executions or arbitrary detention, in accordance with the 
principle of non-refoulement. Where such a risk does exist, it cannot be overcome 
by seeking so-called 'diplomatic assurances'. In these cases, we call upon other 
States to assist by accepting Guantanamo Bay detainees for resettlement. 
 
&#8221;Throughout, all detainees and former detainees must be provided with adequate 
health conditions and care, including mental health care. For example, receiving 
States should be willing to make available counselling and rehabilitation services, 
as well as other legal and social support as long as appropriate to former detainees 
and families. The recent tragic reports concerning the simultaneous suicide of three 
detainees in the Guant&#225;namo military base on 10 June 2006 confirm both the 
urgency of closing the detention centre and the importance of providing long-term 
assistance to the detainees.&quot;  
</p>
<p> 
<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
 
</b>386. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned at the situation of the detainees 
held at Guant&#225;namo Bay. He regrets that the recommendations included in the report 
(E/CN.4/2006/120) issued by him jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief have not been implemented by the 
Government of the United States. In particular, the report calls upon the Government of the 
United States to close urgently the Guant&#225;namo Bay detention centre, in light of the serious 
human rights violations that are taking place in those detention facilities and that are 
detailed in the report, and to bring those held in Guant&#225;namo Bay before an independent 
tribunal or release them. In this regard, the Special Rapportuer is seriously concerned about 
the Military Commision Act adopted by the Congress of the United States of America on 
28 September 2006, which deprives Guant&#225;namo detainees of the right to be tried by an 
independent tribunal that affords the fundamental fair trial guarantees required under 
United States and international law. Finally, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government has still not allowed the Special Rapporteurs who have requested a joint visit 
to Guant&#225;namo to undertake that visit under the terms of reference for the visits of special 
rapporteurs. He urges the Government to allow such a visit as a matter of urgency.

</b>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion  and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Saidjahon Zainabitdinov, Chairman of the Andijan </p>

</p>
<p>human rights group Apellatsia (Appeal), an organization working on religious and political 
persecution. Saidjahon Zainabitdinov was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, and the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention on 26 May 2005. According to the information received, it is alleged 
that Saidjahon Zainabitdinov was arrested on 21 May 2005 by the Uzbek authorities after 
he had recounted his version of the events in Andijan on 13 May 2005 to some Western 
media sources. It has been reported that on 4 January 2006 the trial of Saidjahon 
Zainabitdinov began in Chirchik, a town near Tashkent, where he was reportedly charged 
with defamation and anti-Government activities. It is believed that on 12 January Mr. 
Zainabitdinov was found guilty and sentenced to seven years&#8217; imprisonment in what 
appears to have been a closed trial as information about the proceedings did not become 
available until after the fact. It is further alleged that the trial was held at a secret location 
and that no official information concerning the proceedings was made available to relatives 
of Saidjahon Zainabitdinov. Concern is expressed that Saidjahon Zainabitdinov&#8217;s trial may 
be linked to his activities in the defence of human rights, in particular his descriptions of 
the events in Andijan and of the general human rights situation in Uzbekistan, which have 
appeared in the press. 
<b> 
</b>388. On 6 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> 
</b>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders regarding Ms. Mutabar Tadjibayeva, head of the Ut Yuraklar 
human rights organization, an unregistered women&#8217;s rights organization, member of the 
Organization for the Defence of Rights and Freedoms of Uzbek Journalists, the Human 
Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) and the Committee for Freedom of Speech and 
Expression. Ms. Tadjibayeva, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate (part of the initiative &quot;1000 
Women for the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;) was the subject of a communication sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 18 July 2005 and of a communication sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 27 October 2005. 
According to new information received, on 30 January 2006, Uzbek authorities prevented 
people from observing the trial of Ms. Tadjibayeva. It is reported that a Human Rights 
Watch representative (whose name is known to the experts) was stopped at a police 
checkpoint and refused entry to Dustobod when he told the police that his purpose for 
visiting was to observe Ms. Tadjibayeva's trial.  It is alleged that the police stopped each 
car entering the town and asked the occupants what their reasons were for visiting 
Dustobod. It is also alleged that an Uzbek human rights defender (whose name is known to 
the experts) was prevented from entering the courthouse where the trial was taking place. 
Ms. Tadjibayeva is facing 17 charges, including slander, extortion, swindling, tax evasion, 
polluting the environment and violating rules on trade and land use. Her lawyer was 
initially denied access to Ms. Tadjibayeva and when she was able to see her client on 1 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 
Page 213 
</p>
<p>February it was in the presence of four guards. In addition, the defence lawyer was only 
given one day to review and prepare the case for trial. It is further alleged that during the 
trial the judge demonstrated preferential treatment by granting motions in favour of the 
prosecution and denying all applications made by the defence. Concern is expressed that 
access to the proceedings has been denied to the public, including relatives, friends, 
colleagues and independent trial monitors, which may result in Ms. Tadjibayeva being 
denied the right to a fair and transparent hearing.  Further concern is expressed that the 
charges against Ms. Tadjibayeva are a political attempt to discredit her and prevent her 
from carrying out her human rights activities and may be linked to her open criticism of the 
events that occurred in Andijan on 13 May 2005.  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>389. On 30 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter together with<b> 
</b>the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment concerning Azam Formanov and Alisher Karamatov, Chairs of 
the Syr-Darya and Mirzaabad regional branches of the Human Rights Society of 
Uzbekistan. Mr. Formanov and Mr. Karamatov were the subject of an urgent appeal sent 
jointly by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
on 10 May 2006. According to the allegations received, both men were arrested in Gulistan 
in the Syrdaryn region on 29 April 2006 and held in the office of the Gulistan city police 
department. They were transferred to investigation isolator UY 64/SI-13 of the city of 
Havast, near Yangier. During their detention the senior investigator of the Office of the 
Public Prosecutor of the Dzhizak region, K. Mallaev, and the inspector of the Syr-Darya 
Department of Internal Affairs, B. Kodirov, beat them on their legs and heels with 
truncheons, put gas masks with closed air valves on their heads and threw them in the air, 
letting them fall on their backs on the concrete floor. In a trial marred by shortcomings such 
as severely restricted access to case files and extremely limited time to prepare the defence 
for the defenders and their lawyers, they were convicted and sentenced to nine years of 
imprisonment. Concern is expressed that the above-mentioned events may represent an 
attempt to intimidate, punish and prevent the men from carrying out their legitimate human 
rights activities.  
<b> 
</b>390. On 11 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with<b> 
</b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
regarding Ikhtior Khamroev, son of Bakhtior Khamroev, head of the Djizak section of the 
Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, and a student at the Technological University of 
Djizak. According to the information received, Ikhtior Khamroev was arrested on 2 August 
2006 in Dizak by agents of the police. On 23 July 2006, Ikhtior Khamroev was allegedly 
insulted and then severely beaten by a group of young men. Ikhtior Khamroev and his 
parents decided not to complain. The authorities have opened an inquiry against Ikhtior 
Khamroev. He was interrogated for more than eight hours without having access to a 
lawyer. Later, he was charged with &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; under article 277 of the Criminal Code 
(Chapter XX: Crimes against public order) and is facing between five and eight years in </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.1

</p>
<p>prison.  On 8 August 2006, Bakhtior Khamroev was summoned by a police investigator to 
be interrogated as a witness in the case involving his son. It was further reported that on 22 
May 2005, the home of. Bakhtior Khamroev was broken into by a group of 70 people, 
under the orders of the head of the administration of the Djizak region. He and other 
members of his family were beaten, threatened with death and insulted. Concerns is 
expressed that Ikhtior Khamroev&#8217;s detention may be aimed at sanctioning his father&#8217;s 
legitimate human rights activities, in particular his father&#8217;s work monitoring legal 
proceedings and demonstrations concerning the rights of the citizens of Djizak. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b>391. On 15 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Komiljon Usmanov. According to the allegations received, Mr. 
Usmanov disappeared at the beginning of May 2006. With the assistance of human rights 
organizations, his relatives found out that he was detained incommunicado by the Tashkent 
City Department of Internal Affairs (GUVD) for 30 days. During this time, he was 
detained without his relatives being notified, and was under investigation without access to 
a legal counsel. On 6 November, Mr. Usmanov was sentenced to 10 years in prison on 
charges including attempting to overthrow the constitutional system, after a trial marked by 
numerous violations of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan and 
international human rights instruments. In particular, the public prosecutor (assistant to the 
Prosecutor of the Shaikhontahaurski district of Tashkent), Abdulazys Kalandarov, did not 
attend the first phases of the trial. Also, the judge in charge of the case, Abduvokhid 
Sharipov, allegedly performs the dual functions of public prosecutor and judge. During the 
trial the accusations were not confirmed by any fact or evidence in accordance with the 
Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the court did not allow defence 
witnesses to appear, nor did it allow human rights defenders, journalists and many of the 
accused relatives to observe the proceedings. At the first court session, Mr. Usmanov 
rejected the accusations, stating that his confessions had been obtained as a result of torture 
and ill-treatment.  Four witnesses stated that they had witnessed Mr. Usmanov being 
subjected to torture in the GUVD facilities, including being hung from the ceiling by his 
feet and with electric wires attached to his ears. However, the judge refused to order any 
investigation into the allegations of torture. Kamiljon Usmanov and his lawyer, Rukhiddin 
Komilov, intend to appeal the case.

392. On 19 April 2006, the Government replied to a joint urgent appeal sent on 6 
February 2006 concerning the criminal proceedings against Mutabar Tajibaeva. On 6 
March 2006 Ms. Tajibaeva was convicted by the criminal court of Tashkent province 
under articles 165, paragraph 3 (a), 167, paragraph 3 (a), 168, paragraph 2 (b), 184, 
paragraph 2 (b), 189, paragraph 3, 197, 209, paragraph 1, 28, 209, paragraph 2 (a), 216, 
228, paragraph 2 (b), 228, paragraph 3, 229 and 244-1, paragraph 3 (b), of the Criminal 
Code of Uzbekistan, and sentenced under articles 59 and 61 of the Criminal Code to eight 
years&#8217; deprivation of liberty and stripped of the right to occupy managerial and financially 
responsible posts and to engage in business activity for a period of three years. According 
to the court judgement, Ms. Tajibaeva used the pretext of defending the rights and interests </p>

</p>
<p>of Akhmadullo Abdullaev and Khafizidin Koraboev during investigation and in court to 
extort from them first 100,000 sum (the Uzbek currency), then US$ 900, by means of 
deceit and abuse of their trust, thereby causing particularly extensive losses. With the aim 
of unlawfully taking possession of half the fish bred by T. Mamadaminov, a lessee of the 
company Andizhonbalik, in lake N-7, Ms. Tajibaeva used threats and coercion to make 
him sign a contract transferring his ownership rights to her name. She also demanded that 
Mr. Mamadaminov pay her 5 million sum.  On 6 October 2005 Ms. Tajibaeva obtained 
350,000 sum from Mr. Mamadaminov by extortion.  The next day Ms. Tajibaeva was 
arrested in flagrant delicto by law enforcement officers in the act of receiving 250,000 sum 
from Mr. Mamadaminov. In 2002 Ms. Tajibaeva set up an illegal voluntary association 
called the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221;.  She thereupon used funds received from abroad to 
organize unauthorized demonstrations in front of buildings housing local authorities and 
government bodies in Tashkent and Fergana provinces for the purpose of putting pressure 
on them and their representatives.  During these demonstrations she disseminated 
information that she knew to be false, aimed at provoking panic and destabilization. 
Furthermore, Ms. Tajibaeva did not declare the financial assistance received for organizing 
the activities of the &#8220;Ardent Hearts Club&#8221; to the tax authorities and deliberately evaded 
payment of taxes and other charges to the value of 2,042,900 sum. Ms. Tajibaeva set up a 
multiproduct trading and manufacturing company and used forged documents to obtain a 
loan of 8 million sum from the National Bank in Margilan, which she withdrew in cash and 
diverted for improper use. Ms. Tajibaeva unlawfully used 6.8 hectares of land belonging to 
the Nomuna shirkat farm in the Akhunbabaev district of Fergana province.  This plot of 
land had originally been allocated to the Tursunbai farm, and then to the Bokijon Ota farm.  
Having unlawfully taken possession of this plot of land, Ms. Tajibaeva left it untended, as a 
result of which it became waterlogged, heavily salinated and infested with weeds.  In 
consequence the productivity of this farmland fell and the provisions on land use and 
regulations on soil protection were directly broached.  The Nomuna shirkat farm suffered a 
total financial loss of 1,601,512 sum and the Bokijon Ota farm 8,579,304 sum.  Land tax of 
191,130 sum was deliberately evaded. The criminal prosecution against Ms. Tajibaeva is 
not related to her human rights work.  She has been convicted for perpetrating specific 
criminal acts. This criminal case is currently being prepared for review by the court of 
appeal.

<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
 
</b>393. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uzbekistan for its reply of 19 
April 2006 to the joint urgent appeal sent on 6 February 2006. While the Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8217;s detailed information in response to this urgent 
appeal, he wishes to draw attention to the fact that four of the five joint communications 
sent in 2006 concern individuals having worked as human rights defenders. In this context, 
he reiterates his serious concern about the generally deteriorating human rights situation in 
the country. On the basis of the information received in 2006, he remains concerned 
regarding the conduct of the executive and prosecutorial authorities and the legislative 
framework in relation to the conduct of trials. The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind the 
Government of his repeated requests to visit Uzbekistan and encourages the Government 
to agree to such a visit. He assures the Government that recommendations to be provided as </p>

and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Ali al-Dailami, Executive Director of the Yemeni Organization for 
the Defence of Human Rights and Democratic Freedoms. According to the information 
received, on 9 October 2006 Mr. al-Dailami was arrested at the Sana&#8217;a airport while he was 
heading for Copenhagen in order to participate in a conference organized by the Danish 
Institute for Human Rights about its programme of cooperation with some Yemeni NGOs. 
Mr. al-Dailami remains detained by the political security forces (al-Amn al-Seyasi) at an 
undisclosed location without contact with his family or a lawyer. Considering the alleged 
incommunicado detention at an undisclosed location, the Special Rapporteurs were very 
concerned that Mr. al-Dailami might be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. 
The Special Rapporteurs were further concerned that the arrest of Mr. al-Dailami may be 
connected with his legitimate activities as a human rights defender, and may represent an 
attempt to prevent him from being able to meet and communicate with other international 
human rights defenders.

396. On 4 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions regarding 
Ibrahim Sharaf al-Din who was sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court in 
Yemen on 23 November 2006 after a trial whose proceedings reportedly fell short of 
international fair trial standards. The case is now subject to appeal. If his sentence is upheld 
he will be at risk of execution. According to the information received, Ibrahim Sharaf 
al-Din was among 37 members of the Shi'a Zaidi community charged in connection with 
an alleged &quot;plot to kill the President and senior army and political officers&#8221;. Ibrahim Sharaf 
al-Din was arrested in May 2005 and held incommunicado for several months at 
al-Mabahith al-&#8216;Ama (General Investigation unit) in Sana&#8217;a. It would appear that while 
detained incommunicado, all 37 defendants were interrogated without a lawyer being 
present. During a trial that started in August 2005, lawyers were reported to have been 
prevented from obtaining a copy of the court file, including full interrogation records, to 
enable them to exercise an effective right to defence. Thirty-four of the defendants were 
sentenced to prison terms of up to eight years while two others were acquitted.  </p>

situation affecting Roy Bennett, an ex-parliamentarian who was sentenced by Parliament 
to 15 months&#8217; imprisonment with hard labour on grounds of contempt of Parliament, and 
the existence of quasi-judicial powers for Parliament, acting in first and last instance. 
Accoring to information received, during a parliamentary debate held on 18 May 2004, the 
Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Patrick Chinamasa, reportedly stated 
that Mr. Bennett&#8217;s forefathers were thieves and that what he claimed to be his property, 
Charleswood Farm, was an &#8220;inheritance of stolen wealth accumulated over a century and a 
half&#8221;. The Minister also reportedly said that Mr. Bennett would not be allowed to &#8220;set foot&#8221; 
on Charleswood Farm. In response, Mr. Bennett pushed Mr. Chinamasa, who fell to the 
floor. It is reported that Mr. Bennett himself was kicked by another parliamentarian, but no 
one was hurt in the scuffle. On 20 May 2004, a Committee of Privileges is said to have 
been set up to investigate Mr. Bennett&#8217;s behaviour. The Committee decided unanimously 
that Mr. Bennett was guilty of contempt of Parliament and the majority of its members 
recommended a sentence of 15 months&#8217; imprisonment with hard labour, of which three 
months were to be suspended. Afterwards, the Committee presented its conclusions to the 
Parliament while Mr. Bennett presented apologies to Mr. Chinamasa. In an unprecedented 
decision, the Parliament decided to adopt the recommendations of the Committee, voting 
53 to 42, following party lines,  On 1 November 2004, Mr. Bennett reportedly filed before 
the High Court a claim seeking his release. The Court is said to have answered that it was 
not competent in the case since the Parliament&#8217;s Speaker had issued a certificate of 
privilege in accordance with section 16 of the Privileges, Immunities and Powers of 
Parliament Act, which states that any proceedings have to be immediately stayed upon 
production of the certificate and be deemed to be finally determined. Nevertheless, the 
Court stated that the Parliament&#8217;s faculty to exercise quasi-judicial powers to deprive a 
person of his liberty without due process could be an issue. It is reported that Mr. Bennett 
filed a constitutional complaint against section 16 of the Privileges, Immunities and 
Powers of Parliament Act and that the Supreme Court rejected it. Furthermore, it is alleged 
that several court rulings ordering the vacating of Mr. Bennett&#8217;s farm were not executed </p>

<p>and that the statement by the Minister of Justice to the effect that Mr. Bennett could never 
&#8220;set foot&#8221; on it again goes against these judicial decisions. Finally, it is reported that Mr. 
Bennett was released from prison on 28 June 2005, on the basis of the usual one-third 
remission of sentence for good behaviour. He has reportedly sought political asylum 
abroad.   
 
400. On 7 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together 
with<b> </b>the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences regarding the situation of members of Women of Zimbabwe Arise 
(WOZA) and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA). WOZA, and its subdivision MOZA, is a 
grass-roots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s activism whose 
members have already been the subject of previous communications by the Special 
Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 15 September 2006, 16 February 2006, 
28 June 2005, 20 May 2005, 29 September 2004 and 26 September 2003.  On 31 August 
2005, the Government replied to the communication of 28 June 2005, which concerned 
events similar to those being addressed in the present communication. While the Special 
Rapporteurs welcomed that reply, it does not allay their concerns, as explained below. 
According to the allegations received, on 29 November 2006, more than 60 WOZA 
members and four MOZA members were arrested while marching peacefully through 
central Bulawayo to the government offices at Mhlanhlandlela. The demonstration, 
composed of 200 participants, was to mark the launch of the People&#8217;s Charter and the &#8220;16 
Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&#8221;, an international campaign running until 
Human Rights Day on 10 December, as well as to protest against the Public Order Security 
Act. A large group of riot police officers allegedly assaulted the group with batons, 
forcefully dispersing most of it. Many people &#8211; including a young baby &#8211; were beaten, and 
received medical care at Mpilo Hospital. Forty-one persons were reportedly taken to Drill 
Hall by police officers who subsequently beat them, before releasing them without charge 
on the same day. The other marchers, including WOZA leaders Ms. Jenni Williams and 
Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, were taken to Bulawayo Central Police Station and 36 
members, including six mothers with babies, spent the night there. On 30 November 2006, 
the six mothers with babies were released. As of 1 December 2006, 34 WOZA/MOZA 
members reportedly remained in police custody, beyond the 48-hour limit provided for by 
law. The WOZA and MOZA members, including the six mothers released, were charged 
on 1 December 2006 under two separate sections of the Criminal Law (Codification and 
Reform) Act: chapter 46, section 2 (v) &#8211; &#8220;employing any means whatsoever which are 
likely materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort, convenience, peace or quiet of the 
public, or does any act which is likely create a nuisance or obstruction&#8221; and chapter 37 &#8211; 
&#8221;participating in a public gathering with the intent to cause public disorder, breach of peace 
or bigotry&#8221;. If found guilty, the members could be fined or imprisoned for a period not 
exceeding six months, or both. A lawyer for WOZA was also threatened with arrest for 
&#8220;interfering with the course of justice&#8221; whilst trying to attend to her clients. She only </p>

</p>
<p>managed to see the group on 30 November 2006, in the afternoon, after several hours in 
police custody. Serious concern is expressed that these new arrests of WOZA/MOZA 
members and the charges against them are in connection with their legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights, in particular the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights. 
This concern is reinforced by the fact that this incident took place on 29 November, the 
first International Women Human Rights Defenders Day. Further concern is expressed that 
this new instance of repression against WOZA/MOZA members may form part of a 
campaign of harassment and intimidation against human rights defenders in Zimbabwe.

<p><b>Communications received 
</b> 
401. On 14 December 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on 7 December 2006, with respect to the arrest of 40 members of 
WOZA in Bulawayo for carrying out an illegal demonstration. The Government indicated 
that on 29 November 2006, WOZA members numbering more than 40 were dropped at the 
corner of Herbert Chitepo and 11th Avenue in Bulawayo by a white T35 lorry and a red 
kombi. Neither vehicle had a registration number, but it was noted that a white man was 
driving the lorry while a black man was driving the kombi. Soon after, the women started 
singing, shouting and waving placards and a big banner. They were also distributing flyers 
to passers-by while marching towards Mhlahlandlela Government Complex. On arrival, 
their leader, Jennifer William, addressed them, urging them not to run away [text missing] 
and illegal gathering, they managed to arrest 40, and not 41 members of WOZA. Among 
the arrested was Jennifer Williams. The members of WOZA were taken to Bulawayo 
Central Police Station where they were detained in police cells. They were all charged for 
contravening section 37 (1) (b) of the Criminal Codification Act chapter 9:23, 
&#8220;Participating in gathering with intent to promote public violence, breach of peace or 
bigotry.&#8221; The Government therefore denied that they were released without charges and 
that they were released on the same day. The Government indicated that it has on record 
that they were taken to court on 1 December 2006 when the Public Prosecutor declined to 
place them on remand, advising the police to proceed by way of summons. The 
Government stated that none among the arrested was ever assaulted by the police and there 
is no record of any child having been among those who ran away from the police and were 
never arrested. The police in this case are therefore not answerable for something that 
happened without their knowledge. There is no report of any complaint against the police 
from any member of WOZA who had participated in the illegal demonstration. The 
group&#8217;s lawyer, Perpetua Dube, was allowed to see her clients and at no stage was she ever 
threatened. There is also no record to indicate that she ever made a complaint about the 
alleged threat. 
 
<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b> 
402. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Zimbabwe for its reply of 14 
December 2006 to the joint urgent appeal sent on 7 December 2006. He is, however, 
concerned at the absence of an official reply to his communication of 7 July 2006 and urges 
the Government to provide substantive detailed information at the earliest possible date, 
and preferably before the end of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council.
