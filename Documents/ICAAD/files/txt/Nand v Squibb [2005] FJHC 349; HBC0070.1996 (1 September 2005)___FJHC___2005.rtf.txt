ORAL JUDGMENT OF FINNIGAN J

I heard Formal Proof in this matter on 1 September 2005 and was subsequently informed (30 September 2005) that the recorded transcript of my Oral Judgment is inaudible.

From my notes I am able to record that after hearing the evidence adduced by Counsel for the Plaintiff and perusing the documents put in as evidence I gave judgment for the Plaintiff in liability against the third and fourth Defendants. In quantum of damages I gave judgment for the Plaintiff against the third and fourth Defendants jointly and severally in the sum of $103,548.08 including interest at 6% simple from the dates of the Writ 28 February 1996 until the date of judgment and costs in favour of the Plaintiff assessed at $2,000.00.
