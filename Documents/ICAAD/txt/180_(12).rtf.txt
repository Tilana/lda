The Grounds of Appeal

The Appellant/ Original Claimant's grounds of appeal is as follows: "1. False Invoice # 008833 which dated that parts been purchased on the date before the accident. Purchase date 21-05-12 accident occurred on 25-05-12. So the rest are not correct. For it can be parts for other vehicles.

2. why that he backdated his claim on the day after the accident 26-05-12 when we have settle the case on both 30th-05-12 for us both to repair the vehicle as attached.

3. by inspection of the vehicle we note that the cost of damage will be $800.00 and not the claim amount for EG. Receipt #0998 and Receipt # 63537 which he brought 2 months when supposed to be 1 month.

4 we have already paid the mechanic, Mr Sheik of Farm Road, 9 miles Nasinu the sum of $800.00 on 30th-05-12 and we have lodged a report that he never shows up to repair the vehicle LT2351."

3).     
 The Law

Section 33 of the Small Claims Tribunal Decree 1991 provides that:

"(1) Any party to proceedings before a Tribunal appeal against an order made by the Tribunal under section 15(6) or section 31(2) on the grounds that:

(a) the proceedings were conducted by the Referee in a manner which was unfair to the appellant and prejudicially affected the result of the proceedings; or

(b) the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction."

The scope of appeals from SCT is extremely limited. The appeal only lies where it can be said that either the proceedings were conducted in a manner which was unfair to the appellant and prejudicially affected the result of the proceedings or the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction. There can be no appeal on merits: Sheet Metal and Plumbing (Fiji) Limited v. Deo  HBA 7 of 1999.

4).     
Observations

The primary concern of this Court is whether the appellant has met the threshold set out in section 33(1) (a) and (b) of the "Small Claims Tribunal" Decree. The grounds of Appeal advanced by the Appellant have been reproduced above. 

The Court has carefully examined the Small Claims Tribunal records. This Courts perusal of the records shows that the Referee has fairly determined the claim. The Grounds raised in appeal by the Appellant does not meet the threshold and the Records reveal that the Referee considered all the matters that were before him and that the Appellant admitted liability and agreed to pay the sum claimed in the SCT. 

5.) Conclusion

The appellant has not met the threshold set out in section 33(1) (a) & (b) of the Small Claims Tribunal Decree 1991.

The appeal is dismissed.
