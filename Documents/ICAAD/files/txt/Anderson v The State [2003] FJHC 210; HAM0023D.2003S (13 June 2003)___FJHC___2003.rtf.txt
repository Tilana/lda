IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

MISCELLANEOUS CASE NO: HAM0023 OF 2003S

Between:

HARRY ANDERSON
Applicant

And:

THE STATE
Respondent

Applicant in Person
Mr. A. Ravindra-Singh for State

RULING

This is an application to appeal out of time. The Applicant is now 2 years out of time and offers no good reason for the delay. Nor do I see any merit in the appeal. A 2 year term in total for a total of 14 counts of Larceny and Burglary is not excessive nor wrong in principle.

No good cause is shown to extend the appeal period. Leave is refused.
