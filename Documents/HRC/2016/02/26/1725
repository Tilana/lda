<p> At its 24th meeting, on &#8230; September 2013, the Human Rights Council, recalling 
Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011 and General Assembly resolution 65/281 of 
17 June 2011, in an effort to synchronize schedules for resolutions, mandates and 
presentation of reports by the special procedures, decided to postpone the renewal of the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context to its 
twenty-fifth session, and, for that reason, to extend, on an exceptional basis, the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur until that session.
