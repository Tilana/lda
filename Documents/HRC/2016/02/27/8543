<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report provides information on the implementation of Human Rights

</p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its fifteenth session the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 15/6, entitled 
&#8220;Follow-up to the report of the Committee of independent experts in international 
humanitarian and human rights law established pursuant to Council resolution 13/9&#8221;. In 
paragraph 9 of this resolution the Council requests the High Commissioner to present a 
report on its implementation to the Council at its sixteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted pursuant to this request. It contains information on 
the status of implementation of resolution 15/6 as of 8 December 2010.   
</p>
<p>3. To prepare this report, on 1 November 2010 the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) addressed notes verbales to the Permanent Mission of Israel 
to the United Nations Office and Specialized Institutions in Geneva and to the Permanent 
Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations Office at Geneva. The notes verbales 
requested information on any steps taken or envisaged to be taken by the Government of 
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority respectively, to implement resolution 15/6.   
</p>
<p>4. In the light of the short time frame between the passing of resolution 15/6 on 29 
September 2010 and the deadline for the submission of the present report, the High 
Commissioner intends to provide in due course any relevant updated information, if 
available, with regard to significant developments pertaining to the implementation of the

<p>Distr.: General

<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 15/6 
</b></p>
<p>5. In paragraph 1 of resolution 15/6 the Council requests the Secretary-General to 
follow up on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the 
United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
(A/HRC/12/48), in accordance with Council resolution S-12/1. In paragraph 2 of resolution 
15/6 the Council requests the same from the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>6. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the United 
Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, as of 13 
September 2010, is comprehensively addressed in the report of the Secretary-General   
entitled &#8220;Progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding 
Mission by all concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, in accordance with 
paragraph 3 of section B of Human Rights Council resolution S-12/1&#8221; (A/HRC/15/51). In 
accordance with paragraph 1979 of the Fact-Finding Mission&#8217;s report, OHCHR will give 
attention to the Mission&#8217;s recommendations in its periodic reporting on the occupied 
Palestinian territory to the Human Rights Council. In this regard, it is noted that the High 
Commissioner will submit a periodic report on the human rights situation in the occupied 
Palestinian territory to the Council at its sixteenth session (A/HRC/16/71). The report will 
cover the period of 4 February to 30 November 2010.   
</p>
<p>7. In paragraph 5 of resolution 15/6 the Council urges the Palestinian Independent 
Investigation Commission to complete its investigations in order to cover the allegations 
relating to the occupied Gaza Strip, as contained in the report of the Fact-Finding Mission. 
In paragraph 6 of resolution 15/6 the Council urges Israel to complete investigations in 
conformity with international standards of independence, thoroughness, effectiveness and 
promptness into the serious violations of international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law reported by the Fact-Finding Mission. 
</p>
<p>8. As of the submission of this report, OHCHR has not received or otherwise become 
aware of any information regarding the implementation of either paragraph 5 or 6 of 
resolution 15/6. It is expected that the Committee of independent experts in international 
humanitarian and human rights law established pursuant to Council resolution 13/9, as 
resumed and renewed by resolution 15/6, will report on the implementation of these 
paragraphs to the Council at its sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>9. In paragraph 8 of resolution 15/6 the Human Rights Council decides to renew and 
resume the mandate of the Committee of independent experts, established pursuant to 
Council resolution 13/9, and requests the Committee to submit its report to the Council at 
its sixteenth session.  In the same paragraph the Council also requests the High 
Commissioner to continue to provide the members of the Committee with administrative, 
technical and logistical assistance to enable them to fulfil their mandate promptly and 
efficiently.  
</p>
<p>10. As of the submission of this report, OHCHR has become aware that two members of 
the Committee of independent experts, Christian Tomuschat and Param Cumaraswamy, are 
unable to continue in their capacity under the renewed and resumed mandate. OHCHR has 
also become aware that Justice Mary McGowan Davis is able to continue as a member 
under the renewed and resumed mandate. It is envisaged that the two members who are 
unable to continue will be replaced by two new members, and that the Committee will 
submit its report to the Council at its sixteenth session. Also as of the submission of this 
report, the High Commissioner is establishing a secretariat to provide the members of the 
Committee with all administrative, technical, and logistical assistance required to enable 
them to fulfil their mandate promptly and efficiently.
