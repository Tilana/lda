</b></p>
<p><b>25/&#8230;  Situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the 
Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including Council resolution 22/13 of 21 March 
2013 and Assembly resolution 68/183 of 18 December 2013, and urging the 
implementation of those resolutions,  
</p>
<p><i>Bearing</i> in mind paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p><i>Commending </i>the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea for completing its work in a transparent, impartial and consultative 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>manner,1 despite the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea to reduce access to information by refusing to permit the commission to visit the 
country,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the efforts of the commission of inquiry to ensure the full 
transparency of the inquiry by providing comprehensive information on its work to the 
Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, as well as through the 
invitations to the representative of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to public 
hearings,  
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>regretting</i> the refusal of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea to extend any cooperation to the commission of inquiry and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
including access to the country,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>the significance of first-hand accounts by victims and witnesses who 
delivered testimonies at public hearings and confidential interviews held by the 
commission,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the call made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, in her statement on 18 February 2014, to the international community to use all the 
mechanisms at its disposal to ensure accountability, including referral to the International 
Criminal Court,  
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations in 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea that, in many instances, constitute crime 
against humanity, as well as at the impunity of perpetrators, as described in the report of the 
commission of inquiry,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its serious concern</i> at the refusal of the Government of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to articulate, by the time of the adoption by the Human Rights 
Council of the outcome report of its universal periodic review in March 2010, which 
recommendations enjoyed its support, and regretting the lack of action taken by the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to date to implement the recommendations 
contained in that report,  
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>that the precarious humanitarian situation in the country is exacerbated 
by the failure of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to provide 
humanitarian agencies with free and unimpeded access to all populations in need and by its 
national policy priorities that, among others, prioritize military spending over citizens&#8217; 
access to food,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that it is the responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of its entire population, including by ensuring equal access to 
adequate food, as well as, among others, freedom of religion or belief, freedom of 
expression and freedom of association and assembly,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that particular risk factors affect women, children, persons with 
disabilities and the elderly, and the need to ensure the full enjoyment of all their human 
rights and fundamental freedoms by them against neglect, abuse, exploitation and violence,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of States&#8217; engaging fully and constructively with the 
Human Rights Council, including with the universal periodic review process and with other 
mechanisms of the Council, for the improvement of their situation of human rights,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,1 and reaffirms that the report should be 
transmitted to all relevant bodies of the United Nations and the Secretary-General for 
appropriate action;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest terms</i> the long-standing and ongoing systematic, 
widespread and gross human rights violations and other human rights abuses committed in 
the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and expresses its grave concern at the detailed 
findings made by the commission of inquiry in its report, including:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well 
as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and association, which is enforced 
through an absolute monopoly on information and total control over organized social life, 
as well as arbitrary and unlawful State surveillance that permeates the private lives of all 
citizens;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Discrimination based on the <i>songbun</i> system, which classifies people on the 
basis of State-assigned social class and birth, and also includes consideration of political 
opinions and religion; discrimination against women, including unequal access to 
employment, discriminatory laws and regulations, and violence against women; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Violations of all aspects of the right to freedom of movement, including 
forced assignment to State-designated places of residence and employment, often based on 
the <i>songbun</i> system, and denial of the right to leave one&#8217;s own country;  
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Systematic, widespread and grave violations of the right to food and related 
aspects of the right to life, exacerbated by widespread hunger and malnutrition;  
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Violations of the right to life and acts of extermination, murder, enslavement, 
torture, imprisonment, rape and other grave forms of sexual violence and persecution on 
political, religious and gender grounds in political prison camps and ordinary prisons, and 
the widespread practice of collective punishment with harsh sentences imposed on innocent 
individuals;  
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Systematic abduction, denial of repatriation and subsequent enforced 
disappearance of persons, including those from other countries, on a large scale and as a 
matter of State policy; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
acknowledge the human rights violations in the country and to take immediate steps to end 
all such violations and abuses through, inter alia, the implementation of relevant 
recommendations in the report of the commission of inquiry, including, but not limited to, 
the following steps:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To ensure the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as 
the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and association, including by permitting the 
establishment of independent newspapers and other media; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To end discrimination against citizens, including State-sponsored 
discrimination based on the <i>songbun</i> system, and to take immediate steps to ensure gender 
equality and to protect women from gender-based violence; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure the right to freedom of movement, including the freedom to choose 
one&#8217;s place of residence and employment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To promote equal access to food, including through full transparency 
regarding the provision of humanitarian assistance, so that such assistance is genuinely 
provided to vulnerable persons; </p>


<p>(<i>e</i>) To immediately halt all human right violations relating to prison camps, 
including the practice of forced labour, to dismantle all political prison camps and release 
all political prisoners, and to ensure that justice sector reforms provide protections for a fair 
trial and due process; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To allow all persons who have been abducted or otherwise forcibly 
disappeared, as well as their descendants, to return immediately to their countries of origin; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the commission&#8217;s findings concerning the 
situation of refugees and asylum seekers returned to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, and other citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who have been 
repatriated from abroad and made subject to sanctions, including internment, torture, cruel, 
inhumane and degrading treatment, sexual violence, enforced disappearance or the death 
penalty, and in this regard strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle of 
non-refoulement, to treat humanely those who seek refuge and to ensure unhindered access 
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, with a view to 
protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, and once again urges State parties to 
comply with their obligations under international human rights law as well as the 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto in relation to 
persons from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who are covered by those 
instruments;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Acknowledges and is deeply troubled</i> by the commission&#8217;s finding that the 
body of testimony gathered and the information received provided reasonable grounds to 
believe that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State for 
decades; these crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, 
imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, 
religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced 
disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> that the authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
have failed to prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and other human 
rights violations, and encourages the members of the international community to cooperate 
with accountability efforts and to ensure that these crimes do not remain unpunished; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recommends</i> that the General Assembly submit the report of the commission 
of inquiry to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action in order that 
those responsible for human rights violations, including those that may amount to crimes 
against humanity, are held to account, including through consideration of referral of the 
situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the appropriate international 
criminal justice mechanism, and consideration of the scope for effective targeted sanctions 
against those who appear to be most responsible for crimes against humanity, taking into 
account the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission of inquiry; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the situation of 
human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in accordance with 22/13 for a 
period of one year;  
</p>
<p>9<i>. Calls upon </i>all parties concerned, including United Nations bodies, to 
consider implementation of the recommendations made by the commission of inquiry in its 
report in order to address the dire human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to follow up urgently on the recommendations made by the commission of inquiry 
in its report, and to provide the Special Rapporteur with increased support, including </p>


<p>through the establishment of a field-based structure to strengthen monitoring and 
documentation of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea, to ensure accountability, to enhance engagement and capacity-building with the 
Governments of all States concerned, civil society and other stakeholders, and to maintain 
visibility of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
including through sustained communications, advocacy and outreach initiatives; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Also</i> <i>requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to report on its follow-up 
efforts in the regular annual report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, effective as of the 
sixty-ninth session of the Assembly;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit regular reports to the Human 
Rights Council and to the General Assembly on the implementation of his mandate, 
including on the follow-up efforts made in the implementation of the recommendations of 
the commission of inquiry;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Urges</i> the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
invite and to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur, and to give the Special 
Rapporteur and supporting staff unrestricted access to visit the country, and to provide them 
with all information necessary to enable them to fulfil such a mandate;  
</p>
<p>14. <i>Also urges </i>the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
participate in its universal periodic review in 2014 in a constructive manner, to commence 
an open and inclusive review of the situation of human rights in the country, and to provide 
clear responses to the recommendations presented during the review, without undue delay;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, States, 
regional intergovernmental organizations, interested institutions, independent experts and 
non-governmental organizations to develop constructive dialogue and cooperation with 
special procedure mandate holders, including the Special Rapporteur, and the field-based 
structure of the Office of the High Commissioner;  
</p>
<p>16. <i>Encourages</i> all States who have relations with the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea to use their influence to encourage it to take immediate steps to end all 
human rights violations, including by closing political prison camps and undertaking 
profound institutional reforms;  
</p>
<p>17. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all 
assistance and adequate staffing necessary to carry out his/her mandate effectively and to 
ensure that the mandate holder receives the support of the Office of the High 
Commissioner;  
</p>
<p>18. <i>Decides</i> to transmit all reports of the Special Rapporteur to all relevant bodies 
of the United Nations and to the Secretary-General for appropriate action.  
</p>
<p>    </p>
