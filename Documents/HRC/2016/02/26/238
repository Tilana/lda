<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
</p>
<p>Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to Haiti from 29 June to 5 July 2014, at the 
</p>
<p>invitation of the Government and pursuant to his mandate under resolution 23/8 of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council. The objective of the visit was to examine the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the country following the earthquake that 
</p>
<p>hit Haiti on 12 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur called for a transition from a largely humanitarian approach 
</p>
<p>to a development rights-based approach, and for durable solutions for the IDPs along with 
</p>
<p>the vulnerable segments of the population. A durable solution is achieved when IDPs no 
</p>
<p>longer have specific assistance or protection needs linked to their displacement and can 
</p>
<p>enjoy their human rights without discrimination resulting from their displacement. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur stressed that the closure of IDP camps, to which the Government of 
</p>
<p>Haiti has given priority, does not mean that durable solutions for them have been found. 
</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles in the search for durable solutions in Haiti remains the 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty from which a large portion of the population suffers and which particularly 
</p>
<p>affects those displaced by the earthquake. He also notes that the absence of a protection-
</p>
<p>sensitive approach to the issue of displacement, the lack of coherent urban planning and of 
</p>
<p>a cadastre, and the instability which remains, in part due to poor rule of law, are major

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate under Human Rights Council resolution 23/8 and at 
</p>
<p>the invitation of the Government of Haiti, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official visit to Haiti from 29 
</p>
<p>June to 5 July 2014. The objective of the visit was to make a full assessment of the human 
</p>
<p>rights of those who had been internally displaced after the earthquake which hit Haiti in 
</p>
<p>January 2010, and to build on the assessment made by the previous mandate holder, who 
</p>
<p>visited Haiti in November 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Adviser to the President; the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice, the Minister Delegate for Human Rights and the Fight against Extreme Poverty; the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of Mission, United Nations 
</p>
<p>Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH); the Interministerial Committee for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights; the Director of the Civil Protection Department; the Unit for Construction of 
</p>
<p>Housing and Public Buildings (UCLBP); and the Direction Nationale de l&#8217;Eau Potable et de 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;Assainissement (DINEPA). During his mission, he also met with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and country teams, the Protection, Camp Coordination and Camp 
</p>
<p>Management Clusters and of civil society representatives. He visited IDP camps and sites 
</p>
<p>and met with IDPs in Port-au-Prince and surrounding area, including Radio Commerce 
</p>
<p>(Cit&#233; Soleil), Maurice Bonnefil, Bill Gates, Carradeux, St. Etienne and the Canaan 
</p>
<p>neighborhood in the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere gratitude to the Government of Haiti 
</p>
<p>for its full cooperation. He is also grateful to all his interlocutors, especially IDPs who 
</p>
<p>kindly shared their experiences and individual perspectives with him. He looks forward to a 
</p>
<p>fruitful and continued dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations contained in the present report. 
</p>
<p>4. The visit was ably coordinated by the Human Rights Section of MINUSTAH. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is grateful for all the logistical, administrative and substantive support 
</p>
<p>he received, which facilitated the conduct of the visit. He would also like to thank the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General for her support and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>country team for their informative briefings and advice. 
</p>
<p>5. The findings of the present report bring to bear a particular focus on the impact of 
</p>
<p>the earthquake on IDPs and the sites they live in, in the metropolitan area of Port-au-
</p>
<p>Prince.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Causes and current situation of internal displacement 
in Haiti  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recent causes of internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>6. As a result of the earthquake that hit Haiti on 12 January 2010, an estimated 105,000 
</p>
<p>houses were destroyed and over 188,000 were badly damaged, causing unprecedented 
</p>
<p>internal displacement. At the peak of the crisis, an estimated 1.5 million IDPs were living in 
</p>
<p>1,555 camps in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and in and around secondary cities to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince includes Port-au-Prince and five other municipalities, 
</p>
<p>including Cit&#233; Soleil, Tabarre and Croix des Bouquets, where Canaan is in part located. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>the south. In addition to IDPs in camps, an estimated 630,000 IDPs went to live with host 
</p>
<p>families in various locations around the country or to neighbouring countries, including the 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic and the United States of America.

</p>
<p>7. An estimated 80 per cent of those who lost their homes had either rented their 
</p>
<p>accommodation or had de facto occupancy rights without formal ownership rights. Others, 
</p>
<p>who might not have lost a home, especially Haitians living in extreme poverty, were 
</p>
<p>affected in less visible ways. As those affected lost their jobs and livelihood opportunities, 
</p>
<p>rent became unaffordable owing to the sudden imbalance in supply and demand, and 
</p>
<p>education and health care became inaccessible as public infrastructure was destroyed. 
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, IDPs without shelter remained in and around their original 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods, which has had significant implications for early recovery, reconstruction 
</p>
<p>and development planning. 
</p>
<p>8. In March 2010, the Government decreed that 7,450 hectares of land to the north of 
</p>
<p>the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince were to be taken by eminent domain and used to 
</p>
<p>relocate victims of the earthquake, to facilitate the decongestion of specific areas of Port-
</p>
<p>au-Prince. International actors began development of two sites in those surrounding and 
</p>
<p>peri-urban areas for the relocation of almost 10,000 IDPs from camps inside Port-au-Prince 
</p>
<p>considered to be at high risk from flooding or other natural hazards. Those sites began as 
</p>
<p>planned tent camps, and, by early 2011, all relocated IDPs had moved into transitional 
</p>
<p>shelters. Around the same time, large-scale population movements began from Port-au-
</p>
<p>Prince and other areas towards the newly appropriated land, with many hoping that it would 
</p>
<p>be an opportunity to be able to own, or at least occupy, available land. Those areas, known 
</p>
<p>as Canaan, Jerusalem, and Onaville, became home to large numbers of informal settlers, of 
</p>
<p>which an unknown number were former residents of Port-au-Prince IDP camps. Some of 
</p>
<p>those IDPs had been evicted from camps; others had probably received assistance such as 
</p>
<p>rental subsidies, and used portions of their subsidies to construct more permanent 
</p>
<p>dwellings.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition, Haiti faces the Caribbean hurricane season (1 June&#8211;30 November), 
</p>
<p>which poses a serious safety hazard for IDPs sheltered only by tarpaulins and tents. Two 
</p>
<p>major hurricanes in 2012 significantly affected recovery efforts and exacerbated existing 
</p>
<p>challenges. Extreme congestion also creates additional fire and public health hazards.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Current situation of internal displacement</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. At the end of 2013, 90 per cent of the population displaced by the earthquake had 
</p>
<p>left camps, mostly as a result of return and relocation programmes implemented by the 
</p>
<p>Government, the United Nations and non-governmental organization (NGO) partners. As of 
</p>
<p>30 June 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the total 
</p>
<p>number of IDPs in camps amounted to 103,565 (28,143 households) in 172 camps/sites. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in the first semester of 2014, a quarter of 
</p>
<p>the camps were reoccupied, and increased in size following the return of at least 78 per cent

</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)-MINUSTAH in their biannual report, available from &#8220;La 
</p>
<p>protection des droits humains des personnes d&#233;plac&#233;es internes en lien avec le s&#233;isme de 2010 
</p>
<p>(Janvier&#8211;Juin 2014)&#8221;, available from http://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/la-protection-des-droits-humains-

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>of IDPs who, after a year of enjoying rental subsidies, were unable to continue paying their 
</p>
<p>rent and therefore decided to return to the camps. He was also concerned at testimonies 
</p>
<p>from IDPs he met during the visit revealing that the neighbourhoods they had settled in 
</p>
<p>would soon be vacated to be rehabilitated. Those IDPs feared being subjected to secondary 
</p>
<p>displacement with no alternative housing and no prior notification. That was the case, for 
</p>
<p>example, of the &#8220;Cit&#233; Administrative&#8221; in central Port-au-Prince. 
</p>
<p>12. The IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix of June 2014 indicates that, since the 
</p>
<p>earthquake, just over 249,747 households left the camps spontaneously; over 69,192 
</p>
<p>households left because they had accessed alternative housing or other assistance; and over 
</p>
<p>14,444 households were forcibly evicted. There was also significant movement into and 
</p>
<p>between camps, primarily for economic reasons, such as lack of livelihood opportunities 
</p>
<p>and inability to pay rent (the great majority of Port-au-Prince residents were renters before 
</p>
<p>the earthquake). Some camps progressively took on features of the surrounding 
</p>
<p>impoverished areas (including informal settlements), and in some cases became 
</p>
<p>indistinguishable from them. In the first half of 2014, 99 camps closed, 95 following 
</p>
<p>payment of rental subsidies to the IDPs concerned; another 3 camps closed further to the 
</p>
<p>spontaneous departure of their residents, and the remaining camp (Camp Kios Pel&#233;) closed 
</p>
<p>at the beginning of May 2014 following the departure of its IDPs, fleeing from criminal 
</p>
<p>gang activities. 
</p>
<p>13. About 75 per cent of IDPs live on private land. Therefore, the risk of forced eviction 
</p>
<p>remains a critical concern as land owners increasingly try to recover their properties. The 
</p>
<p>Government has still to present a plan to effectively address the claims and conflicting 
</p>
<p>rights both of private owners and of the IDPs, who are some of the most vulnerable Haitian 
</p>
<p>citizens.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Framework for the protection and assistance of internally 
displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>14. Immediately after the earthquake, the Government, itself severely affected by the 
</p>
<p>disaster, received unprecedented support from the international community to respond to 
</p>
<p>the crisis. IDPs were grouped in IDP camps, very often only a few metres away from their 
</p>
<p>original homes. Those camps were managed by the agencies within the Camp Coordination 
</p>
<p>and Camp Management (CCCM) cluster.  
</p>
<p><b> A. International response 
</b></p>
<p>15. Under the coordination of the CCCM and Shelter Clusters, housing was provided to 
</p>
<p>IDPs as follows: the provision of T-shelters, i.e. medium-term shelters lasting 3&#8211;5 years 
</p>
<p>(10 years in some cases); Yellow House repairs, i.e. rehabilitation of damaged houses; 
</p>
<p>permanent housing reconstruction, i.e. construction of new houses to replace demolished 
</p>
<p>houses (permanent housing reconstruction in general has been hindered by land tenure 
</p>
<p>issues); and rental support cash grants, i.e. the provision of rental subsidies to allow 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries to rent a property of their choice for a year.4 
</p>
<p>16. Four years after the earthquake, the humanitarian focus has begun to transit to 
</p>
<p>longer-term development engagement with the United Nations country team. As of the end 
</p>
<p>of 2013, OHCHR was tasked by the United Nations Resident Coordinator to be the United 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 The impact of the various housing solutions and whether they can offer long-term solutions for IDPs 
</p>
<p>is developed in a chapter of the report on durable solutions for IDPs (see chapter V. below). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Nations system focal point on the issue. The continuation of clusters in the context of 
</p>
<p>protracted transition was pursued, following the Humanitarian Coordinator&#8217;s decision to 
</p>
<p>extend the life of the cluster system until the end of 2014.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur commends the commitment of IOM in Haiti. At present, 
</p>
<p>IOM leads the CCCM Cluster and is a key actor in IDP camp management. In addition to 
</p>
<p>camp management, IOM has, with the support of donors such as Canada and the European 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO), been extensively engaged in 
</p>
<p>the rental subsidy scheme. It has also engaged in related issues such as camp integration 
</p>
<p>and worked with municipalities and the national police, in coordination with OHCHR and 
</p>
<p>MINUSTAH/the United Nations Police (UNPOL) to prevent forced evictions of IDPs 
</p>
<p>living in camps. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was impressed with the work done by UN-Habitat, which 
</p>
<p>has worked to put its Sustainable Relief and Reconstruction Framework into practice, 
</p>
<p>advocating for recovery solutions from the start, with a development perspective in mind. It 
</p>
<p>stands out as an example of best practice. The strategy prioritized safe return of IDPs to the 
</p>
<p>affected neighborhoods rather than prolonging the existence of temporary camps. UN-
</p>
<p>Habitat has also launched a project &#8220;From Camp Transformation to Urban Revitalization&#8221; 
</p>
<p>aimed at upgrading existing camps with the necessary retrofitting and access to basic 
</p>
<p>services to guarantee durable solutions (CATUR project). The Special Rapporteur considers 
</p>
<p>such projects to be innovative in providing solutions for IDPs who have lived a few years in 
</p>
<p>those camps, have created ties and are therefore reluctant to move elsewhere. UN-Habitat, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, is also supporting the Government in its efforts to adopt a comprehensive housing 
</p>
<p>policy.5  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur observed the commitment of the United Nations country 
</p>
<p>team in developing, with the support of other stakeholders, an integrated strategic plan for 
</p>
<p>the United Nations presence in Haiti from 2013 through 2016. He also commends the 
</p>
<p>efforts made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</p>
<p>(UNHCR), which has a programme aimed at facilitating the provision of documentation for 
</p>
<p>IDPs and supporting the reform of the civil registry to mitigate the risk of statelessness.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur commends the presence and active involvement of 
</p>
<p>development actors such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, 
</p>
<p>which implement programmes that also target IDPs. The World Bank has published a 
</p>
<p>recent assessment of the Rental Support Cash Grant programmes, to learn the lessons from 
</p>
<p>the rental subsidy programmes as applied in Haiti. The Inter-American Development Bank 
</p>
<p>informed the Special Rapporteur of the Bank&#8217;s involvement in incentive projects aimed at 
</p>
<p>inciting IDPs to relocate to the countryside through agricultural projects.  
</p>
<p>21. A number of NGOs, including Catholic Relief Services, M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res 
</p>
<p>(MSF), Handicap International, HelpAge International, CARE, M&#233;decins du Monde, 
</p>
<p>Oxfam and Action contre la Faim (ACF), continue to be active in assessing the basic needs 
</p>
<p>of IDPs remaining in camps and providing them with those essential services (in 
</p>
<p>coordination with DINEPA) despite drastic reductions in international funding and the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s announced intention to shift its attention away from IDP camps.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic response 
</b></p>
<p>22. In Port-au-Prince, most camps, which were supposed to be temporary, were simply 
</p>
<p>built on land owned by private entities/individuals or owned by a particular municipality of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>the capital. As stated above, the Government exercised its powers of eminent domain to 
</p>
<p>make a swath of land north of Port-au-Prince available for the resettlement of earthquake 
</p>
<p>victims. That area was situated in Croix-des-Bouquet and saw a number of informal 
</p>
<p>settlements, the best known being Canaan. The Government&#8217;s initiative raised a number of 
</p>
<p>controversies: the procedure declaring the area public domain and transferring its status as 
</p>
<p>public property was not fully compliant and thus gave rise to claims for compensation or 
</p>
<p>return by a number of private owners;6 the area is located in a seismic zone, between the sea 
</p>
<p>and hills, which makes it vulnerable to disasters; earthquake victims were trained on how to 
</p>
<p>construct their own houses and settled where they wished, without an urban planning 
</p>
<p>strategy. As a result, a full parallel system was set up in Canaan on an ad hoc basis, 
</p>
<p>including private schools, poor drainage systems and ill-equipped health-care facilities, 
</p>
<p>which were outside government control. During his visit to the site, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>observed the rapid informal growth of Canaan. He encourages the Government to take 
</p>
<p>ownership and regain leadership of Canaan and make the site part of an overall urban 
</p>
<p>development planning strategy for Port-au-Prince.  
</p>
<p>23. For many, the earthquake was seen as an opportunity to &#8220;build back better&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>therefore address mistakes from the past: lack of urban governance, institutional 
</p>
<p>weaknesses and a lack of urban planning, inter alia. In 2012, the Government launched a 
</p>
<p>global reconstruction plan of action aimed at solving insecurity of tenure, environmental 
</p>
<p>degradation and improving urban planning. Almost five years after the earthquake, planned 
</p>
<p>reconstruction has yet to happen, in a coherent manner, on the basis of a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>strategy. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted the absence of a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>plan of action to provide all stakeholders, international and national, and IDPs, with a 
</p>
<p>common understanding of the way forward. He noted however that positive steps had been 
</p>
<p>taken in that direction. Those steps are described below.  
</p>
<p>24. The Government has empowered two executive agencies to deal with Housing Law 
</p>
<p>and Property issues. The Inter-ministerial Committee on Land Use Planning took on the 
</p>
<p>development of a cadastre system, working in cooperation with the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Development Bank, mostly in rural areas. The aim of UCLBP is to coordinate and 
</p>
<p>implement public construction and housing policies; encourage private investment for the 
</p>
<p>reconstruction of areas damaged by the earthquake and lead the post-earthquake 
</p>
<p>reconstruction strategy.  
</p>
<p>25. UCLBP launched its 16/6 programme in August 2011. The project envisioned the 
</p>
<p>selection of 16 poor neighbourhoods of Port-au-Prince, which were particularly affected by 
</p>
<p>the earthquake and which the Government would rehabilitate while facilitating the return of 
</p>
<p>IDPs originally from those neighbourhoods. The Government determined that 80 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the IDPs living in the six selected camps came from those 16 neighbourhoods. Upon 
</p>
<p>return, IDPs would either reconstruct or repair their damaged houses or rent a house with 
</p>
<p>the support of the rental subsidies mechanism. Importantly, that mechanism aimed at 
</p>
<p>strengthening tenure security for renters by ensuring that recipients moved into properties 
</p>
<p>that met minimum safety standards, raising awareness of renters&#8217; rights, and by requiring 
</p>
<p>the signing of a formal lease.7 The 16/6 programme also aimed at strengthening a sense of 
</p>
<p>community in neighbourhoods by facilitating the population&#8217;s access to basic services and 
</p>
<p>the creation of job opportunities. Local governance mechanisms were also established.8 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 The procedure for declaring the area public domain seems to have been respected. However, the 
</p>
<p>subsequent steps as a result of which the property should indeed have been transferred from the 
</p>
<p>private landlords to the State (incl. after proper compensation) seems not to have been followed.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Government also launched the Support Programme for the Housing Sector 
</p>
<p>Action Plan with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank with the main 
</p>
<p>objective of helping improve the quality of life of low-income families affected by the 
</p>
<p>earthquake, providing them with housing to meet their essential needs of accommodation 
</p>
<p>and security, and to establish a framework for planned housing development. The 
</p>
<p>Government further provided 500 million gourdes for the &#8220;Kay Pam&#8221; (my house) 
</p>
<p>programme of bank loans for housing. A programme which started in 2011 to build 3,000 
</p>
<p>housing units for earthquake victims is still running.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur is also encouraged by the establishment of sectoral tables on 
</p>
<p>housing and disaster risk reduction, which can certainly improve coordination for national 
</p>
<p>and international funding and programming in those sectors.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Specific rights and issues of concern for internally displaced 
persons 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur makes the case for the need for a comprehensive profiling 
</p>
<p>exercise for the overall displaced population, the location of those IDPs, both in and outside 
</p>
<p>camps, and their specific needs. He considers the absence of such profiling and needs 
</p>
<p>assessment (with disaggregated data) to be a handicap to formulating evidence-based, 
</p>
<p>durable solutions, having regard to the causes and magnitude of internal displacement (i.e. 
</p>
<p>the earthquake and other causes of displacement) and, most importantly, their consequences 
</p>
<p>on the human rights of IDPs. While some stakeholders  such as the Brookings-IOM study 
</p>
<p>supporting the search for durable solutions in Haiti, have attempted to present a snapshot of 
</p>
<p>internal displacement, the Special Rapporteur encourages the idea of a Government-led 
</p>
<p>assessment, supported by international and national stakeholders, aimed at determining the 
</p>
<p>extent to which durable solutions can be found for IDPs in Haiti. An exhaustive assessment 
</p>
<p>of that type would be the first step towards achieving durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>29. At the beginning of 2014, 60.9 per cent of surveyed households displaced by the 
</p>
<p>earthquake reported that their overall living conditions had worsened since the earthquake, 
</p>
<p>compared to 38.9 per cent of households who did not have to leave their homes. Sixty-
</p>
<p>seven (67) per cent of displaced households indicated that they currently lacked the means 
</p>
<p>to provide for their basic needs, compared to 43 per cent of households not displaced.  
</p>
<p>30. While IDPs and the most vulnerable segments of the urban population of Port-au-
</p>
<p>Prince may face many similar challenges, the Special Rapporteur considers that IDPs 
</p>
<p>continue to have specific needs and face specific challenges related to their displacement. 
</p>
<p>They are a consequence of the extensive physical destruction, the large-scale nature of the 
</p>
<p>displacement crisis, the limited accessibility of urban land, and the lack of livelihood 
</p>
<p>opportunities that have affected IDPs and have hindered durable solutions for them. Many 
</p>
<p>of the socio-economic factors underlying exposure to displacement in the first place are 
</p>
<p>factors that also inhibit the durable resolution of displacement. Those challenges have put 
</p>
<p>certain IDPs at high risk of recurrent patterns of forced eviction, homelessness, disaster-
</p>
<p>related displacement, and extreme poverty.9 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>31. Before the earthquake, Haiti was already witnessing a lack of urban planning, lack 
</p>
<p>of a cadastre, inequalities, corruption and weaknesses in the rule of law, and rapid growth 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>in the urban population partly due to rural exodus. The lack of security of tenure in Haiti 
</p>
<p>was exacerbated by the magnitude of the earthquake and the damage caused. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>the poor quality of constructions increased inhabitants&#8217; vulnerability to the earthquake and 
</p>
<p>will continue to make them vulnerable to any cyclical natural hazard (most people in Haiti 
</p>
<p>build their own houses and do not buy them; the quality of the material used depends on 
</p>
<p>each individual&#8217;s resources). The national authorities should be involved to regulate the 
</p>
<p>quality of individually constructed houses and ensure that they meet minimum 
</p>
<p>requirements, including those related to disaster risk preparedness.  
</p>
<p>32. All stakeholders met during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit agreed that there was a 
</p>
<p>lack of cooperation between the actors involved, whether State-driven (at national and 
</p>
<p>municipal levels), non-governmental, humanitarian or development-driven. As a result, 
</p>
<p>urban development is dictated by private/individual initiatives driven either by survival 
</p>
<p>instincts or personal enrichment. Although government officials met during the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s visit assured him that there was a housing policy, the Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>yet to receive a finalized version of that policy. The housing policy is awaited by the 
</p>
<p>bilateral and multilateral development partners of Haiti as a basis for their guidance and 
</p>
<p>engagement with the Government in order to provide the necessary support. It must be 
</p>
<p>shared urgently with humanitarian and development partners.  
</p>
<p>33. While access to housing is a problem for all in Haiti, the Special Rapporteur notes 
</p>
<p>that displaced families are twice as likely as those not displaced to experience a decline in 
</p>
<p>their housing situation, despite their acute needs.  
</p>
<p>34. In the aftermath of the earthquake, humanitarian support concentrated on the 
</p>
<p>provision of shelters to IDPs in camps. The vast majority of camps have now been closed. 
</p>
<p>Those remaining form part of the general picture of a complex urban environment. 
</p>
<p>According to IOM, 75 per cent of IDPs live on private land, whether grouped in IDP camps 
</p>
<p>or housed in private accommodation. As a result, a significant number of those IDPs are 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to some forms of eviction. Evictions have taken place in three main ways: IDPs 
</p>
<p>evicted from IDP camps; IDPs evicted from informal settlements such as Canaan (Port-au-
</p>
<p>Prince metropolitan area); and IDPs evicted as a consequence of the development of 
</p>
<p>infrastructure projects (for instance Mer Frapp&#233;e). Owing to a lack of progress in finding 
</p>
<p>alternative solutions for the camps, many landowners afraid of losing their land have 
</p>
<p>exerted pressure on IDPs to leave. Some have paid IDPs small sums to move but without 
</p>
<p>offering alternative land, effectively shifting the problem elsewhere. Some evictions have 
</p>
<p>been carried out by way of threats and the use of illegal violence, by gangs, and, in some 
</p>
<p>reported cases, by municipal and/or police officers. Senior government officials have 
</p>
<p>reportedly engaged discreetly with private landowners to lessen eviction pressures. The 
</p>
<p>Minister of Justice acknowledged the concern and the message of the Special Rapporteur to 
</p>
<p>halt illegal evictions, citing weak legal procedures and judicial institutions. 
</p>
<p>35. When evictions first emerged as a concern, the United Nations and the Protection 
</p>
<p>Cluster, inter alia, urged the Government to adopt a policy on responding to attempted 
</p>
<p>evictions, by imposing an initial moratorium until a comprehensive plan to relocate the 
</p>
<p>camps was devised. The Government rejected the call for a moratorium, with senior 
</p>
<p>officials arguing that it would not have the power to enforce a moratorium in relation to 
</p>
<p>illegal evictions. Nonetheless, forced evictions were prevented as a result of the Protection 
</p>
<p>Cluster partners&#8217; mediation with landlords; guidance given to the implementing partners on 
</p>
<p>applicable standards and the legal framework; technical advocacy with a judge on due 
</p>
<p>process and international standards on forced evictions; facilitation of increased UNPOL 
</p>
<p>patrolling; or active advocacy with national counterparts including UCLBP, the Minister 
</p>
<p>Delegate for Human Rights and/or the Minister of Justice and Public Security.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur deplores the fact that, according to the information he 
</p>
<p>received following his visit, on 15 July 2014, 146 households were forcibly evicted from a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>settlement called &#8220;Camp Comit&#233; des Jeunes pour le D&#233;veloppement de Ti trou&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(Debussy/Turgeau) based in Port-au-Prince municipality. On 8 August 2014, Camp T&#233;l&#233;co 
</p>
<p>sans fil (Delmas 18) was entirely demolished, forcibly displacing 400 families. At the time 
</p>
<p>of writing, a number of other sites in the municipality of Port-au-Prince were also under 
</p>
<p>threat of forced eviction. The forced evictions occurred after the Government authorities 
</p>
<p>decided to change the eligibility criteria for being considered an IDP. Since the beginning 
</p>
<p>of September 2014, only those who were registered as such in 2010 would fall under the 
</p>
<p>government definition of an IDP and be able to benefit from government relocation 
</p>
<p>programmes such as the rental subsidy scheme. As a result, an estimated 20,000 households 
</p>
<p>may be deprived of their right to a durable solution and, more dramatically, be arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>displaced for a second time. The Special Rapporteur expresses his utmost concern and 
</p>
<p>urges the Government to review its policies to ensure that all those who have been 
</p>
<p>displaced following the earthquake or as a consequence of the earthquake are provided with 
</p>
<p>durable solutions and do not experience secondary displacement within Haiti.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur advises putting legal assistance upfront to secure land 
</p>
<p>tenure. All IDPs should be adequately informed before any decision affecting their housing 
</p>
<p>rights is taken and should participate in such decisions. He encourages civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives he met during his visit, as well as other international and national 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, to advocate for official consultation with IDPs and their participation in 
</p>
<p>seeking to achieve durable solutions.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Employment and livelihood opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>38. In 2012, the general observation was that, despite progress made in rebuilding Haiti, 
</p>
<p>the country&#8217;s reconstruction and development required a sustained effort in moving from 
</p>
<p>emergency assistance to development in order to create new opportunities for the Haitian 
</p>
<p>population. The Special Rapporteur notes that such a transition is yet to happen and must be 
</p>
<p>planned. He notes with satisfaction that inclusive efforts to eliminate extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>bring about development in Haiti to benefit all, including IDPs and the other most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable segments of the population, remain a priority for the Government and 
</p>
<p>development actors.  
</p>
<p>39. The informal sector is still a strong magnet, attracting the majority of the Haitian 
</p>
<p>workforce. Mostly made up of unregulated micro and small businesses, the informal sector 
</p>
<p>pays low salaries and provides precarious working conditions, a reflection of low 
</p>
<p>productivity and &#8220;lack of economies of scales&#8221;, according to experts.10 In the IDP camps 
</p>
<p>visited by the Special Rapporteur, all IDPs spoken to mentioned that their involvement in 
</p>
<p>informal business was their main source of revenue, in addition to the assistance provided 
</p>
<p>by humanitarian actors.  
</p>
<p>40. Whether they had left or were still in camps, some IDPs linked their specific 
</p>
<p>livelihood problems to a loss of productive assets during the earthquake. According to 
</p>
<p>survey data, IDP households were almost four times more likely to report a loss of 
</p>
<p>productive assets than other households (8.1 per cent compared with 2.5 per cent); the 
</p>
<p>majority spoke of the loss as a consequence of the collapse of houses due to the earthquake. 
</p>
<p>In those cases, the destruction of homes directly involved a loss of livelihoods as well.  
</p>
<p>41. Some IDPs point to a problematic relationship between job access and 
</p>
<p>transportation. Those who have been relocated&#8212;now residing away from pre-earthquake 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods&#8212;sometimes lack transportation to city centres in order to work. This IDP-
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>specific concern over transportation was confirmed by the survey results, which found that 
</p>
<p>IDP households (12.5 per cent) were twice as likely as other households (4.5 per cent) to 
</p>
<p>express discontent over their access to transportation.11 To address part of the problem, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur encourages livelihood opportunities and training of IDPs where they are 
</p>
<p>settled, whether in camps or in neighbourhoods. In both cases, those opportunities should 
</p>
<p>be shared with host populations and displacement-affected communities in the 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods with a view to creating cohesion and a sense of community and ownership 
</p>
<p>in the general development of urban areas.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Access for IDPs to basic services, including health 
</b></p>
<p>42. Since 2012 in particular, a continuing decline in access for IDPs in camps to basic 
</p>
<p>services, in the context of the reduction in international humanitarian funding and NGO 
</p>
<p>presence, has further weakened the situation of those IDPs most in need. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur particularly deplores declining support in meeting the remaining needs of IDPs 
</p>
<p>and welcomes the efforts made by government (including DINEPA) and non-government 
</p>
<p>actors to maintain increased cooperation within the Water, Sanitation and Health sector 
</p>
<p>(WASH), which has helped those most in need. Their involvement is all the more important 
</p>
<p>in the light of the efforts made to link protection and WASH issues and strengthen IDP 
</p>
<p>resilience, including through community-based involvement. 
</p>
<p>43. In 2014, the sanitary situation in camps worsened; 43 per cent of IDP camps were 
</p>
<p>reported to have no latrines at all; in camps with latrines, the ratio is 106 persons per 
</p>
<p>latrine; and 25 per cent of IDP camps have no sewage disposal system. None of the IDP 
</p>
<p>camps has garbage/waste management systems and 57 per cent of IDP camps have been 
</p>
<p>built on slopes.12 
</p>
<p>44. The difficulties related to poor access to water and sanitation directly impact 
</p>
<p>hygiene and health conditions in camps, including in relation to the cholera epidemic. Lack 
</p>
<p>of adequate reproductive health care is another aggravating factor, along with an increase in 
</p>
<p>incidents of violence inside households and within the IDP community as a whole.13 Those 
</p>
<p>deplorable conditions and the lack of prospects mentioned by some IDPs met during the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit explain the increase in violence, health deterioration, poor access 
</p>
<p>to education, and impediments to other basic needs of IDPs, especially those of women. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur was alerted to the severe food insecurity which, while 
</p>
<p>having been reduced from 1.5 million people affected in early 2013 to 600,000 by the end 
</p>
<p>of 2013, remains high. A survey jointly organized by IOM/ACF on IDPs living in 
</p>
<p>Carrefour, Port-au-Prince, in March&#8211;April 2014, revealed that those IDPs who had lived for 
</p>
<p>the past four years in IDP camps faced increased social exclusion, isolation and feelings of 
</p>
<p>uncertainty, with limited prospects for the future. The survey also shows that the global 
</p>
<p>malnutrition rate has reached 12.50 per cent among IDPs. In addition, only 3 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>women interviewed by IOM and ACF reported good breastfeeding practices and only 3 per 
</p>
<p>cent of households surveyed by the same NGOs reported adequate hygiene practices.14

</b></p>
<p>46. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur observed the critical health situation of a 
</p>
<p>number of IDPs in the camps he visited.15 There is a lack of health structures for camps, 
</p>
<p>either due to IDPs&#8217; lack of financial resources to access private health care facilities and/or 
</p>
<p>to pay for medicine prescribed in public health centres. However, according to the ACF 
</p>
<p>study, in the event of an emergency, communities organize themselves and financially 
</p>
<p>support the purchase of medicine for, and transportation to, the nearest health facilities. IDP 
</p>
<p>communities were found to have a good knowledge of preventative measures against 
</p>
<p>cholera, which remains an issue despite a decrease in the number of declared cases in the 
</p>
<p>past year, but lacked awareness of other disease prevention measures. For instance, only a 
</p>
<p>quarter of households visited possessed mosquito nets,16 which are useful in preventing the 
</p>
<p>debilitating chikungunya mosquito-borne virus. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the priority given by the IDPs whom he 
</p>
<p>met to the education of their children. In Maurice Bonnefil, the Special Rapporteur met 
</p>
<p>with a young woman who had two children and who spent all she earned to ensure they 
</p>
<p>would have access to a private school outside the IDP camp. According to ACF, in certain 
</p>
<p>camps, children do not go to school owing to their parents&#8217; lack of financial resources or to 
</p>
<p>a lack of available free schools in the vicinity of those camps.17 
</p>
<p><b> D. Registration and documentation 
</b></p>
<p>48. According to the Haitian National Archives, approximately 2 million Haitians need 
</p>
<p>documentation. Since many undocumented Haitians have fled the county, there is a high 
</p>
<p>risk that some of them may become stateless.18 
</p>
<p>49. The humanitarian community has progressively devoted more attention to 
</p>
<p>documentation challenges, strengthening the base for approaching transitional and durable 
</p>
<p>solutions. For example, during the implementation of rental subsidy programmes, 
</p>
<p>stakeholders systematically observed that undocumented families were unable to receive 
</p>
<p>their cash grants from participating banks. &#8220;Provide documentation to IDPs to facilitate 
</p>
<p>socio-economic integration&#8221; has been identified as a goal within the United Nations 2014 
</p>
<p>Haiti Strategic Response Plan. That objective complements government efforts to improve 
</p>
<p>Haitians&#8217; access to personal documentation, including through a programme supported by 
</p>
<p>the Organization of American States (OAS) to modernize the Haitian civil registration 
</p>
<p>system.19 
</p>
<p>50. Surveys show the strong association between displacement and the loss of 
</p>
<p>documentation, with 21.1 per cent of displaced households reporting the loss of documents 
</p>
<p>as a result of the earthquake in comparison with 7.7 per cent of other households.20 Few 
</p>
<p>families within either group have received assistance from the Government to recover lost 
</p>
<p>documents, NGOs or international organizations. Replacement of lost documentation for 
</p>
<p>displaced families was facilitated by efforts such as a UNHCR-funded programme in 2011 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 MSF Belgique noted that the critical health situation is acute even outside camps.

</p>
<p>(ACAT) assisted 10,000 IDPs with their civil documentation needs.21 
</p>
<p>51. The most common problem identified by displaced and non-displaced families 
</p>
<p>resulting from the loss of personal documentation is hindered access to civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights, namely the ability to participate in public affairs and the ability to vote. Few 
</p>
<p>associated their current lack of documentation with problems in establishing property 
</p>
<p>ownership, buying a property or providing proof of rental agreements. That meshes with the 
</p>
<p>view expressed by IDPs, community members, and other stakeholders that community 
</p>
<p>confirmation of tenure status is the primary way to verify property and housing claims. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some actors did raise the concern that incomplete documentation represents 
</p>
<p>an obstacle to increasing access to housing through formal credit or microcredit 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, which is a central component of the Government&#8217;s strategy to improve access 
</p>
<p>to housing.22 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that national legislation has been passed to 
</p>
<p>enable access to birth registration free of charge. He notes however that such legislation has 
</p>
<p>yet to be implemented, and advises implementation of that legislation.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Rule of law and access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>53. Although Government and MINUSTAH reforms have strengthened the Haitian 
</p>
<p>National Police, its institutional capacity still needs to be reinforced. As mentioned by the 
</p>
<p>head of UNPOL, whom the Special Rapporteur met during his visit, the number of police 
</p>
<p>officers trained remains insufficient to meet the rule of law challenges facing Haiti. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the Brookings Institute study, 19.8 per cent of respondents from 
</p>
<p>displaced households do not feel safe in their current places of residence, compared to 13.9 
</p>
<p>per cent of respondents from other households. A significant relationship exists between 
</p>
<p>displacement and reduced access to police and security services, with 31.4 per cent of 
</p>
<p>displaced households indicating that they currently lack access to these services, compared 
</p>

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>visiting the Radio Commerce camp in Cit&#233; Soleil, the Special Rapporteur was told that the 
</p>
<p>municipal board kept changing. Municipal representatives are particularly subject to a 
</p>
<p>number of pressures, including from criminal gangs. Constant changes in authorities 
</p>
<p>adversely impact on a weak rule of law and a sense of insecurity, including in tenure-
</p>
<p>related issues.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Participation in public and political life 
</b></p>
<p>56. The postponement of elections originally scheduled for 2011 has undermined the 
</p>
<p>right to political participation.  
</p>
<p>57. Upon completion of his mission to Haiti, the Special Rapporteur stated that the 
</p>
<p>current election registration exercise should also include IDPs as equal citizens, to ensure 
</p>
<p>they can vote and participate in the public life of the country. That would involve the 
</p>
<p>Government launching a country-wide assessment of the current situation of all IDPs with 
</p>
<p>regard to their personal documentation to ensure that, when elections take place, they are 
</p>
<p>able to vote. The Government should include all IDP camps in its sensitization campaigns 
</p>
<p>to ensure that the people staying there know how to register and how to vote and, if they 
</p>
<p>lack personal documentation such as birth registration or baptism certificates, they are able 
</p>
<p>to obtain them in time, or are exempted from producing them as a condition for voting. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Groups with specific needs 
</b></p>
<p>58. According to the National Police, as communicated by the United Nations Police 
</p>
<p>(UNPOL), violence against women and girls remains a very worrying problem in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>Physical aggression and domestic violence remain the most widespread forms of violence, 
</p>
<p>while rape allegations have doubled in the first half of 2014 compared to the last semester 
</p>
<p>of 2013. According to IOM, 80 per cent of the incidents against women and girls reported 
</p>
<p>in camps in the first half of 2014 took place inside IDP camps, as compared to 70 per cent 
</p>
<p>in the last semester of 2013. In its report on nutritional practices in camps, ACF notes that 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence is directly linked to non-consensual sexual activities in IDP camps. 
</p>
<p>Other issues were raised during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, such as the absence of 
</p>
<p>functioning lighting in some of those camps, which increases the feeling of insecurity and 
</p>
<p>vulnerability of women and girls. The urgent need to establish a systematic collection of 
</p>
<p>data on sexual violence, validated by the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs and other relevant 
</p>
<p>partners has legitimately been raised and should be followed up.25 
</p>
<p>59. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur found that IDP children, including under-
</p>
<p>age mothers, were particularly vulnerable to exploitation as domestic workers in families. 
</p>
<p>NGOs working in camps mentioned the absence of safe houses as a problem that needed to 
</p>
<p>be addressed in the provision of specific protection to such children. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur received a number of concurring testimonies on the 
</p>
<p>particular vulnerability of older persons and persons with disabilities. He commends the 
</p>
<p>support provided by some NGOs such as Handicap International and HelpAge, to the 
</p>
<p>Government and other stakeholders, by making sure that relocation programmes, in 
</p>
<p>particular rental subsidy schemes and reconstruction programmes, took into consideration 
</p>
<p>the specific needs of persons with disabilities and older persons as well.  
</p>
<p>61. The situation of sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex&#8211;
</p>
<p>LGBTI), especially in IDP camps, was also referred to the Special Rapporteur during his 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>visit. Incidents reported included sexual aggressions, physical assault and psychological 
</p>
<p>violence among others.26 Observers have noted a particular lack of access to shelter 
</p>
<p>protection for members of both sexes, and LGBTI individuals, who had suffered sexual and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence (SGBV), and HIV-positive individuals.27 Special protection and 
</p>
<p>provision should be made for those categories of IDPs. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Search for durable solutions for internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment is that conditions are right for Haiti to transit 
</p>
<p>more formally to a development rights-based approach for the achievement of durable 
</p>
<p>solutions for IDPs. Durable solutions are reached only when the needs related to 
</p>
<p>displacement no longer exist, which is a medium-to long-term complex development-led 
</p>
<p>process for all IDPs and not just those living in camps or sites. Therefore, the closure of 
</p>
<p>camps by itself does not mean that durable solutions for IDPs have been found. In addition, 
</p>
<p>although official figures show a decrease in the number of IDPs from 1.5 million after the 
</p>
<p>earthquake to a rough official figure of 100,000 at the time of writing, much more needs to 
</p>
<p>be done for all those displaced if durable solutions are to be achieved in the overall context 
</p>
<p>of developing the country as a whole as well as addressing extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>63. Accessing durable solutions calls for strong leadership by the Government in the 
</p>
<p>resolution of issues related to access to land and property, housing, justice and rule of law, 
</p>
<p>including for women, which are issues that affect IDPs as well as other vulnerable segments 
</p>
<p>of the population in Haiti. The plan of action launched on 13 May 2014 by the Government 
</p>
<p>to reduce the extreme poverty affecting Haiti is an important move forward. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur advocates that the policy must include IDPs as a target population. Internal 
</p>
<p>displacement carries certain risk factors that can be mitigated through the development of 
</p>
<p>such policies.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur adds that, without development through early recovery and 
</p>
<p>diligent reconstruction, a majority of the population will not see their basic social and 
</p>
<p>economic rights fulfilled and will continue to depend on humanitarian assistance 
</p>
<p>indefinitely, although that will not be forthcoming in the present climate. According to the 
</p>
<p>UNDP 2013 report on the Millennium Development Goals for Haiti, development aid in 
</p>
<p>Haiti has increased from 167 million dollars in 1990 to 1.3 billion dollars in 2012, with a 
</p>
<p>peak of 3 billion dollars following the 2010 earthquake.  
</p>
<p>65. In the past, faced with overwhelming humanitarian needs across the capital 
</p>
<p>following the earthquake, many humanitarian actors sought to restrict their responses to 
</p>
<p>camps, where needs were most visible and beneficiaries could be most conveniently 
</p>
<p>reached in accordance with assistance models largely transposed from rural or armed 
</p>
<p>conflict settings. At the time of his visit, in October 2010, the Special Representative on the 
</p>
<p>human rights of IDPs deemed that approach practically and morally unsustainable. Four 
</p>
<p>years later, the Special Rapporteur found that it had indeed become unsustainable, leading 
</p>
<p>to measures to decongest the camps through rental subsidy as a transitional response, and to 
</p>
<p>premature assertions as to the achievement of durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>66. With the majority of IDPs currently still living in their neighbourhoods, opting, as is 
</p>
<p>their right, to return to their old homes is the logical choice for most. Certain

</p>
<p>available from www.unhcr.org/51b6e2b29.html, p. 70. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>neighbourhoods were so badly damaged that they had to be torn down and reconstructed. 
</p>
<p>Using reconstruction to resolve questions of formal ownership and establish a coherent 
</p>
<p>cadaster has been advocated. Some housing rights experts, including from UN Habitat, 
</p>
<p>whom the Special Rapporteur met during his visit, advocated instead for an approach to 
</p>
<p>reconstruction based on community enumeration. That process, which has been initiated in 
</p>
<p>some neighbourhoods, establishes who physically occupied land at the moment of the 
</p>
<p>earthquake by taking individual statements that are then completed and validated by the 
</p>
<p>community, professionals and local authorities to certify ownership or, at least, possession. 
</p>
<p>67. There may be exceptional situations where the choice of return or local integration 
</p>
<p>as durable solutions is restricted because conditions are too unsafe to permit returns or local 
</p>
<p>integration in a specific location. The alternative therefore becomes resettlement elsewhere 
</p>
<p>in the country. Some IDPs met by the Special Rapporteur during his visit clearly indicated 
</p>
<p>their wish or strong desire to settle outside of Port-au-Prince, very often in their home 
</p>
<p>province. However, the lack of livelihood opportunities has always been given as the main 
</p>
<p>obstacle to such a solution. The Special Rapporteur notes that the projects launched by the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Development Bank in rural areas in sectors such as agriculture are 
</p>
<p>examples of projects which could widen IDPs&#8217; prospects of livelihood opportunities and 
</p>
<p>thus increase their chances of reaching durable solutions through settlement elsewhere in 
</p>
<p>the country. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur notes that the official position has been that all camps 
</p>
<p>should be closed sooner or later. As a result, humanitarian organizations, inter alia, have 
</p>
<p>been hesitant to make sustainable investments in the camps that would be costly to reverse. 
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many decision-makers, mindful of how other informal settlements across the 
</p>
<p>capital emerged, have started tacitly acknowledging that some of the unofficial sites in less 
</p>
<p>central locations will become new permanent settlements, even if some of the inhabitants 
</p>
<p>will eventually leave. Variations of that idea have been explored and taken up, from the 
</p>
<p>integration of some camps into communities by the construction of homes (including 
</p>
<p>through the facilitation and provision of technical assistance for self-building), public 
</p>
<p>infrastructure and the provision of livelihood opportunities on site, to the provision of 
</p>
<p>cleared title and &#8220;sites and services&#8221; to supplement displaced families&#8217; own investments in 
</p>
<p>shelters.28 Very often, &#8220;camp integration&#8221; happened spontaneously through the increasing 
</p>
<p>involvement of private actors and other stakeholders and as a consequence of coping 
</p>
<p>mechanisms developed by IDPs themselves who upgraded or extended the shelters they 
</p>
<p>were living in. Such was the case at Radio Commerce (Cit&#233; Soleil), visted by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur during his mission. IDPs have lived there for several years now and do not wish 
</p>
<p>to be relocated. Moving them would amount to secondary displacement for them. The IDPs 
</p>
<p>concerned have also become the &#8220;owners&#8221; of the T-shelters provided, when they were 
</p>
<p>mostly renters before the earthquake. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur considers that camps are a means of enabling IDPs to 
</p>
<p>integrate locally and achieve durable solutions only in cooperation with the Government 
</p>
<p>and the concerned municipalities and if accompanied by proper urban planning (reaching 
</p>
<p>security of tenure), with the full consultation of the IDPs living in those camps as well as 
</p>
<p>the populations from surrounding neighbourhoods. He has witnessed the efforts made by 
</p>
<p>some IOM and UN Habitat, inter alia, to reach that goal. During his mission, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur had the chance to visit the site of Saint Etienne, Port-au-Prince, which will be 
</p>
<p>integrated. The keys to success are tied to the principles of sustainability (economic and 
</p>
<p>social), regeneration (urban upgrading) and resilience. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>70. Reconstruction in the place of origin has not been the only option chosen. As 
</p>
<p>mentioned previously, four different housing/shelter solutions had been opted for following 
</p>
<p>the earthquake: (a) transitional shelters (T-shelters); (b) yellow house repairs; (c) permanent 
</p>
<p>housing reconstruction; and (d) rental support cash grants. During his visit, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur heard complaints from a variety of stakeholders on the negative consequences 
</p>
<p>of having prioritized the provision of T-shelters over more permanent house construction. 
</p>
<p>As already noted by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
</p>
<p>right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context 
</p>
<p>in 2011, T-shelters can become an obstacle to reconstruction since they are installed on 
</p>
<p>terrain which may be the property of others, and which is therefore not necessarily available 
</p>
<p>for reconstruction and, in the Haitian context, which can become &#8220;permanent&#8221; although not 
</p>
<p>secure and sustainable.29  
</p>
<p>71. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that IDP participation in the 
</p>
<p>reconstruction process had been crucially lacking. When discussing the issue with women 
</p>
<p>IDPs met in and outside camp settings, the Special Rapporteur observed their lack of 
</p>
<p>involvement in most decisions affecting them, whether in the areas of health, livelihood or 
</p>
<p>housing. 
</p>
<p>72. Rental subsidies became the housing support intervention that was provided to the 
</p>
<p>second-largest number of IDP households in Haiti (following the provision of T-shelters, 
</p>
<p>the most common internationally supported intervention), and in 2012 became the primary 
</p>
<p>intervention related to displacement. Under this model, IDPs leaving camps were provided 
</p>
<p>with funds intended to cover one year&#8217;s rent. The rental subsidy programme was premised 
</p>
<p>on the recognition that by January 2012, some 78 per cent of IDPs remaining in camps were 
</p>
<p>renters who lacked the funds to pay the obligatory one year of rent up front. IDPs met by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur during his visit confirmed the general assessment made by members 
</p>
<p>of the Protection and CCCM Clusters that, upon completion of the one-year rental subsidy, 
</p>
<p>they were anxious at their probable inability to continue paying such rent after that year. 
</p>
<p>According to an assessment made by UN Habitat in 2013, after one year, 75 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>IDPs interviewed no longer occupied the rental accommodation identified and approved 
</p>
<p>under the subsidy scheme, apparently mainly owing to the fact that the majority had not 
</p>
<p>increased their income capacity in the meantime. It has also been observed that in some 
</p>
<p>parts of the metropolitan area, IDPs are in competition with other vulnerable renters for the 
</p>
<p>available housing stock.  
</p>
<p>73. Besides, it would seem that the technical support strategy to increase the rental 
</p>
<p>housing stock as devised by the UCLBP is insufficiently supported and therefore difficult to 
</p>
<p>implement.30 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur thus reiterates that the rental subsidy policy which aims to 
</p>
<p>help IDPs leave camps and find a place to rent in the neighbourhoods is a transitional 
</p>
<p>measure to decongest the camps. Therefore, in order to be sustainable, this policy must be 
</p>
<p>linked to livelihood and income-generating activities. It should also benefit the entire 
</p>
<p>community in which IDPs are settled, including through enhanced access to basic services. 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 16/6 programme launched by the 
</p>
<p>Government and considers that the programme should be replicated provided it aims at 
</p>
<p>addressing security of tenure, the right to work and the upgrading of the poorest 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods of Port-au-Prince. The Special Rapporteur urges the donor community to 
</p>

</p>
<p> 29 See communication from the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing: &#8220;Communication fond&#233;e sur

</b></p>
<p>shift its attention from short-term solutions to long-term durable solutions benefiting IDPs 
</p>
<p>and the entire community, and support the Government in such endeavours.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its efforts to improve its 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goal achievements through the economic development of the 
</p>
<p>country, by halving extreme poverty rates and promoting an enhanced right to education for 
</p>
<p>all. He calls on the Government, together with the donor community, humanitarian and 
</p>
<p>development actors, and civil society to continue to monitor the impact of internal 
</p>
<p>displacement dynamics on development in Haiti and ensure that all those who have been 
</p>
<p>internally displaced find durable solutions. Progress in Haiti and the enhancement of human 
</p>
<p>rights in the country are possible only if the issue of internal displacement is given enough 
</p>
<p>attention as displacement dynamics impact urban growth in the country and hence 
</p>
<p>economic development in urban centres. The Special Rapporteur therefore encourages 
</p>
<p>concerted action by the Government, concerned municipal authorities, international 
</p>
<p>stakeholders including development actors, and civil society to act jointly towards good 
</p>
<p>governance and community empowerment through a shift towards a rights-based approach 
</p>
<p>to development, an improvement in security of tenure, justice and rule of law, and in 
</p>
<p>employment and access to basic services.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the creation of sectorial platforms and inter-
</p>
<p>ministerial committees to coordinate development activities, but cautions that coordination 
</p>
<p>still needs to become a reality both among line ministries and between the Government and 
</p>
<p>international stakeholders. In addition, sectorial policies in all key areas such as water, 
</p>
<p>sanitation, health, education, employment and agriculture should also extend to IDPs.  
</p>
<p>77. Consultation and participation of IDPs in processes that affect them should also be 
</p>
<p>improved. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to establish mechanisms to ensure 
</p>
<p>IDPs&#8217; consultation and participation in decision-making, especially in the choices to be 
</p>
<p>made between local integration, settlement elsewhere and return. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Almost five years after the earthquake, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts made by the Government with the support of the international community to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address and end internal displacement in Haiti. Despite the reduction in the number 
</b></p>
<p><b>of IDPs in camps and the closing of most of the camps, durable solutions have yet to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be found for most IDPs. He cautions that closing camps does not mean that durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions have been found. Secondary displacement is the more likely consequence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>such measures, which merely results in shifting the problem elsewhere.</b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur reaffirms the primary responsibility of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to work towards development rights-based approaches to alleviating 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty while incorporating durable solutions for IDPs. The long-term issues such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing, land and the land tenure system, the integration of IDPs into local 
</b></p>
<p><b>neighbourhoods (with a focus on housing, livelihood and access to basic services), the 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration of sustainable livelihoods into the rental subsidy scheme for IDPs, as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as securing the most immediate needs related to sanitation and clean and safe water, 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been identified as key priority areas for IDPs and the population at large in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>search for durable solutions. </b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>During his mission, the Special Rapporteur observed that unequal attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>was paid to the above-mentioned aspects. While access to adequate housing is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential component of a durable solution for IDPs, access to such a right does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffice. The Special Rapporteur noted the engagement of the Government with key 
</b></p>
<p><b>donors and development actors such as the World Bank and the Inter-American </b></p>

<p><b>Development Bank to increase livelihood opportunities for IDPs as well as the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable segments of the population. Such efforts still need to be coordinated and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the information shared with other actors such as civil society, humanitarian actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and IDPs themselves for a better achievement of comprehensive solutions.</b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Measures taken to achieve those durable solutions should remain under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>strong leadership of the Government with the support of the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>and civil society; and in consultation with IDPs and their representatives. Informed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2) and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>IASC framework on durable solutions, the Special Rapporteur addresses the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations to:</b> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The Government of Haiti:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Insofar as IDPs in urban settings are often invisible and live among the 
</b></p>
<p><b>urban poor, carry out a country-wide profiling and needs-based assessment to identify 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs and their location and better address their needs. making a fair assessment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>what is required to attain durable solutions and of whether camp closures have led to 
</b></p>
<p><b>durable solutions in some respects; it should include an assessment of measures taken 
</b></p>
<p><b>so far, such as of the impact of the 16/6 programme, other rental subsidy schemes, 
</b></p>
<p><b>camp integration initiatives and any other initiative (including sites and services) 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at reaching durable solutions for IDPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure the full participation of IDPs in all decisions that affect them, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in drafting laws and policies that address durable solutions for them; 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertake broad consultation with communities and neighbourhoods to address their 
</b></p>
<p><b>broader concerns (including protection concerns) with regard to return or local 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration for IDPs, or settlement in another neighbourhood and how such measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>can be best implemented in practice, in cooperation with host communities and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rest of the displacement-affected urban population; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In particular, ensure that a clear housing policy is made publicly 
</b></p>
<p><b>available, includes the participation of all those concerned and is adopted after IDP 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation; that such a policy provides for an action plan on security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p><b>(including the establishment of a cadaster or the like) and a clear procedure for 
</b></p>
<p><b>evictions, based on the law; the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to urgently 
</b></p>
<p><b>halt any forced evictions from camps as well as in informal settlements until such time 
</b></p>
<p><b>as durable solutions are found for all those who have been internally displaced; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) As recommended in his thematic report to the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/69/295, 61 (j)), establish transparent eligibility criteria for the allocation of land 
</b></p>
<p><b>(rental or ownership) for IDPs in urban settings and ensure that, as a right to which 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are entitled, IDPs have equal access to property if their means allow them to do 
</b></p>
<p><b>so. In this regard, take affirmative-</b>action measures for IDPs&#8217; access to land in urban 
</p>
<p><b>areas along with other urban poor facing similar insecurity of tenure; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) As recommended in his thematic report to the general Assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/69/295, 61 (n)), establish integrated planning informed by displacement dynamics. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urban development plans, poverty reduction plans, general urban planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>upgrading, including slum-upgrading, should include internal displacement-specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects and settlements. As a first step in the implementation of that recommendation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish an interministerial committee to work on the urgently needed urban 
</b></p>
<p><b>planning and the integration of IDPs and the urban poor, including in informal 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlements such as Canaan, Jerusalem and Onaville; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) With the support of development actors such as the World Bank, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inter-American Development Bank and the European Union, develop return and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>resettlement incentives with regard to rural areas, accompanied by livelihood schemes 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the development of rural areas as an alternative to urbanization;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that IDPs are included in all development plans agreed between 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government and its development partners, and in all sectoral tables relevant to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the IDP issue; with the support of development actors, develop tools to assess the 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact of development on beneficiaries, including IDPs, and improve follow-up of 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant government programmes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) In line with the recommendations of the Working Group on the UPR 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/HRC/19/19), strengthen the rule of law and good governance and guarantee equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to justice for all, including IDPs, with a view to eradicating impunity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting justice for all in Haiti; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) In view of the cyclical vulnerability of Haiti to natural hazards, put in 
</b></p>
<p><b>place a coordinated disaster risk preparedness plan of action in coordination with 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant international and national stakeholders; the plan of action should be drawn 
</b></p>
<p><b>up in consultation with the local population and, in particular, IDPs, who may face 
</b></p>
<p><b>secondary displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Launch a country-wide registration process aimed at ensuring that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs have access to personal documentation; and in particular for them to be able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercise their rights to vote and to access land; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Strengthen the government response to the remaining humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs of IDPs in and outside camp settings. 
</b></p>
<p>83<b>. The international community, United Nations agencies, other humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>and development actors, as relevant, 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Strengthen cooperation between humanitarian and development actors 
</b></p>
<p>and with national authorities to ensure coherence in the response given to IDPs&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>needs; work jointly towards greater coherence and cooperation in finding durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions for IDPs; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) As recommended in the Special Rapporteur</b>&#8217;<b>s thematic report to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>General Assembly (A/69/295, para. 61 (x)), work more closely and effectively with 
</b></p>
<p><b>municipal authorities, which are often the first point of contact with IDPs and know 
</b></p>
<p><b>best what solutions work in Haiti; and also support government measures towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>finding durable solutions for IDPs through carrying out regular profiling exercises, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in informal settlements with their participation; and undertake a study on 
</b></p>
<p><b>mixed opportunities to reduce the risks facing IDPs in the areas of housing, access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>livelihood and basic services, inter alia;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Strengthen the coordinated response to the remaining humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs of IDPs in and outside camp settings, with regard to, for example, sanitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) In accordance with the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy on United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations support to non-United Nations security forces, United Nations entities must 
</b></p>
<p><b>refrain from supporting non-United Nations security forces where there is a risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the receiving entities committing grave violations of international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as forced evictions, if and when those forced evictions are carried out in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>repeated and systematic fashion, and where the relevant authorities fail to take the 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary corrective or mitigating measures. Similarly, if United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive reliable information that provides substantial grounds to believe that a 
</b></p>
<p><b>recipient of United Nations support is committing grave violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law, the United Nations entity providing that support must intercede 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the relevant authorities with a view to bringing those violations to an end. If, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>despite such intercession, the situation persists, the United Nations entity must 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspend support to the offending parties; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Actively engage and advocate for a harmonization of funding cycles 
</b></p>
<p><b>between humanitarian and development agencies so as to increase the chances of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>smooth transition between the largely humanitarian approach adopted up to now in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Haiti and a more development rights-based approach, needed to achieve durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions and eliminate extreme poverty for all in Haiti.</b>
