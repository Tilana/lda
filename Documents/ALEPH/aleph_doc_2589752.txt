NEWS RELEASE
APACHE CORPORATION ANNOUNCES SECOND-QUARTER 2016
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS
●   Transitioned from full-cost to successful-efforts method of accounting to enhance the comparability of
Apache’s financial results.
●   Placed on production several strong wells in key operating areas including the Permian Basin and North
Sea.
●   Achieved further cost improvements, including a 17-percent year-over-year reduction in lease operating
expenses (LOE), which averaged $7.38 per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe).
●   Successful-efforts-based financial results were:
●   Net loss of $244 million, or $0.65 per share,
●   Adjusted net loss of $99 million, or $0.26 per share, and
●   Net cash from operating activities of $744 million.
●   Results under the full-cost method would have been:
●   Net loss of $601 million, or $1.58 per share,
●   Adjusted earnings of $20 million, or $0.05 per share, and
●   Net cash from operating activities of $781 million.
●   See the Financial and Operational Supplement for an expanded comparison of Apache’s second-quarter
results under the successful-efforts and full-cost methods.
HOUSTON, Aug. 4, 2016 – Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today announced its financial and
operational results for the second quarter of 2016. Effective for the quarter, Apache voluntarily changed its
method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities from full cost to successful
efforts. Accordingly, financial information for prior periods has been recast to reflect the retrospective
application of the successful-efforts method. The Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
June 30, 2016, that will be filed by the company after close of business today, will reflect this accounting
change.
Apache reported a loss of $244 million or $0.65 per diluted common share during the second quarter of
2016. These results include a number of items outside of core earnings that

are typically excluded by the investment community in their published earnings estimates. When adjusted for
these and certain additional items that impact the comparability of results, Apache’s second-quarter loss
totaled $99 million, or $0.26 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $744 million, and
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses
(EBITDAX) was $787 million. During the quarter, Apache’s cash position increased to $1.2 billion.
“Apache’s solid second-quarter results are a testament to both the significant progress we have made on our
cost structure as well as the strength of our portfolio,” said John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive
officer and president. “During the quarter, we continued our efforts to reduce costs and improve capital
efficiency. Our LOE costs on a Boe basis were down 4 percent from the previous quarter and 17 percent
year-over-year.
“Despite an 85-percent reduction in capital investment since 2014, our base production has proven to be
very resilient. We sharply reduced activity in the first quarter of 2015 and have continued to reduce spending
as oil prices have remained relatively weak. Nevertheless, our production volumes have held up well, and
we are on track to deliver production in line with the increased guidance provided last quarter. Although our
2016 capital program is not intended to maximize near-term production, the efficiency and productivity gains
we have achieved are clearly demonstrated in our results.”
Second-quarter operational summary
Apache reported total worldwide production of 535,000 Boe per day and pro forma production of 461,000
Boe per day, which excludes Egypt noncontrolling interest and tax barrels. In North America Onshore,
production was 282,000 Boe per day while pro forma International and Offshore production was 179,000 Boe
per day.

Despite significant reductions in investment over the last 18 months, second-quarter North American
Onshore production volumes only declined 16,000 Boe per day from the first quarter. More than 10,000 Boe
per day of this decline came from lower-margin areas outside of the Permian Basin. International and
Offshore production was relatively flat from first quarter to second quarter.
Highlights from Apache’s key operating areas include:
●   North America Onshore – Apache placed on production 20 gross-operated wells during the
second quarter.
●   In the Delaware Basin, the company placed on production two gross-operated wells, including
the Blue Jay 103H Third Bone Springs well, which achieved a 30-day average rate of nearly
3,200 Boe per day.
●   In the Midland Basin, Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform, the company placed on
production 16 gross-operated wells. Apache generated strong production rates in the Midland
Basin from the Connell 38B 2HM and Connell 38C 2HM Wolfcamp B wells, each of which
achieved a 30-day average rate of approximately 1,300 Boe per day from one-mile laterals.
●   In the Woodford-SCOOP, the company placed on production two gross-operated wells,
including the Truman 3-28H, which achieved a 30-day average rate of approximately 1,800
Boe per day from a 4,400 foot lateral.
●   North Sea – Production averaged 71,000 Boe per day. During the quarter, the company achieved a
100-percent drilling success rate and placed on production

three strong development wells in the Beryl area: the LP7, BCR and FNT. Each well achieved a 30-
day average rate in excess of 6,000 Boe per day. During the quarter, the company also commenced
drilling the Storr prospect in the Beryl area, which was highlighted in the November 2015 North Sea
Investor Update Presentation.
●   Egypt – Gross production averaged 350,000 Boe per day, and net production, excluding minority
interest and tax barrels, averaged 101,000 Boe per day. During the quarter, Apache drilled 15 gross
wells with a 93-percent success rate.
2016 outlook and plan update
Apache has taken a conservative budgeting approach to 2016 with a planned oil price of $35 and an
overriding financial goal to spend within cash flow. As oil prices have begun to show modest signs of
improvement relative to the first quarter, Apache is slowly deploying incremental capital. The company
recently added a rig in the Midland Basin, is maintaining operations on two platform rigs in the North Sea,
and is accelerating strategic testing initiatives. Apache now expects to spend at the high end of its 2016
capital guidance range of $1.4 to $1.8 billion.
“Our conservative budgeting and rigorous allocation of capital over the last 18 months have resulted in
tangible benefits to the company. We refrained from significant development drilling in a low commodity-price
environment, and instead, turned our focus to capital efficiency improvements and strategic testing. As a
result, we have made significant progress on our cost structure and are positioning Apache very well for the
future,” concluded Christmann.

Non-GAAP financial measures
Apache’s financial information includes information prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP information. It is management’s intent to provide non-
GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of our consolidated financial information as prepared
in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX and net debt are non-GAAP measures.
This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with
the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-
GAAP measure.
Forward-looking statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be
identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,”
“guidance,” and similar references to future periods. These statements include, but are not limited to,
statements about future plans, expectations and objectives for Apache’s operations, including statements
about our capital plans, drilling plans, production expectations, asset sales, and monetizations. While
forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, whether actual results and developments will meet our expectations
and predictions depend on a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results,
performance, and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations. See “Risk Factors” in our 2015
Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of risk factors that affect our
business. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this news release speaks only as of the date on
which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time,
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-
looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future development or otherwise, except as may
be required by law.
Cautionary note to investors
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) permits oil and gas companies, in their
filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions
for such terms. Apache may use certain terms in this earnings release, such as “resources,” “potential
resources,” “resource potential,” “estimated net reserves,” “recoverable reserves,” and other similar terms that
the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit Apache from including in filings with the SEC. Such terms do not take into
account the certainty of resource recovery, which is contingent on exploration success, technical
improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors, and are therefore not indicative of expected
future resource recovery and should not be relied upon. Investors are urged to consider carefully the
disclosure in Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2015, available from
Apache at www.apachecorp.com or by writing Apache at: 2000 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 100, Houston, TX
77056 (Attn: Corporate Secretary). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330
or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

PRO FORMA PRODUCTION INFORMATION
Pro forma production excludes certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating
results for the periods presented. Pro forma production excludes production attributable to 1) divested assets,
2) noncontrolling interest in Egypt, and 3) Egypt tax barrels. Management uses pro forma production to
evaluate the company’s operational trends and performance and believes it is useful to investors and other
third parties.

RECONCILIATION OF INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES TO ADJUSTED EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a
company’s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to
shareholders. Adjusted EBITDAX generally excludes certain items that management believes affect the
comparability of operating results or are not related to Apache’s ongoing operations. Management uses
adjusted EBITDAX to evaluate the company’s operational trends and performance relative to other oil and
gas companies.

Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted earnings
generally exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results or are
not related to Apache’s ongoing operations. Management uses adjusted earnings to evaluate the company’s
operational trends and performance relative to other oil and gas companies. Management believes this
presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust
reported company earnings for items that may obscure underlying fundamentals and trends.
