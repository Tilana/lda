<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, submits 
to the Human Rights Council the present report on specific cases he has examined 
concerning alleged violations of the human rights of indigenous peoples in many parts of 
the world.  
</p>
<p>2. This report is complemented by, and should be considered along with, the joint 
communications report that is being submitted for the first time for all special procedures 
mandate holders (A/HRC/18/51). It has been determined that a joint communications report 
strengthens transparency and efficiency, and that it reduces documentation and related 
costs. Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other entity 
are included in the joint communications report. The complete texts of the communications 
sent and replies received are accessible electronically through hyperlinks in that report. 
</p>
<p>3. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
peoples on cases of alleged human rights violation between 1 December 2010 and 31 May 
2011, as well as replies received from Governments between 1 February 2011 and 31 July 
2011, are included in the joint communications report. As a transitional measure, the joint 
communications report also includes communications sent and replies received by the 
Special Rapporteur since he submitted his last communications report to the fifteenth 
session of the Council in September 2010 (in effect, the period covering 1 August 2010 to 1 
February 2011). This is to ensure full coverage given that the last reporting period of the 
Special Rapporteur ended in July 2010.  
</p>
<p>4. For ease of reference, the present report contains a tabulation of the cases examined 
by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples that are included in the joint 
communications report. The present report also contains, in annexes, the observations the 
Special Rapporteur has made, as well as descriptions of other follow-up measures he has 
taken, in a number of these cases. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The communications procedure 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since assuming his mandate in May 2008, the Special Rapporteur has placed 
particular focus on the Human Rights Council&#8217;s directive &#8220;To gather, request, receive and 
exchange information and communications from all relevant sources, including 
Governments, indigenous peoples and their communities and organizations, on alleged 
violations of the rights of indigenous peoples&#8221; (H.R.C. Res. 15/14, para. 1(b)) and to 
&#8220;formulate recommendations and proposals on appropriate measures and activities to 
prevent and remedy violations of [their] human rights&#8221; (para. 1(c)).  
</p>
<p>6. In accordance with his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has sent numerous 
communications to Governments transmitting information received by him of cases of 
alleged violations of human rights of indigenous peoples or individuals, and has solicited 
and in many cases received responses from the Governments. In some cases he has made 
detailed observations with specific recommendations or otherwise followed up to initial 
communications, all in a spirit of constructive dialogue and cooperation to address problem 
situations and their underlying causes.  
</p>
<p>7. In communicating with Governments on specific cases, the Special Rapporteur is for 
the most part responding to information submitted to him by indigenous peoples and their 
organizations, non-governmental organizations and other sources. Given the limited 
resources available, it is impossible for the Special Rapporteur to respond to every case that 
</p>
<p> <b>3 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>comes to his attention. However, in general, he does his best to act on detailed and credible 
information that presents a serious situation falling within his mandate and in which 
intervention has a reasonable chance of having a positive impact, either by drawing needed 
attention to the situation or by prompting government authorities or other actors into 
corrective action. Alternatively, the Special Rapporteur may take action where the situation 
is representative of, or connected to, a broader pattern of human rights violations against 
indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur has been careful to respond to allegations of 
human rights violations from a wide range of regions and countries, as reflected in the table 
of communications sent and replies received below. 
</p>
<p>8. The cases brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention make known that many 
ongoing barriers to the full enjoyment of the rights of indigenous peoples persist throughout 
the world. Especially common are cases involving threats to the traditional lands and 
resources of indigenous peoples, including the forced removal of indigenous groups from 
their lands. A related concern is the lack of participation of indigenous peoples in decisions 
concerning the use of their traditional lands and resources, including for natural resource 
extraction projects. Also common are threats to the physical wellbeing of indigenous 
individuals, which in extreme cases have resulted in violent conflicts. Other cases involve 
alleged threats to indigenous peoples&#8217; sacred sites and issues related to reforms in laws and 
policies related to indigenous peoples at the national level. 
</p>
<p>9. The usual first step in taking action on a case is for the Special Rapporteur to write 
an allegation letter (AL) or, in cases requiring immediate attention, an urgent appeal (UA) 
to the Government concerned, along with a request that the Government respond. The 
cooperation of the Government is essential to the effectiveness of the procedure. The 
Special Rapporteur is thankful that many of the Governments to which he directed 
communications during the period under review provided responses. The Special 
Rapporteur often takes steps to follow up to initial letters of allegation or urgent appeals, as 
described in Part IV.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Communications sent and replies received 
</b></p>
<p>10. Below are references to the letters sent by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples and replies received from the Governments concerned, along with short 
summaries of the allegations communicated, arranged in chronological order by the date of 
the letters sent by the Special Rapporteur. Included are communications sent and replies 
received since the last communications report of the Special Report (A/HRC/15/37/Add.1). 
Some of the replies by Governments refer to communications sent before the present 
reporting period. The complete texts of the communications sent and government replies 
can be accessed from the electronic version of the joint communications report 
(A/HRC/18/51), which is available on the website of the Human Rights Council. The 
tabulation below is taken substantially from the composite tabulation of communications of 
special procedures mandate holders that is included in the joint communications report; it is 
included here for ease of reference.

<p><b>The alleged situation of the planned construction of TransCanada North 
Central Corridor pipeline through lands of Lubicon Lake Nation</b>. 
According to the information received, the TransCanada Corporation has 
obtained permission from the Alberta Utilities Commission to build the 
pipeline, in the absence of the Lubicon Lake Nation&#8217;s consent or recognition 
of the Nation&#8217;s asserted rights of the area. This has also been carried out in the 
absence of adequate consideration to the Lubicon&#8217;s concerns over the health, 
safety and environmental impacts of the project. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur expressed concern over allegations about the broader issues of the 
land rights and social and economic conditions of the Lubicon people. See the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations on this situation, A/HRC/15/37/Add.1,

<p><b>Alleged development activities in and around the Prey Lang Forest.</b> 
According to the information received, the Prey Lang forest, spanning Preah 
Vihear, Kompong Thom, Kratie, and Stung Treng provinces in northern 
Cambodia, is inhabited by nearly 350,000 indigenous people, primarily of Kuy 
descent. Road construction and other development projects have reportedly 
been taking place without complying with domestic norms that might 
safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples, and the indigenous communities 
stand to lose access to the forest resources upon which their livelihoods 
depend. In a letter of 30 March 2010, the Government of Cambodia responded 
to the communication, see A/HRC/15/37/Add.1, para. 75.<b>

<p><b>Alleged arrest and torture of human rights defenders.</b> According to the 
information received, on 14 September 2009, Mr. Jiten Yumnam, member of 
the Coordinating Committee of the Asia Pacific Indigenous Youth Network 
and Joint-Secretary of Citizens&#8217; Concerns on Dam and Development, was 
arrested at Imphal Airport in Manipur, while on his way to a regional meeting 
on climate change in Bangkok, Thailand. On the same day, eight other 
individuals were arrested. On 15 September, all eight were brought before the 
Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate in Lamphel and subsequently remanded 
in police custody until 29 September. They had reportedly been charged with 
&#8216;attempting to wage war&#8217; and &#8216;conspiring to commit offences against the State.

informaci&#243;n recibida, el Gobierno habr&#237;a otorgado una concesi&#243;n a la empresa 
canadiense Montana Exploradora, S.A. (subsidiaria de la transnacional 
canadiense Goldcorp) para extraer y explotar oro y plata. El proyecto, llamada 
el proyecto mina Marlin, ocupa las municipales de San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n y 
Sipakapa, ocupados por pueblos mam y sipacapense. El Gobierno no habr&#237;a 
consultado con la poblaci&#243;n antes de otorgar la concesi&#243;n. Se alega que las 
actividades mineras en la zona han creado conflictos dentro de las 
comunidades afectadas, y que han resultado en efectos negativos sobre el 
medioambiente. Con la cooperaci&#243;n del Gobierno de Guatemala, el Relator

Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, aproximadamente 45 efectivos de tropas 
especiales de carabineros fueron enviados por el Gobierno de Chile a la Isla de 
Pascua &#8211; Rapa Nui con el fin de desalojar un grupo de alrededor de 15 familias 
del pueblo ind&#237;gena Rapa Nui. Desde el 31 de julio de 2010, estas personas 
hab&#237;an ocupado diversos establecimientos fiscales del Estado chileno como 
acto de reivindicaci&#243;n de sus tierras ancestrales. El 9 de agosto, se realiz&#243; un 
desalojo con base en una orden judicial, de las propiedades ocupadas, la cual 
se realiz&#243; pac&#237;ficamente. Sin embargo, exist&#237;a el temor de que se realizaron 
m&#225;s desalojos debido a las declaraciones de los funcionarios de Gobierno de 
estar dispuestos a desalojar forzosamente a las personas que mantienen &#8220;tomas 
ilegales&#8221; y no entreguen los lugares ocupados. Esta situaci&#243;n fue objeto de dos

<p><b>Alleged non-return of exhumed bodies from Hmong graves at Wat Tham 
Krabok. </b>According to the information received, Hmong have repeatedly sent 
delegations to dialogue with Government officials in order to achieve a 
resolution of the pending issues concerning the return of the exhumed bodies. 
The relatives of the deceased Hmong and members of the Hmong 
communities worldwide have made specific requests to the Thai Government 
and Thai foundations in possession of the remains of the exhumed bodies for 
what they would consider to be an acceptable solution to their grievances. This 
situation was the subject of observations by the Special Rapporteur; see 
A/HRC/12/34/Add.1, paras. 404-429, and Annex IX, below.<b>

<p><b>Alleged use of reclaimed wastewater for commercial ski operations in a 
sacred site. </b>According to the information received, the San Francisco Peaks, 
located north of the city of Flagstaff, Arizona, &#8211; a site considered sacred by 
several Native American tribes - is being used by the Arizona Snowbowl 
Resort Limited Partnership to operate a commercial project for recreational 
skiing. The Government has approved the use of recycled wastewater to make 
artificial snow for the project. This may reportedly cause a significant negative 
impact on the religious practices and beliefs of the Native American tribes for 
which the area of the San Francisco Peaks is sacred. To them, the sacredness 
of the San Francisco Peaks depends on the purity of the water and plant life in 
the area, which allegedly will be contaminated if wastewater is introduced into 
the Peaks through the planned artificial snowmaking. See the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s observations on this case in Annex X, below.<b>

<p><b>Allegation that Bedouin people are being removed from their traditional 
lands.</b> According to the information received, land policy in Israel has failed 
to recognize Bedouin legal entitlement to their traditional lands in the Negev. 
Around half of the Negev Bedouins live in so-called &#8220;unrecognized villages&#8221;, 
which allegedly lack basic services such as running water, electricity, waste 
removal, telephone lines, paved roads, schools and health facilities. Bedouins 
in these villages have experienced ongoing demolitions of their homes and 
villages in the Negev by Israeli authorities. The Government has created seven 
urban towns and moved Bedouin from the &#8220;unrecognized villages&#8221; to these 
towns. The people in these towns reportedly rank at the bottom of all social 
and economic indicators, and suffer from the highest unemployment rates and 
income levels in Israel. Bedouins reportedly cannot live in their traditional 
manner in these urban areas. The Israel Land Administration reportedly had 
plans to create several new villages or towns for the Bedouins. See the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s observations on this case in Annex VI, below.<b>

from severe health problems. </b>According to the information received, Mr. 
Leonard Peltier, aged 66, an indigenous Anishinabe/Lakota activist, had been 
serving two life sentences in a United States federal prison, after being 
convicted in 1977 for the murder of two FBI agents. Over the years, Mr. 
Peltier has maintained his innocence, asserting that he was politically 
persecuted for his activities as a member of the American Indian Movement. 
Mr. Peltier reportedly suffers from severe health problems that require urgent 
and immediate medical treatment. In addition to his health situation, Mr. 
Peltier reportedly lives in substandard conditions at the maximum security 
prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. The Lewisburg prison is allegedly known 
for violence among inmates.<b>

received, the Gibe III dam is being constructed by two Chinese companies. 
The dam will allegedly block the southwestern part of the Omo River, on the 
border of Ethiopia and Kenya, creating a 150 km long reservoir and reducing 
downstream flows. The Lower Omo River Valley is populated by some 
500,000 people belonging to diverse indigenous peoples. Competition over

<p><b>Alleged failure to recognize and respect native customary land rights. 
</b>According to the information received, the Kayan indigenous community of 
the Long Teran Kanan village in Tinjar, Miri, Sarawak had been involved in a 
legal dispute over their land for 12 years. The Miri High Court allegedly ruled 
in favour of the community on 31 March 2010. One of the defendants, IOI 
Pelita Plantation Sdn. Bhd., appealed the judgment and had allegedly not 
respected the court order in the interim, continuing palm oil operations in the 
community. The village&#8217;s crops have reportedly been bulldozed and planted 
with oil palms, destroying the Kayan people&#8217;s traditional livelihoods and 
threatening their right to food. This case is reportedly emblematic of the over 
200 cases before the Sarawak courts relating to indigenous communities&#8217; 
ability to exercise their native customary rights over their lands, upon which 
they depend for fishing, hunting or farming, and which are essential to their 
cultural survival. See the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations on this case in

company Karuturi, and 10,000 hectares to the Saudi Star Company with 
another 240,000 hectares more likely to be leased to the Saudi Star Company. 
Reportedly this had been done without any prior consultation with local 
people. Moreover, the Federal Government had reportedly officially revealed 
its plan to displace 45,000 Anywa people (half of the total Anywa population) 
in the coming three years. In Abobo district, the Saudi Star agriculture

<p><b> IV. Observations and other follow-up by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>11. Within the bounds of available resources, the Special Rapporteur often takes 
concrete steps to follow up to his letters of allegation or urgent appeals. In the annexes 
hereto, the Special Rapporteur reports on cases in which he is providing such follow-up.   
</p>
<p>12. In most of the cases included in the annexes, the Special Rapporteur has provided 
detailed observations with analyses of the issues raised and specific recommendations to 
the States concerned. These observations were developed after cross checking or receiving 
government confirmation of the information received and after making a determination that 
the situations indicated pressing problems requiring focused attention. He will continue to 
follow up on these cases and may in the future provide detailed observations and 
recommendations for other cases included in this report. The Special Rapporteur offers 
these observations and recommendations in an ongoing effort to engage Governments in 
constructive dialogue conducive to finding solutions to problems and building good 
practices.  
</p>
<p>13. The annexes also report on cases in which he has provided other kinds of follow-up 
to communications of alleged human rights violations. Such other follow-up consists of 
additional correspondence in light of new developments or information received, on-site 
visits with in-depth reports, face-to-face meetings with Government officials, and public 
statements. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur strives to be appropriately selective in the cases to which he 
devotes significant follow-up efforts, focusing on situations that are especially problematic 
or are emblematic of issues that are faced by indigenous peoples in particular countries or 
throughout the world. Through the in-depth analysis of specific situations, the Special 
Rapporteur is aiming to consolidate approaches for addressing similar kinds of problems 
and developing appropriate responses. He also seeks to identify and promote good practices 
for addressing these common problems, where these exist, and to reinforce the application 
of relevant international standards. In this connection, the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides the principle normative frame of reference for 
examining situations and making recommendations. Where appropriate, the Special 
Rapporteur has highlighted relevant articles of the Declaration, in addition to articles of 
other applicable human rights instruments, when communicating with States about specific 
cases and making evaluative observations.

por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista en su contra 
</b></p>
<p>  CHL 2/2010 
</p>
<p>1. El 16 de septiembre de 2010, el Relator Especial sobre los derechos de los pueblos 
ind&#237;genas, James Anaya, llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n al Gobierno de Chile sobre informaci&#243;n recibida 
en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n de las personas mapuche encarceladas que realizaban una 
huelga de hambre en protesta por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista en su contra. El texto 
completo de esta comunicaci&#243;n es accesible en la versi&#243;n electr&#243;nica del informe conjunto 
de comunicaciones de los titulares de mandatos de los procedimientos especiales 
(A/HRC/18/51), disponible en el sitio web del Consejo de Derechos Humanos.  
</p>
<p>2. Esta situaci&#243;n se enmarcaba dentro de la problem&#225;tica general de la aplicaci&#243;n de la 
ley antiterrorista en casos relacionados con los actos de protesta social realizados por 
miembros del pueblo mapuche la cual ha sido objeto de observaciones y recomendaciones 
por parte del Relator Especial en su informe sobre la situaci&#243;n de los pueblos ind&#237;genas en 
Chile de septiembre de 2009 (A/HRC/12/34.Add.6, p&#225;rrs. 40-47 y 57-62) y en su informe 
sobre casos examinados en 2009-2010 (A/HRC/15/37.Add.1, p&#225;rrs. 136-168).  
</p>
<p>3. El Relator Especial dio seguimiento a su comunicaci&#243;n al Gobierno de Chile sobre 
la huelga de hambre mediante conversaciones con el Gobierno y una declaraci&#243;n p&#250;blica, 
emitida el 24 de septiembre de 2010. Posteriormente, el 5 de octubre de 2010, el Relator 
Especial envi&#243; otra carta al Gobierno relacionada con el acuerdo firmado el 1 de octubre de 
2010 entre el Gobierno y los representantes de la mayor&#237;a de los presos mapuche en huelga 
de hambre. 
</p>
<p><b>  Declaraci&#243;n p&#250;blica del Relator Especial sobre la huelga de hambre 
</b></p>
<p>4. El texto completo de la declaraci&#243;n p&#250;blica del Relator Especial emitida el 24 de 
septiembre de 2010 se encuentra a continuaci&#243;n: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Quisiera dar a conocer a todos los interesados que en los &#250;ltimos d&#237;as he mantenido 
contacto permanente con el Gobierno de Chile, sosteniendo conversaciones y un 
intercambio de informaci&#243;n acerca de la situaci&#243;n de las 34 personas mapuche que 
han estado en huelga de hambre por m&#225;s de dos meses en diversos centros de la 
regi&#243;n del B&#237;o B&#237;o y de la Araucan&#237;a. He expresado mi m&#225;s profunda preocupaci&#243;n 
por esta situaci&#243;n y la necesidad de avanzar hacia la soluci&#243;n de los varios asuntos 
relacionados a las demandas de las personas en huelga de hambre. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Las 34 personas en huelga de hambre se encuentran entre las 58 personas mapuche y 
sus simpatizantes que han sido procesadas o condenadas bajo la ley antiterrorista (N&#186; 
18.314) de Chile. Entiendo que los presos mapuche en huelga de hambre demandan 
al Estado: (1) el t&#233;rmino de la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista en causas que les 
involucran; (2) el t&#233;rmino del procesamiento de algunos de los presos mapuche por 
la justicia militar; (3) la desmilitarizaci&#243;n de las zonas mapuche en que las 
comunidades reivindican derechos humanos pol&#237;ticos y territoriales; y (4) la 
restituci&#243;n de tierras ancestrales mapuche. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Tanto yo como mi antecesor, Profesor Rodolfo Stavenhagen, hemos expresado 
nuestra preocupaci&#243;n sobre la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista en este contexto y 
hemos hecho varias observaciones y recomendaciones espec&#237;ficas al respecto. 
</p>
<p><b>12</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>Asimismo, varios &#243;rganos de tratados de los Naciones Unidas, incluyendo el Comit&#233; 
de Derechos Humanos, el Comit&#233; contra la Tortura y el Comit&#233; para la Eliminaci&#243;n de 
la Discriminaci&#243;n Racial, han expresado su preocupaci&#243;n por la aplicaci&#243;n de la ley 
antiterrorista en este contexto. A pesar de ello, los acontecimientos recientes de la 
huelga de hambre indican una falta de implementaci&#243;n adecuada de estas 
recomendaciones, y ponen en evidencia el descontento existente en torno a los 
problemas de fondo que dan origen a la protesta social. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Tal como he expresado anteriormente, desapruebo el uso de la violencia como 
medida de protesta, a&#250;n cuando la protesta sea por reivindicaciones leg&#237;timas, al 
igual que repruebo la falta de respeto a los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas que 
puedan llevar a la conflictividad. A la vez, estoy m&#225;s que convencido que la 
aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista en este contexto conlleva una serie de problemas 
procesales y de fondo que solamente puedan agravar la situaci&#243;n, y que la 
calificaci&#243;n de los delitos imputados como actos de terrorismo podr&#237;a ser 
inconducente e inapropiada dentro de la normativa internacional pertinente. 
Cualquier procesamiento penal de personas mapuche por hechos delictivos en este 
contexto deber&#237;a ser a trav&#233;s de la justicia penal ordinaria, con todas las garant&#237;as 
aplicables del debido proceso. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Junto con reiterar las recomendaciones citadas, insto al Gobierno a desarrollar el 
m&#225;ximo esfuerzo para iniciar un di&#225;logo de buena fe con los representantes de los 
presos mapuche, como paso fundamental para la b&#250;squeda de soluciones 
constructivas orientadas a responder a las preocupaciones y solicitudes de la huelga.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Al respecto, he recibido informaci&#243;n por parte del Gobierno que, con el aval de las 
autoridades, el obispo de Concepci&#243;n est&#225; ejerciendo buenos oficios para buscar una 
soluci&#243;n concreta. Quisiera instar al Gobierno a que en ese proceso de di&#225;logo se 
hagan los esfuerzos por generar la confianza necesaria para llegar a una resoluci&#243;n 
exitosa de esta situaci&#243;n y que se exploren todas las alternativas de soluciones 
jur&#237;dicas y pol&#237;ticas. Igualmente, quisiera instar a las personas mapuche en huelga de 
hambre as&#237; como los dem&#225;s l&#237;deres y miembros del pueblo mapuche interesados a 
que tambi&#233;n realicen esfuerzos de buena fe para dialogar constructivamente con el 
Gobierno a fin de encontrar soluciones a sus demandas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Tomo nota de la informaci&#243;n proporcionada por el Gobierno sobre los proyectos de 
ley para modificar la ley antiterrorista y la ley sobre justicia militar que est&#225;n siendo 
considerados por el Congreso actualmente. Quisiera reiterar que es crucial que el 
Estado reforme la ley antiterrorista, adoptando definiciones precisas de los tipos 
penales de delitos de terrorismo ajustados a las normas internacionales aplicables, 
as&#237; como asegurar que las reformas de estas leyes se ajusten a los est&#225;ndares 
internacionales sobre derechos humanos, en particular respecto al debido proceso. 
Considero de igual importancia es que se faciliten espacios de participaci&#243;n y 
consulta a representantes del pueblo mapuche en los procesos de reforma de estas 
leyes, las cuales han tenido una efecto directo sobre sus miembros.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Asimismo, he recibido informaci&#243;n del Gobierno, respecto al anuncio del 
establecimiento de  una mesa de di&#225;logo paralela integrada por el Gobierno, 
representantes del pueblo mapuche, las iglesias cat&#243;licas y evang&#233;licas y 
organizaciones civiles para tratar programas de desarrollo regional. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Valorando la disposici&#243;n del Gobierno de iniciar un di&#225;logo de fondo con 
representantes del pueblo mapuche, quisiera se&#241;alar al Gobierno que es esencial 
asegurar que todo proceso de di&#225;logo se realice en un marco de confianza y buena 
fe, y de acuerdo a las normas  de consulta y participaci&#243;n que impone el Convenio 
169 de la OIT en vigor en Chile.

<p>&#8226; Finalmente, reitero que los distintos poderes del Estado deben abordar, en conjunto 
con los pueblos ind&#237;genas, los asuntos de fondo de la actual crisis los cuales se 
relacionan con la falta de implementaci&#243;n cabal de los derechos de los pueblos 
ind&#237;genas especial sobre sus tierras ancestrales, recursos naturales, consulta previa, 
as&#237; como a la  participaci&#243;n en las decisiones que les conciernen. Al respecto, 
enfatizo que la Declaraci&#243;n de los Derechos de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas de la ONU y 
el Convenio 169 de la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional del Trabajo&#8212;que cumpli&#243; un a&#241;o

<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n del Relator Especial al Gobierno de Chile del 5 de 
octubre de 2010

<p>5. El 5 de octubre de 2010, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta al Gobierno de Chile 
relacionada con la informaci&#243;n recibida sobre un acuerdo firmado el primero de octubre de 
2010 entre el Gobierno de Chile y los representantes de los presos mapuches en huelga de 
hambre en las c&#225;rceles de Concepci&#243;n, Temuco, Lebu y Valdivia, junto con informaci&#243;n 
que hab&#237;a recibido sobre los presos mapuches en la C&#225;rcel de Angol.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>6. En resumen, el Relator Especial comunic&#243; que el acuerdo alcanzado puso de 
manifiesto el valor del di&#225;logo para resolver conflictos y de la existencia de voluntad de las 
partes, tanto del Gobierno como de los representantes de los presos mapuches por realizar 
esfuerzos para llegar a acuerdos. El Relator Especial inst&#243; al Gobierno de Chile a que el 
acuerdo fuera implementado cabalmente. El Relator Especial valor&#243; que el acuerdo se 
enmarcaba en las obligaciones de Chile bajo el Convenio No. 169 de la Organizaci&#243;n 
Internacional de Trabajo y expres&#243; su esperanza de que este avance fuera reflejo del 
compromiso del Estado chileno en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n del pueblo mapuche y de todos 
los pueblos ind&#237;genas de Chile. 
</p>
<p>7. En relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n de los presos mapuches en la C&#225;rcel de Angol, de acuerdo 
a la informaci&#243;n recibida, su negativa a adherirse al acuerdo respond&#237;a b&#225;sicamente a la 
desconfianza en la efectiva implementaci&#243;n de un cambio en la pol&#237;tica penal. El Relator 
Especial inst&#243; al Gobierno de Chile y a los representantes de los presos mapuches de Angol 
a persistir en el esfuerzo de di&#225;logo a fin de consolidar lo avanzado y encontrar soluciones a 
las demandas. 
</p>
<p>8. El Relator Especial reiter&#243; al respecto de sus observaciones hechas en su declaraci&#243;n 
p&#250;blica del 24 de septiembre de 2010, que era crucial que el Estado reformara la ley 
antiterrorista adoptando definiciones precisas de los tipos penales de delitos de terrorismo 
ajustados a las normas internacionales aplicables. Asimismo, reiter&#243; que los distintos 
poderes del estado deben abordar, en conjunto con los pueblos ind&#237;genas, los asuntos de 
fondo de la crisis, los cuales se relacionaban con la falta de implementaci&#243;n cabal de los 
derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, en especial sus derechos sobre sus tierras ancestrales, 
recursos naturales, consulta previa y a la participaci&#243;n en las decisiones que les conciernen.

<p><b>  Chile: Situaci&#243;n del pueblo Rapa Nui en la Isla de Pascua  
</b></p>
<p>  CHL 1/2010, CHL 4/2010 
</p>
<p>1. El 13 de agosto de 2010, el Relator Especial sobre los derechos de los pueblos 
ind&#237;genas, James Anaya, transmiti&#243; al Estado de Chile informaci&#243;n recibida sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de amenaza de desalojo forzado de familias del pueblo Rapa Nui en la Isla de 
Pascua. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, docenas de carabineros fueron enviados por el 
Gobierno de Chile a la Isla de Pascua con el fin de desalojar un grupo de alrededor de 15 
familias del pueblo ind&#237;gena Rapa Nui, que hab&#237;an estado ocupando diversos 
establecimientos en la isla. Los clanes ocupaban los establecimientos como un acto de 
reivindicaci&#243;n de sus tierras ancestrales y de los derechos que consideran les corresponden 
bajo el tratado de anexi&#243;n de la isla que se suscribi&#243; con Chile en 1888. Con estos actos, 
exig&#237;an al Gobierno de Chile la devoluci&#243;n de tierras ancestrales de las familias Rapa Nui 
que por decenas de a&#241;os hab&#237;an sido propietarias de esas tierras y que actualmente est&#225;n 
ocupadas por entidades estatales. Tambi&#233;n exig&#237;an un mayor control migratorio y mayor 
reconocimiento de su autogobierno. Se tem&#237;a que dicho desalojo pudiera resultar en 
violaciones de los derechos humanos de los manifestantes. 
</p>
<p>2. El Relator Especial de nuevo llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno a la situaci&#243;n del 
pueblo Rapa Nui mediante cartas al Gobierno de Chile con fecha de 9 de diciembre de 2010 
y 10 de enero de 2011. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida y transmitida en estas 
comunicaciones, el 3 de diciembre de 2010, aproximadamente 45 efectivos policiales 
desalojaron a miembros de la familia Tuko Tuki, quienes ocupaban una propiedad en 
Hanga Roa, la capital de la Isla de Pascua. El clan Tuko Tuki reclama dicha propiedad, 
actualmente a nombre de un propietario privado, como parte de su tierra ancestral. Tres 
personas Rapa Nui fueron detenidas: Roberto Ika Pakarati, Verenca Ika Pakarati y 
Margarita Pakarati Tuki. Un grupo de aproximadamente veinticinco personas Rapa Nui 
intentaron reingresar al terreno desalojado y fueron repelidas por los carabineros con 
balines, resultando heridas diecisiete personas, incluyendo el Sr. Nui Leviante Araki, 
presidente del Parlamento Rapa Nui.   
</p>
<p>3. En su carta del 10 de enero de 2011, el Relator Especial not&#243; con preocupaci&#243;n que 
el 29 de diciembre de 2010 ocurrieron nuevos actos de desalojo, esta vez en contra de 
aproximadamente 70 personas Rapa Nui que ocupaban pac&#237;ficamente la plaza Riro Kainga 
en el centro de Hanga Roa. Asimismo, el Relator Especial inform&#243; al Gobierno de Chile de 
su intenci&#243;n de hacer p&#250;blicas sus preocupaciones sobre los repetidos desalojos y la falta de 
resoluci&#243;n de los asuntos subyacentes, por medio de una declaraci&#243;n p&#250;blica.  
</p>
<p>4. Posteriormente, el 12 de enero de 2011, el Relator Especial emiti&#243; la declaraci&#243;n 
p&#250;blica sobre el asunto. El Relator Especial exhort&#243; al Gobierno a evitar nuevos desalojos, 
desplegar el m&#225;ximo esfuerzo para llevar a cabo un di&#225;logo de buena fe con representantes 
del pueblo Rapa Nui para atender justamente sus reclamos, tomar las medidas necesarias 
para evitar amenazas o da&#241;os a la seguridad f&#237;sica de personas y sancionar a las personas 
responsables de cualquier uso excesivo o desproporcionado de la fuerza. 
</p>
<p>5. El Gobierno de Chile respondi&#243; a cada una de las comunicaciones del Relator 
Especial sobre este caso, mediante cartas del 8 de octubre de 2010, del 4 de enero de 2011 y 
del 25 de enero de 2011. En resumen, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n proporcionada por el Gobierno, 
el Estado hab&#237;a tomado medidas para atender la situaci&#243;n del pueblo Rapa Nui, incluyendo 
la conformaci&#243;n de mesas de di&#225;logo para tratar los reclamos de este pueblo sobre sus

</b></p>
<p><b>  Ethiopia: Situation of the Gilgel Gibe III hydroelectric 
project on the Omo River 
</b></p>
<p>  ETH 1/2011 
</p>
<p>1. In a communication of 18 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, called the attention of the Government of Ethiopia to 
information received regarding the construction of the Gibe III hydroelectric project on the 
Omo River in Ethiopia. The full text of this communication can be accessed from the 
electronic version of the joint communications report (A/HRC/18/51), which is available on 
the web site of the Human Rights Council. This communication followed a previous letter 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on 10 June 2009, which was reflected his 2009 annual report 
to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/12/34/Add.1, paras. 113-122). He regrets that, at the 
time of finalization of this report, there is no record of a response by the Government of 
Ethiopia in the files of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to either his 
communication of 18 February 2011 or his previous communication of 10 June 2009. In the 
absence of a response by the Government of Ethiopia to his communications about the Gibe 
III hydroelectric project within 60 days as requested, the Special Rapporteur developed the 
observations below, which include an evaluation of the situation within the framework of 
relevant international standards. These observations were transmitted to the Government on 
13 July 2011.1
</p>
<p><b>  Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. According to the information received, Ethiopia is constructing the Gilgel Gibe III 
hydroelectric dam, which, once completed, will block the southwestern part of the Omo 
River on the border of Ethiopia and Kenya, creating a 150-km long reservoir. The Lower 
Omo River Valley is inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Dasenech, 
Karo, Hamer, Mursi, Murle, Mugugi and Nyangatom, who have developed complex land 
and resource use practices adapted to the harsh conditions of the region. These peoples rely 
on the Omo River for grazing and watering livestock, which produce blood, milk, and meat 
for subsistence as well as income.  
</p>
<p>3. Sources indicate that the natural flooding cycle of the river creates the conditions 
necessary for flood retreat cultivation, an essential agricultural practice in the semi-arid 
climate of the region. According to the information received, the Gibe III dam will 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Special Rapporteur also brought aspects of this situation to the attention of the Governments of 
</p>
<p>China and Kenya, by separate communications of 18 February 2011. The full text of these letters can 
be accessed from the electronic version of the joint communications report (A/HRC/18/51), which is 
available on the web site of the Human Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur addressed concerns to 
Kenya about the alleged impacts on several indigenous peoples in Kenya resulting from anticipated 
changes in the flow into Kenya of the Omo River as a result of the Gibe III dam. Concerns were 
addressed to China because, according to information received, the construction of the dam is being 
financed by a bank owned by the Government of China. China did respond to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s communication in a note dated 15 July 2011, the full text of which can be accessed from 
the electronic version of the joint communications report (A/HRC/18/51), which is available on the 
web site of the Human Rights Council. The observations below are directed only to the Government 
of Ethiopia, although in the future the Special Rapporteur may develop observations directed at the 
Governments of China or Kenya, or otherwise follow up with those Governments on this case.  
</p>
<p><b>18</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>eliminate this natural flooding cycle and reduce the flow of the river, threatening these 
traditional practices and means of subsistence, and potentially endangering local food 
security. Further, it is alleged that competition over increasingly scarce land and resources 
in Ethiopia could also exacerbate inter-ethnic conflict. The Gibe III project will also 
potentially affect the water and salinity levels of Lake Turkana, the only large body of 
water in Kenya&#8217;s arid northwestern region. Lake Turkana is the primary water source for 
six indigenous ethnic groups in Kenya &#8211; the Turkana, Elmolo, Samburu, Gabbra, Rendille 
and Daasanach &#8211; comprising some 300,000 people.  
</p>
<p>4. Reportedly, although activities related to the construction of the Gibe III project 
began in 2006, the Government did not initiate assessment of the environmental and social 
impacts of the projects until 2008. There were also questions raised about the accuracy and 
impartiality of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment in evaluating the impacts 
of the Gibe III dam. Finally, it is alleged that consultations about the dam were conducted 
by very few people, as compared to the total number of people affected, and did not take 
place until after construction of the Gibe III project had begun. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>5. Although the Special Rapporteur never received a response from the Government of 
Ethiopia to his letters of 18 February 2011 and 10 June 2009, many of the concerns he 
raised in those letters have been directly addressed by the Government of Ethiopia in 
various public documents issued over the past months, including in the Government&#8217;s 
website about the project2 and in the report developed by the Ethiopian Electric Power 
Corporation entitled &#8220;Reaction to Issues Raised by &#8216;South China Morning Post&#8217; concerning 
the Gibe III HEP&#8221;3. The principle issues raised by the Special Rapporteur that are 
addressed in these public documents relate to: (1) the effect of the Gibe III dam on the 
traditional flooding cycles of the Omo River, and consequently on the livelihoods of the 
indigenous peoples that depend on the river; (2) the effect of the Gibe III project on Lake 
Turkana and indigenous groups that depend on that lake, in Kenya; and (3) the adequacy of 
consultations carried out with affected indigenous peoples.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Social and Environmental Effects 
</i></p>
<p>6. With respect to the effects of the Gibe III dam on the traditional flood retreat 
cultivation and other traditional practices of affected indigenous peoples, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that the Government has, in fact, recognized that the dam will replace the 
Omo River&#8217;s national flooding cycle, likely affecting some 100,000 people who practice 
traditional flood recession agriculture during a portion of the year. However, according to 
available information from the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, measures are being 
taken to create an artificial flooding system that simulates the natural flooding process of 
the Omo River, in order to ensure that the traditional flood retreat agriculture practices of 
indigenous peoples along the Omo River can continue, and to mitigate any adverse impacts 
in this regard. In fact, the Government of Ethiopia indicated that the hydroelectric project 
will actually bring positive benefits, since it will help protect against dangerous flooding of 
the Omo River and will involve small-scale irrigation projects that provide water resources 
to the region more consistently than under the current system. The Government also 
pointed out that this availability of water, as well as planned fish farming and animal

</p>
<p> <b>19 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>husbandry initiatives contemplated alongside the project, will help stabilize any inter-ethnic 
conflicts in the region.  
</p>
<p>7. With respect to the impact of the Gibe III hydroelectric project on Lake Turkana in 
Kenya, the public documents issued by the Government assured that the results of studies 
carried out as part of the Government&#8217;s environmental impact assessment, as well as 
independent assessments, have concluded that water levels in Lake Turkana will remain 
more or less consistent with their present state following construction of the hydroelectric 
project, with a maximum estimated fluctuation of only 0.6 meters, which will not result in 
changes to the drinkability of the water. In fact, the Government concluded that the Gibe III 
project and its artificial flooding initiatives will actually have a &#8220;positive impact on 
controlling the fluctuation of the lake water&#8221;, especially during the dry season.4 The 
information provided by the Government also emphasized that the communities around 
Lake Turkana have expressed support for Gibe III project. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur cannot help but notice that there appears to be a major 
divergence of opinion regarding the potential environmental and social impacts of the Gibe 
III project. On the one hand, the Government hails the benefits of the project and assures 
that it is taking measures to address in full any potential adverse impacts. On the other 
hand, sources of information with whom the Special Rapporteur has been in contact predict 
catastrophic consequences of the hydroelectric project on the environment and local 
communities, and indicate that the Government has not put in place adequate mitigation 
measures to offset these consequences. 
</p>
<p>9. Given the limitations of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, he is unable to make 
any in-depth technical or scientific conclusions about the impacts of the Gibe III project. 
However, he will continue to review all available sources of information about the Gibe III 
project and may make additional observations in the future, taking into consideration this 
information. In addition, in light of the divergent views on this project, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to make all efforts to make public all studies on the 
Gibe III project and to continue to provide constant, impartial information about the 
hydroelectric project and its impacts to affected indigenous peoples and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, the Government and in particular the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, 
should continue to identify and implement alternate or additional mitigation and 
compensation measures, and make any alterations to the project design, should these be 
deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p><i>  Issues related to consultation 
</i></p>
<p>10. Finally, with respect to consultations carried out, the Government has stated that, 
from 2006-2008, it carried out a public consultation process, in accordance, says the 
Government, with the Ethiopian Constitution, which states that &#8220;People have the right to 
full consultation and to the expression of views in the planning and implementation of 
environmental policies and projects that affect them directly&#8221; (article 92.3). It bears 
mention that the information provided in the public documents of the Ethiopian Electric 
Power Corporation coincides with the information the Special Rapporteur received from 
other sources regarding the approximate number of people consulted about the Gibe III 
project. In particular, both the Government and other sources of information noted that only 
around 2,000 people participated in the public consultation process, even though some 
100,000 people may be affected by the Gibe III project within Ethiopia. The Government 
has expressed that those consulted were &#8220;satisfied with the mitigation measures and the 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Ibid.  
</p>
<p><b>20</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>proposed plans of the project&#8221;5 and believe that it &#8220;contributes to the attainment of the 
local, regional and national development goals&#8221;6.  
</p>
<p>11. It is not clear from the Government&#8217;s information whether these consultations were 
in fact carried out in accordance with the traditional decision-making structures of the 
affected indigenous peoples, as required by article 19 of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which states that &#8220;States shall consult and cooperate in 
good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative 
institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and 
implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them.&#8221; However, the 
Special Rapporteur received information from other sources that alleged, under the 
traditional systems of the groups living along the Omo River, decisions are made in 
meetings involving the entire community, which indicates that consultations with only 
2,000 out of 100,000 affected peoples would not conform to traditional decision-making 
procedures, as required by international standards. In this connection, it may be necessary 
for the Government to carry out additional consultations with a greater number of affected 
indigenous peoples in order to ensure that they have had the opportunity to consider the 
project and present their views in response, in accordance with their own representative 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>12. In addition, the Government&#8217;s information does not provide a clear picture of the 
information that was provided to indigenous peoples in this public consultation process. In 
this connection, the Special Rapporteur would be grateful if the Government of Ethiopia 
could inform him of the content of information conveyed to the affected indigenous peoples 
during the consultations. The Special Rapporteur does note, however, that the Government 
has stated that the consultations were designed to &#8220;inform, and contribute to identifying 
potential impacts of the project, either negative or positive or both, and prioritize the 
remedial measures for the identified impacts; include the attitudes of the community and 
officials who will be affected by the project so that their views and proposals are 
mainstreamed to formulate mitigation and benefit enhancement measures; [and] increase 
public awareness and understanding of the project, and ensure its acceptance&#8221;7. While some 
aspects of these stated goals of the consultations coincide with international standards, the 
Special Rapporteur expresses his concern that the consultations were carried out with the 
goal to &#8220;ensure [the project&#8217;s] acceptance&#8221;, which indicates that the consultations were 
carried out with a predetermined outcome. Under relevant international standards, 
consultations should involve a genuine opportunity for indigenous peoples to present their 
views and to influence decision-making, and the option of not proceeding with the 
proposed project should not be foreclosed during these consultations. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur understands that the Government of Ethiopia has planned 
future public consultations on the Gibe III projects. In this connection, under article 32 of 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples governments must 
&#8220;consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their 
own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to 
the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, 
particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, 
water or other resources&#8221;. In the present case, given the magnitude of the Gibe III dam 
project and its potential effects on indigenous peoples in surrounding areas, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that there is a need for concerted efforts to carry out adequate

<p><b>Annex VI 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Israel: Situation of unrecognized Bedouin villages in the 
Negev desert   
</b></p>
<p>  ISR 2/2011 
</p>
<p>1. In his communication of 1 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, called the attention of the Government of Israel to the 
alleged demolitions of &#8220;unrecognized&#8221; Bedouin villages in the Negev desert and the 
relocation of their inhabitants to government-planned villages. The full text of this 
communication can be accessed from the electronic version of the joint communications 
report (A/HRC/18/51), which is available on the web site of the Human Rights Council. 
This communication followed a request by the Special Rapporteur for a visit to Israel to 
examine the situation of the Bedouin people in the Negev, transmitted to the Government 
on 1 September 2010. The Special Rapporteur had not received a reply to that visit request. 
Nor did the Government respond to his communication of 1 February 2011 within 60 days 
as requested by the Special Rapporteur. In the absence of a response to his communication, 
the Special Rapporteur developed the observations below, which include an evaluation of 
the situation and recommendations, within the framework of relevant international 
standards. These observations were transmitted to the Government on 16 June 2011. 
Subsequently, the Government submitted a response on 15 August 2011.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of the information received and transmitted to the 
Government 
</b></p>
<p>2. According to the information received, the Bedouin have inhabited the area known 
as Negev since the seventh century, maintaining a semi-nomadic lifestyle, engaging in 
subsistence farming and raising livestock. Their land use practices were governed by an 
intricate system of customary land and water distribution and management. Allegedly, since 
1948 the State of Israel has failed to recognize Bedouin legal entitlement to their traditional 
lands in the Negev, and instead most all of the lands in the Negev are officially designated 
as under ownership by the State. Rather than adopt a land policy that recognizes the 
villages established by the Bedouin in the Negev, from the 1960s to the 1980s the 
Government planned and created seven towns in the Negev and relocated Bedouin from 
their villages to these urban areas. These planned towns are Rahat, Ar&#8217;ara BaNegev, Tel 
Sheva, Kuseifa, Segev Shalom, Lakiya and Hura. Even though the Government has 
committed significant resources toward Bedouin housing and delivery of essential services 
within the planned towns, the people in the Government-created towns reportedly rank at 
the bottom of all the indicators used by the State to measure social and economic wellbeing. 
Furthermore, the Bedouin have complained that they cannot continue to live in their 
traditional manner in these urban areas, given that raising crops or animals in the towns is 
not allowed.  
</p>
<p>3. Reportedly, out of approximately 155,000 Bedouin living in the Negev today, 
around half live in the recognized towns created by the Government and half live in 47 so-
called &#8220;unrecognized villages&#8221;. According to the information received, although officially 
unrecognized, the majority of these villages were established prior to the creation of the 
State of Israel, and virtually all were established prior to the creation of the Government-
created towns. The unrecognized villages are denied all forms of basic infrastructure and 
are not allowed to build or develop in any way. Building permits may not be issued in 
unrecognized villages, resulting in Bedouin individuals being indicted continually for 
</p>
<p><b>24</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;illegal&#8221; construction and in countless Bedouin homes being subject ot demolition orders. It 
is further alleged that, since the early 1990s, Bedouin people living in unrecognized villages 
throughout the Negev desert have experienced ongoing demolitions of their homes and 
villages by Israeli authorities. Most recently, during the course of 2010 and 2011, the Al-
Arakib (also spelled El-Arkib) village has been destroyed on nine occasions, after having 
been rebuilt by villagers following each demolition. Reportedly, the residents were given 
no notice or warning about the demolitions to retrieve their personal possessions and 
valuable items like gas stoves and water tanks. Their sources of livelihood &#8211; olive trees, 
poultry and sheep &#8211; were also destroyed. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>4. Having cross-checked the information received and transmitted on this situation, the 
Special Rapporteur considers that in material respects the information is sufficiently 
credible to indicate a pressing problem that requires attention by the Government of Israel. 
In an ongoing spirit of constructive dialogue and cooperation, the Special Rapporteur offers 
the following observations, which include a series of recommendations, in the hopes that 
they may assist the Government of Israel to address this issue.  
</p>
<p><i>  Duty to protect Bedouin rights to lands and resources in the Negev 
</i></p>
<p>5.  The Special Rapporteur considers there to be strong indications that Bedouin people 
have rights to certain areas of the Negev based on their longstanding land use and 
occupancy, under contemporary international standards. It is undisputed that the Bedouin 
have used and occupied lands within the Negev desert long before the establishment of the 
State of Israel and that they have continued through the present to inhabit the Negev, 
maintaining their culturally-distinctive land tenure and way of life. Yet, claims have 
persisted that the rights of the Bedouin to the lands they traditionally use and occupy in the 
Negev have not been adequately recognized and respected by the Government of Israel, 
either historically or today.  
</p>
<p>6. The land tenure situation of the Bedouin in the Negev has been identified as a matter 
of concern by both the Human Rights Committee, in its review of Israel&#8217;s compliance with 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights1, and by the Committee on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), in its review of Israel&#8217;s 
compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination2. In particular, the Human Rights Committee has stated that Israel &#8220;should 
respect the Bedouin population&#8217;s right to their ancestral land and their traditional livelihood 
based on agriculture&#8221; (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, para. 24) and similarly, CERD has 
recommended that Israel give &#8220;recognition of the rights of the Bedouins to own, develop, 
control and use their communal lands, territories and resources traditionally owned or 
otherwise inhabited or used by them&#8221; (CERD/C/ISR/CO/13, para. 25). 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur notes that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples sheds further light on the obligations of the State in relation to the 
Bedouin. The difficulties of the Bedouin in maintaining their distinct cultural identities and 
connections to their traditional lands are akin to the problems faced by indigenous peoples 
worldwide. The specific relevance of the Declaration, as evident by its terms, and of the 
various United Nations programs and mechanisms concerning indigenous peoples, 
including the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, is to 
</p>
<p>  
 1 CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, para. 24 (2010). 
 2 CERD/C/ISR/CO/13, para. 25 (2007). 
</p>
<p> <b>25 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>those groups indigenous to a territory that are in non-dominant positions and that have 
suffered and continue to suffer threats to their distinct identities and basic human rights, in 
ways not felt by dominant sectors of society.  
</p>
<p>8. Accordingly, with respect to Israel&#8217;s apparent failure to recognize and respect the 
rights of Bedouin to lands and resources in the Negev, it bears mentioning that the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms: 
</p>
<p><i> Article 26 
</i></p>
<p> 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources  which 
they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or  acquired. 
</p>
<p> 2. Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the  lands, 
territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional  ownership or other 
traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they  have otherwise acquired. 
</p>
<p> 3. States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories  and 
resources. Such recognition shall be conducted with due respect to the  customs, traditions 
and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples  concerned. 
</p>
<p>9. Further, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that there appears to be no effective 
land claim procedure for the Bedouin people to invoke, prior to their removal from lands 
they occupy or to the demolition of the unrecognized villages. The Special Rapporteur 
notes that, as provided by the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, States have 
an affirmative duty to establish a process for identifying and protecting indigenous land 
rights, and this process should be carried out in cooperation with the indigenous peoples 
concerned3. Given the failure of the State to establish a mechanism through which Bedouin 
may seek to have any existing rights to lands and resources recognized, Bedouin people 
appear to have been defenseless in the face of threats to their rights to lands and resource, 
threats that have materialized into the destruction of unrecognized Bedouin villages and 
forced removal of Bedouin people. 
</p>
<p><i>  Limitations on rights to lands and redress 
</i></p>
<p>10. Like other property interests, the property rights of indigenous peoples based on 
their traditional land and resource tenure may be subject to limitations for legitimate, non-
discriminatory public purposes in accordance with law. The Special Rapporteur would 
welcome information from the State of Israel about its justifications for the severe 
limitations on Bedouin land rights that are imposed by the demolitions of Bedouin villages. 
</p>
<p>11. According to the information the Special Rapporteur has received from other 
sources, possible explanations for the Government&#8217;s demolitions of unrecognized Bedouin 
villages include the need to concentrate the Bedouin people into recognized towns and 
settlements so as to assist in the delivery of services to them. Another reason identified for 
the demolitions is to clear the way for maintaining a Jewish presence throughout the Negev, 
in order to offset the high population growth of the Bedouin, which is one of the highest in 
the world. With respect to the first of these possible justifications, there are questions 
regarding the non-discriminatory application of this policy, since according to the 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Article 27 of the Declaration affirms that &#8220;States shall establish and implement, in conjunction with 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples concerned, a fair, independent, impartial, open and transparent process, giving 
due recognition to indigenous peoples&#8217; laws, traditions, customs and land tenure systems, to recognize 
and adjudicate the rights of indigenous peoples pertaining to their lands, territories and resources, 
including those which were traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used. Indigenous peoples 
shall have the right to participate in this process&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>26</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>information received Jewish settlements in the Negev are provided with essential services 
while Bedouin settlements of comparable sizes and populations are not. The second of 
these possible justifications &#8211; assisting in maintaining a Jewish presence in the Negev in 
order to offset the high population growth of the Bedouin &#8211; is racially discriminatory on its 
face, and thus, even if it were established by law, could not count as a legitimate limitation 
on Bedouin land rights that comports with relevant international standards. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur further notes that, while in general, removals of people from 
their traditional lands have serious implications for a wide range of human rights, these 
implications are greater for groups like the Bedouin, who hold bonds of deep historical and 
cultural significance to the lands in which they live. In this context, consent is a 
precondition for any forced removal according to article 10 of the United Nations 
Declaration, which states that &#8220;[i]ndigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from 
their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed 
consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair 
compensation and, where possible, with the option of return&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that some of the past relocations of 
Bedouin from unrecognized villages to urban townships were, in some instances, carried 
out in consultation with and with the consent of the affected Bedouin people. However, 
according to the information received, which the Special Rapporteur finds to be credible, 
there have been several more recent cases, including the case of the Al-Arakib village, in 
which consent of the affected Bedouin was clearly not obtained prior to the demolition of 
their village. 
</p>
<p>14. In any case, even if, after careful analysis bearing in mind the above standards, 
restriction of the rights to land and resources of Bedouin is considered an option, these 
restrictions should only take place with adequate mitigation measures and, in the case of 
any removals, with the agreement of the affected Bedouin within a participatory, 
consensus-building process, and the opportunity to return to their traditional lands. In this 
connection, article 28 of the Declaration affirms the right of indigenous peoples &#8220;to redress, 
which can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable 
compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned 
or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or 
damaged without their free, prior and informed consent&#8221;, and &#8220;[u]nless otherwise freely 
agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, 
territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation 
or other appropriate redress&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. In the cases that have been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, 
including the case of Al-Arakib, it is alleged that no alternative lands over which the 
Bedouin may continue their traditional ways of life have been set aside and no monetary 
compensation for the removals and the land loss has been provided. Moreover, a number of 
reports indicate that in the course of the forced removals, Bedouin have suffered the 
destruction of personal belongings and livestock, with no compensation.  
</p>
<p><i>  Recommendations 
</i></p>
<p>16. In light of the foregoing the Special Rapporteur would like to make the following 
recommendations to the Government of Israel: 
</p>
<p>17. The Government should ensure that all laws and administrative practices related to 
lands and development align with international standards concerning rights of indigenous 
people to lands, territories and resources. To this end, the Government should undertake a 
comprehensive review of its land and development policies that affect Bedouin people 
living in the Negev, giving due attention to the recommendations in relevant reports of the 
</p>
<p> <b>27 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. As part of this review, Israel should establish a mechanism to identify and 
protect the lands in the Negev over which Bedouin people have legal entitlement, in 
accordance with relevant international standards. 
</p>
<p>18. Israel should immediately cease to carry out any further demolitions of Bedouin 
villages in the Negev or any forced relocations of Bedouin from unrecognized villages to 
recognized townships, unless in consultation with affected Bedouin and pursuant to their 
free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>19. Israel should establish an adequate mechanism under which affected Bedouin can 
apply to receive redress for any restrictions to or infringements of their rights to lands and 
resources, including such restrictions or infringements resulting from demolitions and 
evictions carried out. Redress should include comparable alternative lands and monetary 
compensation for lands, resources and other property that have been lost, and the State 
should also provide the option of the return of groups to their traditional lands, at a future 
date, if possible and if they so desire. 
</p>
<p>20. Israel should ensure the delivery of essential services to Bedouin people, both within 
and outside of the recognized towns. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur supports 
and reiterates the recommendation of the Human Rights Committee that Israel should 
&#8220;guarantee the Bedouin population&#8217;s access to health structures, education, water and 
electricity, irrespective of their whereabouts on the territory of the State party&#8221; 
[(CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, para. 24 (2010)].  
</p>
<p>21. The Government should embrace a long-term vision for social and economic 
development of the Negev, including in the unrecognized Bedouin villages, bearing in mind 
the historical and cultural importance of these villages to the Bedouin and to the society at 
large. This long-term vision for development of the Negev should enable Bedouin to 
become active participants in and direct beneficiaries of any development initiatives 
affecting the lands the Bedouin traditionally use and occupy within the Negev. 
</p>
<p>22. These observations and recommendations represent only an initial assessment of this 
situation, and the Special Rapporteur would welcome the opportunity to maintain a 
continued dialogue with the Government of Israel in this regard. Therefore, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to reiterate his interest in carrying out an on-site visit to Israel to 
examine in greater detail the situation of the Bedouin in the Negev, in accordance with my 
mandate from the Human Rights Council to &#8220;examine ways and means of overcoming 
existing obstacles to the full and effective protection of the rights of indigenous peoples 
[&#8230;] and to identify, exchange and promote best practices&#8221; (HRC Res. 15/14).    
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Israel  
</b></p>
<p>23. In a letter dated 15 August 2011, the Government of Israel responded to the issues 
raised by the Special Rapporteur. The response was sent after the cut-off date for 
publication of government responses in the joint communications report of Special 
Procedures mandate holders. Therefore, the complete text of the letter will be available in 
the next joint report. With this in mind, the Special Rapporteur summarizes here the 
Government&#8217;s response. 
</p>
<p>According to the Government: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The State of Israel does not accept the classification of its Bedouin citizens as an 
indigenous people. Historically, Bedouin tribes arrived to the Negev area late in the 
Ottoman era, mainly from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to an already existing legal 
regime.  
</p>
<p><b>28</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Certain Bedouin families claim private ownership to vast lands, relying upon 
Bedouin custom. The land laws of the State of Israel, as developed from the 
Ottoman and British laws that preceded them do not recognize Bedouin custom as a 
source for private land rights. The area in question includes thousands of dunams, 
situated between Rahat and Beer Sheva. This is State land (&#8220;mawat&#8221;) according to 
Ottoman law, which was adopted during the British mandatory period and then 
absorbed into the laws of the State of Israel. As in other countries under the Ottoman 
and later British rule, private land transactions and claims of private ownership were 
subject to approval, acknowledgement and registration by government authorities. 
The Bedouins ignored these laws, for a variety of reasons, including economic 
considerations and a reluctance for making tax payments. Since the 1950s, the land 
has been held by Israel&#8217;s Development Authority and the Israel Lands 
Administration. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; After the foundation of the State of Israel, some areas of the Negev region were 
expropriated for housing, security and development needs, and have since been 
considered as public domain. The expropriated lands remain used for their initial 
stated purposes including housing and agriculture. Bedouin claims regarding land 
ownership were collected by Israel in the 1970s as part of a legal procedure that was 
carried out by the State. Unlike in other regions and despite a lack of legal 
documentation for Bedouins claims, the State has tried to settle claims beyond the 
letter of the law, offering compensation and alternative land plots in state organized 
localities. This policy accompanied the transition of the Bedouin society over the 
years from semi-nomadic to permanent housing. The nomadic lifestyle, as was 
practiced in the last century, no long exists, and does not seem to suit the current 
needs of the community.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The so-called El-Arkib village was simply an act of squatting on state owned land. 
The individuals never had ownership over this land. In the early 2000s, the Israel 
Lands Administration lawfully evicted the Bedouin families, but many individuals 
returned to the area without permission. This started a series of legal proceedings, 
held in three instances in including the Supreme Court, all of which ordered the 
Bedouin families to leave the area. The Israel Lands Administration continued to 
evict the families and they continued to return. Israel also offered the Bedouin 
families alternate agricultural lands at symbolic rates, but they refused and continued 
their illegal actions.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Israel has a long-existing policy of offering alternative living arrangements for those 
who live outside established localities. The State of Israel allocated a significant 
budget to offer constructive solutions to the housing, services and infrastructure 
needs of the Bedouin community. Further, Israel plans to build new localities 
suitable for the lifestyle and occupations of the Bedouin community.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The issue of the Bedouin settlement was recently examined by an independent 
public commission chaired by former Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg. The 
committee&#8217;s report, submitted in 2008, contained a range of options, particularly 
from its Bedouin representatives. At the time of the submission of the report, the 
government appointed an implementation team for the report, which is scheduled to 
present its conclusions in the near future. The Goldberg Report does not envisage to 
give land to the Bedouins in the area taken over by the squatters and does not 
propose to establish a town at the site. The report emphasizes the need to stop the 
illegal construction in the Negev immediately, and it charges the authorities with 
vigorous enforcement of the law against the illegal construction.

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1

<p><b>  Further observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Israel for its response of 15 
August 2011, although it comes well after the expiration of the time within which the 
Special Rapportuer had asked for responses to his earlier communications. The Special 
Rapporteur asked for a response to his initial communication of 1 February 2011 within 60 
days, and he invited submission by 18 July 2011 of any comments the Government may 
have to his above observations, which were transmitted to the Government on 16 June 
</p><p>2011. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s response, and he 
would like to comment on it as follows.  
</p>
<p>25. First, the Special Rapportuer acknowledges the position of the State of Israel that it 
does not accept the classification of its Bedouin citizens as an indigenous people given that 
Bedouin tribes arrived to the Negev area late in the Ottoman era, mainly from Saudi Arabia 
and Egypt, to an already existing legal regime. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, the 
longstanding presence of Bedouin people throughout a geographic region that includes 
Israel, and observes that in many respects, the Bedouin people share in the characteristics of 
indigenous peoples worldwide, including a connection to lands and the maintenance of 
cultural traditions that are distinct from those of majority populations. Further, the 
grievances of the Bedouin, stemming from their distinct cultural identities and their 
connection to their traditional lands, can be identified as representing the types of problems 
to which the international human rights regime related to indigenous peoples has been 
designed to respond. Thus, the Special Rapporteur considers that the concerns expressed by 
members of the Bedouin people are of relevance to his mandate and fall within the ambit of 
concern of the principles contained in international instruments such as the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>26. In addition, the Special Rapporteur cannot avoid making principled assessments 
about the scope of his mandate in relation to particular groups in the course of addressing 
human rights concerns that are brought to his attention. In this connection, consistent with 
the terms of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur cannot simply accept without independent 
inquiry general assertions that particular groups are not within his mandate. Nor does he 
consider that the question of whether or not a particular group is indigenous and related 
considerations can be left entirely to the subjective determination of States. The very 
human rights principles that undergird international concern for indigenous peoples, and an 
understanding about the context in which indigenous issues arise in connection with those 
principles, instead must guide assessments of this type. The Special Rapporteur hopes that 
the Government of Israel will reconsider its position in this regard and that, in any event, it 
will work diligently toward ensuring full and adequate responses to the human rights issues 
raised regarding the situation of the Bedouin people in the Negev. 
</p>
<p>27. Second, the Special Rapporteur would like to respond to Israel&#8217;s position that 
Bedouin people do not have customary rights to lands in the Negev given that the land laws 
of the State of Israel, as developed from the Ottoman and British laws that preceded them, 
do not recognize Bedouin custom as a source of private land rights. In the view of the 
Special Rapporteur, such a position, which is based in colonial era laws and policies, should 
be reviewed. Far from providing a justification for the current failure to recognize 
indigenous peoples&#8217; land rights based on their customs, the historical denial of these rights 
and the dispossession of indigenous peoples from their traditional lands are acts that are 
now understood to be inconsistent with international human rights standards. In this regard, 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples specifically requires 
that States must provide &#8220;redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not 
possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which 
they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been 
confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p><b>30</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>consent&#8221; (article 28). Finally, the Special Rapporteur does recognize the need for an orderly 
administration of land and a respect for the rule of law. However, legal and administrative 
policies related to land must also be consistent with international human rights standards 
and accordingly must also be adjusted where they fall short of those standards. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur reaffirms the recommendations made in the above 
observations, and he will continue to monitor the situation of the Bedouin in the Negev as 
appropriate.

<p><b>Annex VII 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Malaysia: Situation of the Long Teran Kanan village and 
native customary rights in Sarawak  
</b></p>
<p>  MYS 3/2011 
</p>
<p>1. In a communication of 18 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, together with the Special Rapporteur on the Right to 
Food, Olivier de Schutter, transmitted to the Government of Malaysia information they 
received related to the situation of the Long Teran Kanan community and the alleged 
failure of the Government to recognize and respect native customary rights in Sarawak and, 
consequently, the infringement of a range of human rights.  
</p>
<p>2. This communication took place alongside the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s ongoing 
communications with the Government of Malaysia regarding a potential visit to the 
country. On 4 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur wrote the Government expressing his 
interest in carrying out a visit to the country. On 24 May 2011, he sent a follow-up letter 
describing the specific issues he be interested in examining during such a visit. As the 
Special Rapporteur noted in that letter, he would be interested in looking at issues related to 
land and development affecting indigenous peoples, and examine potential ways for 
harmonizing competing interests in this connection, in accordance with relevant 
international human rights standards related to indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>3. Although as of time this report was finalized the Special Rapporteur had not 
received a definitive response to his request for a visit, the Government did respond to the 
communication of 18 February 2011. The Government submitted its response by a note 
dated 15 July 2011. The full text of this note and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication 
to which it responds can be accessed from the electronic version of the joint 
communications report (A/HRC/18/51), which is available on the web site of the Human 
Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>4. Prior to receiving the response of the Government of Malaysia of 15 July 2011, and 
in the absence of a response to his communication of 18 February 2011 within 60 days as 
requested, the Special Rapporteur developed observations on the situation, which he 
transmitted to the Government on 29 June 2011. In its response of 15 July 2011 the 
Government did not specifically address the observations transmitted on 29 June 2011, but 
rather directed its comments at the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s earlier communication of 18 
February 2011. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Malaysia 
for its response and for the clarifications it made, especially in relation to the case of the 
Long Teran Kanan community. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur notes that the 
observations he transmitted to the Government on 29 June 2011 continue to be relevant, 
and he reiterates those observations below, with some modifications made in light of the 
Government&#8217;s response. By way of background, the Special Rapporteur first provides 
summaries of the information and allegations received in this matter and of the 
Government&#8217;s response. 
</p>
<p><b>   Summary of information received and transmitted to the Government 
on 18 February 2011 
</b></p>
<p>5. According to the information received, the Kayan indigenous community of the 
Long Teran Kanan village in Tinjar, Miri, in the state of Sarawak, has been involved in a 
legal dispute over its land for the past 12 years, which resulted in the Miri High Court 
</p>
<p><b>32</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>ruling in favour of the community on 31 March 2010. The Special Rapporteur understands 
that, in its decision, the Court affirmed the village&#8217;s &#8220;native customary rights over their 
native customary lands&#8221; and held that the provisional leases issued within the area by the 
Sarawak Government to the Land Custody Development Authority and IOI Pelita 
Plantation Sdn. Bhd., all of whom were named as defendants in the case, were null and 
void. The Court further found that the rights of the Long Teran Kanan community under 
Article 5 (right to life) and Article 13 (right to property) of the Federal Constitution of 
Malaysia had been violated. 
</p>
<p>6. Nevertheless, IOI Pelita Plantation Sdn. Bhd. has reportedly appealed the judgment 
and has allegedly not respected the Court order in the interim, continuing palm oil 
operations in the Long Teran Kanan community. As a result of the continued presence of 
IOI Pelita Plantation in the area, community members reportedly have limited to no access 
to the lands that they traditional have used for agriculture and other subsistence activities. 
Allegedly, the village&#8217;s crops have been bulldozed and planted with oil palms, destroying 
the Kayan people&#8217;s traditional livelihoods and forcing them to purchase food, medicine and 
wood that they previously collected from their community lands. Moreover, most of the 
communitiy&#8217;s former water catchment area has been cleared and planted with oil palms by 
the company, thereby depleting available water sources.  
</p>
<p>7. Allegations have also been raised regarding the implementation of the Government&#8217;s 
&#8220;New Concept&#8221; policy announced in 1994, under which native customary communities are 
to receive 30 per cent of equity in development projects in exchange for a 60-year lease on 
their lands. Reportedly, native customary communities in Sarawak have not received the 
benefits to which they are entitled. Moreover, the manner in which communities&#8217; consent 
has been obtained for the transfer of land for various development activies in Sarawak has 
reportedly been problematic. For example, in a number of cases, agreement for surrender of 
land and native customary rights has allegedly been obtained by only the village chief 
signing an agreement with companies, without the knowedge of the broader community. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that the case of the Kayan indigenous 
community of the Long Teran Kanan village is emblematic of the over 200 cases currently 
before the Sarawak courts relating to indigenous communities&#8217; ability to exercise their 
native customary right over their lands, upon which they depend for fishing, hunting or 
farming, and which are essential to their cultural survival. Despite the fact that the courts of 
Malaysia have upheld native peoples&#8217; customary right to land under the Constitution of 
Malaysia and the common law on several occasions, the Government of Sarawak has 
allegedly failed to implement these decisions and has failed to respect indigenous 
communities&#8217; customary rights to land in other cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of response of the Government of Malaysia of 15 July 2011  
</b></p>
<p>9. With respect to the Long Teran Kenan community, the Government noted that the 
information received by the Special Rapporteurs was not entirely accurate. The 
Government reported that, while the High Court of Miri did affirm that the Long Teran 
Kanan community has native customary rights over the area in dispute, it also held that it 
would not be practical to ask the government of the state of Sarawak to cancel the leases 
that have been issued to IOI Pelita Plantation. Thus, the court granted the Long Teran 
Kanan damages instead. The Government reported that on 28 April 2010, both IOI Pelita 
Plantation and the state of Sarawak appealed the case to the court of appeal. The court of 
appeal had not yet heard the matter. Furthermore, on 22 March 2011 the High Court of Miri 
granted an injunction against the Long Teran Kanan community, restraining it from 
preventing the IOI Pelita Plantation from entering the concession area and from carrying 
out its palm oil activities.  
</p>
<p> <b>33 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Government response also addressed issues related to consultation and consent 
regarding development activities within native customary lands in Sarawak and issues 
related to the sharing of benefits derived from those activities. Malaysia refuted the 
allegation that a native customary community&#8217;s rights could be relinquished by the 
signature of one member of the community. The Government also clarified that only those 
native customary communities wishing to participate in the New Concept scheme in 
Sarawak are required to do so. Further, the Government refuted the allegation that 
indigenous peoples have been denied benefits under the New Concept scheme. Native 
customary landowners participating in the New Concept scheme have derived both 
financial benefits and benefits such as improved roads and heightened access to hospitals 
and schools.  
</p>
<p>11. Malaysia reported that both the Federal Constitution and the laws of Sarawak 
prohibit the compulsory acquisition or use of the land without compensation. Finally, the 
Government concluded by affirming that it has taken measures to give due respect to the 
judicial judgments in court cases involving indigenous communities and their native 
customary rights over land under the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, the laws of the state 
of Sarawak and other laws.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>12. Malaysia should be recognized for its longstanding legal protection of native 
customary rights to land, both by statute, including the Sarawak Land Code, and in 
jurisprudence of Malaysia courts.1 In the view of the Special Rapporteur, this legal 
framework, in particular the jurisprudence of Malaysia courts, is to a large extent in line 
with Article 26 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
which was adopted by the General Assembly in September 2007, with an affirmative vote 
by Malaysia, and which states: 
</p>
<p><i> Article 26 
</i></p>
<p> 1. Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources  which 
they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or  acquired. 
</p>
<p> 2. Indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop and control the  lands, 
territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional  ownership or other 
traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they  have otherwise acquired. 
</p>
<p> 3. States shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories  and 
resources. Such recognition shall be conducted with due respect to the  customs, traditions 
and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples  concerned. 
</p>
<p>13. Yet, from the information the Special Rapporteur has received regarding the 
situation of the Long Teran Kanan community and in the state of Sarawak in general, the 
Special Rapporteur  observes that it is not uncommon for the protection of native customary 
rights to give way to competing interests over those same lands, including in relation to 
natural resourse extraction projects, especially forestry and palm oil activities. Further, it 
appears that, too often, political forces seek to undermine protections of native customary 
lands, in many cases for personal or political motives.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 See, e.g., <i>Adong bin Kuwau v. Kerajaan Negeri Johor</i> [1997] 1 MLJ 418; <i>Kerajaan Negri Johor &amp; 
</i></p>
<p><i>Anor v Adong bin Kuwau &amp; Ors</i> [1998] 2 MLJ 158; and <i>Sagong bin Tasi &amp; Ors v Kerajaan Negeri 
Selangor &amp; Ors</i> [2002] 2 MLJ 591. 
</p>
<p><b>34</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>14. In general, the information that the Special Rapporteur has received also indicates 
that there is not an adequate mechanism of consultation with indigenous peoples affected 
by major development projects. According to numerous reports, with regard to many such 
projects, consultations have not taken place directly with the affected indigenous peoples 
through their own representative institutions, prior to approval of the projects and with the 
objective of achieving informed consent, as required the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples (Arts. 19, 32.2).  
</p>
<p>15. As highlighted in the case of the Long Teran Kanan village, adding to these 
challenges with respect to native customary rights in Sarawak is the apparent absence of 
adequate mechanism of participation of indigenous peoples in the design and 
implementation of the development initiatives, the absence of adequate mitigation measures 
that take into account indigenous environmental and cultural concerns, and the absence of 
equitable sharing in the benefits of the development projects. The Special Rapporteur 
would like to note that Article 32 of the Declaration, with its call for the free prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples and measures of redress, provides an important 
template for avoiding these problems and for the possibility of such economic and 
infrastructure development projects to not just avoid harm to indigenous peoples but to 
advance their own development interests along with those of the larger society. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rappoteur understands that an in-depth inquiry into the situation of 
native customary rights to land, including the situation in Sarawak, is currently being 
undertaken by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM). The Special 
Rapporteur expects that this study will also include a concerted investigation of the 
practices of government entities at all levels in issuing concessions for natural resource 
extraction projects in lands over which indigenous communities have native customary 
rights, with a view towards documenting potential irregularities in these practices and 
analyzing their compliance with national and international standards.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this initiative by SUHAKAM and belives that it 
will be an important point of reference for the future task of fully harmonizing government 
laws, policies and initiatives for economic development with those that provide recognition 
and protection of the land and resource rights, and related rights, of indigenous peoples. 
The Special Rapporteur looks forward to examining the results of SUHAKAM&#8217;s inquiry, 
and would like to offer assistance to the Government of Malaysia in connection with this 
process and future processes, if it would be deemed useful.

del reglamento de la Ley de Miner&#237;a, los cuales fueron debidamente acatados por las 
empresas involucradas.

actividades mineras de First Majestic en la regi&#243;n de Wirikuta y sus efectos, el Gobierno 
not&#243; que el 13 de diciembre de 2010, en el Municipio de Real de Catorce, el representante

<p>5. El Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que la empresa no ha realizado actividades en la zona de 
Wirikuta, y que la empresa todav&#237;a no cuenta con todos los permisos administrativos 
necesarios para tal fin. Como parte del procedimiento de procuraci&#243;n de los permisos 
necesarios para el inicio de actividades mineras, varias leyes y reglamentos en M&#233;xico y en 
el estado de San Luis Potos&#237; requieren el desarrollo de participaci&#243;n ciudadana y la consulta 
con pueblos ind&#237;genas afectados. En particular, el estado de San Luis Potos&#237; cuenta con una 
Ley de Consulta Ind&#237;gena, que establece en su art&#237;culo 9 que el estado tiene la obligaci&#243;n de 
consultar con los pueblos ind&#237;genas &#8220;el otorgamiento de concesiones, contratos, y dem&#225;s

mayo de 2011, seg&#250;n el Gobierno, los representantes del pueblo wix&#225;rika aceptaron el 
ofrecimiento institucional para la protecci&#243;n de sus lugares sagrados. Finalmente, el 
Gobierno hizo un resumen del marco jur&#237;dico mexicano respecto a las concesiones mineras.

<p>9. La creaci&#243;n de la Reserva Ecol&#243;gica y Cultural Wirikuta para proteger la ruta de la 
peregrinaci&#243;n wix&#225;rika y sus sitios sagrados refleja el reconocimiento por el Gobierno de 
M&#233;xico de la importancia de esta zona para la cultura wix&#225;rika, y de la necesidad de 
preservar el ecosistema de la zona. El Relator Especial considera, de hecho, que la Reserva 
Ecol&#243;gica y Cultural Wirikuta pudiera representar un modelo ejemplar para garantizar el 
derecho de los pueblos ind&#237;genas &#8220;a mantener y fortalecer su propia relaci&#243;n espiritual con 
las tierras &#8230; que tradicionalmente han pose&#237;do u ocupado y utilizado de otra forma y a 
asumir las responsabilidades que a ese respecto les incumben para con las generaciones 
venideras&#8221;, de acuerdo con el art&#237;culo 25 de la Declaraci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas sobre 
los Derechos de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas. 
</p>
<p>10. A pesar de lo anterior, la respuesta del Gobierno de M&#233;xico indica que el Estado 
todav&#237;a no ha elaborado un estudio sobre los efectos de las propuestas actividades mineras 
en Real de Catorce sobre la Reserva Ecol&#243;gica y Cultural Wirikuta, aunque un porcentaje 
significativo del &#225;rea concesionada est&#225; dentro de la reserva. En este sentido, es necesario, 
de acuerdo con el art&#237;culo 7 del Convenio No. 169 de la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional de 
Trabajo sobre pueblos ind&#237;genas y tribales en pa&#237;ses independientes, ratificado por M&#233;xico 
en 1991, que el Estado efect&#250;e &#8220;estudios, en cooperaci&#243;n con los pueblos interesados, a fin 
de evaluar la incidencia social, espiritual y cultural y sobre el medio ambiente&#8221; de las 
concesiones mineras otorgadas en la Reserva Ecol&#243;gica y Cultural Wirikuta. 
</p>
<p>11. Asimismo, el Relator Especial considera que es sumamente importante mantener 
continuamente espacios de acercamiento y di&#225;logo entre los representantes del Gobierno, la 
empresa First Majestic y el pueblo wix&#225;rika, en el que los pueblos ind&#237;genas puedan recibir 
informaci&#243;n objetiva y completa sobre todos los aspectos del proyecto que les podr&#237;a 
afectar, y donde puedan aclarar y comunicar al Estado y a la empresa sus preocupaciones al 
respecto. Dentro de estos espacios, se debe buscar formas de evitar cualquier efecto 
perjudicial por parte de las posibles actividades de exploraci&#243;n y explotaci&#243;n minera sobre 
el &#225;rea sagrada de los wix&#225;rika.  
</p>
<p>12. En esta conexi&#243;n, el Relator Especial toma nota de la reuni&#243;n llevada a cabo por la 
empresa el 13 de diciembre de 2010 para proporcionar informaci&#243;n sobre el proyecto 
minero al Consejo de Administraci&#243;n del Sitio Sagrado Natural de Wirikuta y la Ruta 
Hist&#243;rico Cultural del pueblo Wix&#225;rika. Adem&#225;s, el Relator Especial agradece la 
informaci&#243;n del Gobierno sobre la intenci&#243;n de llevar a cabo consultas con el pueblo 
wix&#225;rika como parte del procedimiento de procuraci&#243;n de los permisos pendientes de 
explotaci&#243;n minera.  
</p>
<p>13. El Relator Especial hace recordar al Estado lo dispuesto en el art&#237;culo 19 de la 
Declaraci&#243;n sobre los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, seg&#250;n el cual el di&#225;logo con el 
pueblo wix&#225;rika sobre las actividades mineras que les puedan afectar deber&#237;a sostenerse con 
el objetivo de &#8220;obtener su consentimiento libre, previo e informado&#8221;. El Relator Especial 
espera que el Gobierno pudiera coincidir en la opini&#243;n de que, si no se lograra el 
consentimiento de los wix&#225;rika al respecto, y fuese determinado que las actividades 
propuestas no pudieran desarrollarse de manera compatible con el conjunto los derechos 
relevantes del pueblo wix&#225;rika, no se deber&#237;a avanzar con las actividades mineras.  
</p>
<p>14. Al respecto se deber&#237;a prestar especial atenci&#243;n a su derecho a mantener y 
desarrollar sus creencias religiosas de acuerdo a la Declaraci&#243;n sobre los derechos de los 
pueblos ind&#237;genas, la cual dispone en su art&#237;culo 18 que &#8220;Los pueblos ind&#237;genas tienen 
derecho a manifestar, practicar, desarrollar y ense&#241;ar sus tradiciones, costumbres y 
ceremonias espirituales y religiosas&#8230;&#8221; Adem&#225;s, el art&#237;culo 25 de la Declaraci&#243;n afirma el 
derecho de los pueblos ind&#237;genas &#8220;a mantener y fortalecer su propia relaci&#243;n espiritual con 
</p>
<p><b>38</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1

<p>las tierras, territorios, aguas, mares costeros y otros recursos que tradicionalmente han 
pose&#237;do u ocupado y utilizado de otra forma y a asumir las responsabilidades que a ese 
respecto les incumben para con las generaciones venideras&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. Es la intenci&#243;n del Relator Especial seguir monitoreando esta situaci&#243;n y quisiera 
reiterar su deseo de continuar manteniendo un di&#225;logo constructivo con el Gobierno de 
M&#233;xico en este sentido. Quisiera asimismo expresar su disponibilidad de asistir a las partes 
en la b&#250;squeda de medidas para evitar violaciones de los derechos de los pueblos ind&#237;genas 
en este caso, incluyendo a trav&#233;s de una visita <i>in situ</i> a la zona, si el Gobierno y las otras 
partes involucradas lo estimaran pertinente.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Thailand: Exhumation of Hmong Graves at Wat Tham 
Krabok  
</b></p>
<p>  THA 8/2010 
</p>
<p>1. In a communication of 17 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, called the attention of the Government of Thailand to 
information received relating to the situation of the exhumation of Hmong graves at Wat 
Tham Krabok which occurred in 2005. This matter has been the subject of ongoing 
communications with the Government of Thailand, as reflected in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
2008 and 2009 annual reports to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/9/9/Add.1, paras. 473-
479; and A/HRC/12/34/Add.1, paras. 404-429). In the absence of a response to his 
communication of 17 December 2010 within 60 days as requested, the Special Rapporteur 
sent another letter, dated 16 June 2011, in which he reiterated his concerns about the 
situation and again invited the Government to respond to specific recommendations. 
Subsequently, by a note dated 11 July 2011, the Government of Thailand responded to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications. The full texts of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
communication of 17 December 2010 and the Government&#8217;s response can be accessed from 
the electronic version of the joint communications report (A/HRC/18/51), which is 
available on the web site of the Human Rights Council.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s follow-up to earlier communications about 
the situation  
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letters of 17 December 2010 and 16 June 2010 follow up 
to earlier communications about the exhumation of Hmong graves at Wat Tham Krabok in 
2005 and resulting grievances of Hmong relatives of the deceased. As expressed in 
previous communications, questions exist about the reasons for the exhumation of Hmong 
graves that occurred at Wat Tham Krabok as well as the level of the involvement of the 
Government of Thailand in the exhumations. In addition, ongoing information has been 
received about the continued harm felt by the relatives of the deceased and the absence of 
any action by the Government to remedy that harm. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. According to information received, Hmong groups have repeatedly sent delegations 
to dialogue with Government officials in order to achieve a resolution of the pending issues 
concerning the return of exhumed bodies. The relatives of the deceased Hmong and 
members of the Hmong communities worldwide have made specific requests to the 
Government of Thailand and Thai foundations in possession of the remains of the exhumed 
bodies for what they would consider to be an acceptable solution to their grievances.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>These requests include that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The three Thai foundations (Phothi Phavan Songkhao, Buddha Dahma and Wat 
Thamkrabok) return three petrified bodies they are holding to the relatives of the 
deceased without cost;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The three Thai foundations return the 691 bodies that were confirmed by the Thai 
Ministry of the Interior to have been exhumed, at no cost. This figure includes 211 
bodies currently in Huilin Cemetery and another 480 bodies that were originally 
falsely reported to have been cremated;  
</p>
<p><b>40</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The Government of Thailand and the authorities of Wat Tham Krabok allow the 
reburial of the 691 exhumed bodies at the original temple site at no cost; and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government of Thailand establishes a memorial park and a monument at Wat 
Tham Krabok to commemorate the Hmong buried there.  
</p>
<p>4. In his letters of 17 December 2010 and 16 June 2011 the Special Rapporteur referred 
to these requests and urged the Government to give them special consideration, within a 
process of dialogue with Hmong representatives aimed at resolving this situation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of Thailand 
</b></p>
<p>5. In its response to the latest communications of the Special Rapporteur regarding the 
exhumation of Hmong graves in Wat Tham Krabok, the Government stated that, in 
principle, Thailand does not have any indigenous people. The Government went on to state, 
however, that given the importance Thailand attaches to cooperation with the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council, it appreciates the ongoing efforts of the Special 
Rapporteur to enegage with the Royal Thai Government and his willingness to help in the 
resolution of the matter.  
</p>
<p>6. The Government stated that the facts and position of the Royal Thai Government 
have been explained in its previous Note No. 21010/497 dated 9 July 2008 and Note No. 
52101/884 dated 17 December 2008. Summaries of these letters can be found in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s previous reports to the Human Rights Council on cases examined 
(A/HRC/9/9/Add.1, paras. 475-478; and A/HRC/12/34.Add.1, paras. 406, 407, 409). In its 
letter of 11 July 2011 the Government reiterated points it had made on those previous 
letters, specifically that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Laotian Hmongs had migrated from Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic to Thailand 
only from 2003 and thus could not be considered as indigenous people. They were 
allowed to take refuge in Wat Tham Krabok, a Buddhist Monastery in Saraburi 
Province, only for humanitarian reasons.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under Thai law, the management of Buddhist monasteries is under the authority of 
an abbot. The Hmong buried their deceased relatives on the monastery grounds 
without any permission from the abbot or the administrative committee of Wat 
Tham Krabok.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; When the monastery decided to convert parts of its land into a place for various 
religious facilities, the relatives of those Hmong buried at Wat Tham Krabok were 
informed in advance of the necessity to relocate he graves from the monastery 
grounds. Some Hmong came to reclaim their relatives&#8217; bodies for relocation. 
Additionally, representatives of the Hmong community had given their consent to 
the monastery to proceed with the relocation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consequently, unclaimed bodies were exhumed and provided with a public 
cremation ceremony with full respect of the deceased as well as consideration for 
their families. In accordance with Buddhist practices, this mass grave exhumation 
and cremation ceremony were accompanied by rituals to honor the deceased. 
</p>
<p>7. The Government further stated that, although there was no official involvement in 
the exhumation of Hmong graves in Wat Tham Krabok, in July 2008, the National Hmong 
Grave Desecration Committee (NHGDC) from the United States had a meeting with the 
government authority of Saraburi Province and later in August 2009, representatives of the 
NHGDC revisited Thailand to meet with Hmong peoples residing in various areas. The 
Government expressed its hope that these dialogues would serve to address the concerns 
expressed by the Hmong families. 
</p>
<p> <b>41 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response provided by the Government of 
Thailand to previous communications. Notwithstanding the assertions by the Government 
that no indigenous peoples exist in Thailand and previous assertions by the Government 
that the Hmong that were present at Wat Tham Krabok were originally refugees from Laos, 
the Special Rapporteur notes the longstanding presence of Hmong people throughout 
southeast Asia, including Thailand, and observes that in many respects the Hmong share 
characteristics similar to indigenous peoples worldwide, including their maintenance of 
cultural and religious traditions that are distinct from those of the majority. Therefore, the 
concerns expressed by members of the affected Hmong people are of relevance to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate and fall within the ambit of concern of the principles 
contained in international instruments such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his recommendation that the 
Government of Thailand engage in a dialogue with the affected Hmong in order to resolve 
the situation, and takes note of the Government&#8217;s information that it has held meetings with 
the National Hmong Grave Desecration towards this end. He again urges the Government 
to consider the proposals set out by the Hmong people, mindful of their cultural and 
spiritual views regarding their deceased with the view to restore a positive relationship with 
the Hmong. The Special Rapporteur will continue to monitor this situation as appropriate.

<p><b>Annex X 
</b></p>
<p><b>  United States of America: Situation of the Native Americans 
in relation to artificial snowmaking from recycled wastewater 
in the San Francisco Peaks  
</b></p>
<p>  USA 1/2011 
</p>
<p>1. In a communication of 10 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples, James Anaya, called the attention of the Government of the United 
States of America to information received relating to the proposed use of recycled 
wastewater for a commercial ski operation the San Francisco Peaks (or the &#8220;Peaks&#8221;), a 
mountainous area that is sacred to several Native American tribes. The full text of this 
communication can be accessed from the electronic version of the joint communications 
report (A/HRC/18/51), which is available on the web site of the Human Rights Council. In 
his communication the Special Rapporteur requested a response within 60 days. He regrets 
that there is no record of a response in the files of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights at the time of finalization of this report. In the absence of a response, the 
Special Rapporteur developed the observations below, which include an evaluation of the 
situation and recommendations to the Government of the United States. These observations 
were transmitted to the Government on 6 July 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. The San Francisco Peaks are located north of the city of Flagstaff, Arizona within 
land that is administered by the United States Forest Service as part of the Coconino 
National Forest. According to information received, the Arizona Snowbowl Resort Limited 
Partnership (&#8220;Snowbowl&#8221;) owns and operates a commercial ski operation in the western 
flank of the San Francisco Peaks, under a 777-acre special use permit issued by the Forest 
Service. In 2002 Snowbowl filed an application for expansion of its facilities, including a 
request for approval to make snow from treated sewage effluent. In February 2005, the 
Forest Service issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision 
approving the proposed artificial snowmaking from recycled waste wastewater, the 
construction of a pipeline from Flagstaff to carry the treated effluent from Flagstaff and 
improvement of guest service facilities. Several Native American tribes and organizations 
have vigorously opposed the Forest Service&#8217;s decision. To them, according to sources, the 
sacredness of the San Francisco Peaks depends on the purity of the water and plant life in 
the area, which allegedly will be contaminated if wastewater is introduced into the Peaks 
through the planned artificial snowmaking. However, their federal court lawsuit to 
challenge the approval of artificial snowmaking on, inter alia, religious freedom grounds 
was unsuccessful.1
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>3. On the basis of information he has received and gathered on this situation, which he 
considers to be in material respects undisputed, the Special Rapporteur offers the following 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See <i>Navajo Nation v. United States Forest Service</i>, 535 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 
</p>
<p>S.Ct. 2763 (2009). 
</p>
<p> <b>43 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>observations, in the hope that they will serve to promote appropriate action by the United 
States to address the human rights matters raised. 
</p>
<p>4. The extensive documentation by the Government and federal courts in relevant 
proceedings makes clear that the San Francisco Peaks are sacred to several Native 
American tribes, and that the presence of the ski operation and now the initiative to make 
artificial snow from recycled wastewater on the Peaks offend the religious beliefs and 
practices of members of these tribes. Apart from the provisions of domestic law that have 
been applied by the courts to examine this situation, international standards, including those 
based on human rights treaties to which the United States is a party to and the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, require adequate consultation and close scrutiny for 
any action that affects the sacred sites and religious practices of indigenous peoples. The 
United States should engage in a comprehensive review of its relevant policies and actions 
to ensure that they are in compliance with these international standards in relation to the 
San Francisco Peaks and other sacred sites of Native Americans, and should take 
appropriate remedial action. In the paragraphs below, the Special Rapporteur elaborates 
upon these points. 
</p>
<p><i>  The effects of the planned snowmaking on Native American religion 
</i></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is aware that the development of the Snowbowl ski area and 
the recent plans for expanding its facilities, including for artificial snowmaking with 
recycled wastewater, have proceeded with extensive examination and documentation by the 
Government and federal courts of the impacts on Native American culture and religion. 
Required environmental impact studies and the legal challenges to the federal permits for 
Snowbowl&#8217;s expansion on the San Francisco Peaks have prompted this examination and 
documentation, which make abundantly clear the sacred character of the Peaks to the tribes, 
the affront on their religious beliefs and the tribes&#8217; opposition to the planned snowmaking.  </p>
<p>6. The Final Environmental Impact Statement compiled by the U.S. Forest Service to 
assess the proposal for artificial snowmaking and other additions to Snowbowl&#8217;s operations 
on the Peaks included the following observations:  
</p>
<p> The San Francisco Peaks are sacred to at least 13 formally recognized tribes that are 
 still actively using the Peaks in cultural, historic, and religious contexts. A central 
 underlying concept to all tribes for whom the Peaks are especially important is the 
 recognition that the San Francisco Peaks are a source of water in the form of rain, 
 springs, and snow. It is believed that the Peaks were put there for the people and it is 
 therefore the peoples&#8217; duty to protect it for the benefit of the world&#8230; [N]ine 
 significant qualities&#8230; characterize the Peaks for the tribes. These qualities include: </p>
<p>&#8226;  They are the abode of deities and other spirit beings. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  They are the focus of prayers and songs whereby humans  
   communicate with the supernatural. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  They contain shrines and other places where ceremonies and prayers 
   are performed. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  They are the source of water. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  They are the source of soil, plant, and animal resources that are used 
   for ceremonial and traditional purposes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  They mark the boundaries of traditional or ancestral lands. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  They form a calendar that is used to delineate and recognize the 
   ceremonial season. 
</p>
<p><b>44</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226;  They contain places that relate to legends and stories concerning the 
   origins, clans, traditions, and ceremonies of various Southwestern 
   tribes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; They contain sites and places that are significant in the history and 
   culture of various tribes. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> Two examples of the cultural significance of the San Francisco Peaks are the Hopi 
 and Navajo peoples&#8217; religious and spiritual connections to the Peaks, as discussed 
 below. 
</p>
<p>  Hopi 
 Hopi clans migrated through the San Francisco Peaks (called <i>Nuvatukyaovi</i>, &#8220;High 
 Place of Snow&#8221;), made settlements nearby, and placed shrines on the Peaks. All of 
 the religious ceremonies focus on <i>Nuvatukyaovi </i>and demonstrate the sacred 
 relationship of the Peaks to the Hopi people. The history of clan migrations through 
 the area continue to be related, discussed, and passed on from generation to 
 generation. The Peaks contain clan and society shrines, and gathering areas for 
 medicinal and religious use. Hopi religious leaders visit the Peaks annually. The San 
 Francisco Peaks are the spiritual essence of what Hopis consider the most sacred 
 landscapes in Hopi religion. They are the spiritual home of the <i>Katsinam</i>, significant 
 religious beings that all Hopis believe in, and are therefore, sacred. The ceremonies 
 associated with the Peaks, the plants and herbs gathered on the Peaks, and the 
 shrines and ancestral dwellings located in the vicinity of the Peaks are of central 
 importance to the religious beliefs and traditions that are the core of Hopi culture.... 
</p>
<p>  Navajo 
 The Navajo people believe that the Creator placed them on land between four sacred 
 mountains: Blanca Peak in Colorado, Mount Taylor in New Mexico, the San 
 Francisco Peaks in Arizona, and Hesperus Peak in Colorado. According to their own 
 history, the Navajos have always lived between these mountains. Each of the four 
 mountains is associated with a cardinal direction, symbolizing the boundaries of the 
 Navajo homeland. For the Navajo, the Peaks are the sacred mountain of the west, 
 <i>Doko&#8217;oo&#8217;sliid, </i>&#8220;Shining on Top,&#8221; a key boundary marker and a place where 
 medicine men collect soil for their medicine bundles and herbs for healing 
 ceremonies. Navajo traditions tell that San Francisco Peak was adorned with 
 <i>Diichil&#237;</i>, Abalone Shell, Black Clouds, Male Rain, and all animals, besides being the 
 home of <i>Haashch&#8217;&#233;&#233;lt&#8217;i&#8217;&#237; </i>(Talking God), <i>Naada&#8217;algaii &#8216;Ashkii </i>(White Corn Boy), 
 and <i>Naad&#225; &#8216;Altsoii &#8216;At&#8217;&#233;&#233;d </i>(Yellow Corn Girl). The sacred name of the Peaks is 
 <i>Diichil&#237; Dzil </i>&#8211; (Abalone Shell Mountain). The Navajo people have been instructed 
 by the Creator never to leave their sacred homeland. <i>Dook&#8217;o&#8217;osliid </i>and the other 
 three sacred mountains are the source of curing powers. They are perceived as a 
 single unit, such as the wall of a hogan, or as a particular time of a single day. 
 <i>Dook&#8217;o&#8217;osliid </i>is seen as a wall made of abalone shell and stone, with mixed yellow 
 and white bands.... 
</p>
<p>  Environmental Consequences 
 The 1975 Hopi Tribal Resolution noted that there are numerous medicinal herbs and 
 other plants at several levels of the Peaks that are used to treat the ailments of the 
 Hopi people. The Forest Service is unaware of any plants or other natural resource 
 material used by the Hopi within the Snowbowl &#8230; area; however, the addition of 
 new trails, increased parking, and the potential for additional annual visitation within 
 the &#8230; area and the San Francisco Peak themselves causes concern among the Hopi 
 and other tribes that their areas of traditional use would be impacted. Specifically, 
</p>
<p> <b>45 </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> the Hopi make pilgrimages to shrines and use the Peaks for religious reasons such as 
 gathering evergreens and herbs and delivering prayer feathers. 
</p>
<p> Although the reclaimed water proposed for use in snowmaking fully meets both the 
 Federal and Arizona state water quality standards, it is believed that trace levels of 
 unregulated residual constituents within reclaimed water (e.g., pathogens, 
 pharmaceuticals, hormones, etc.) could negatively impact the spiritual and medicinal 
 purity of resident flora on the Peaks. Several specific concerns have been raised 
 about the impact of snowmaking on the spiritual values of the Peaks. 
</p>
<p> An additional concern is that some of the reclaimed water once passed through 
 hospitals or mortuaries could carry the spirits of the dead with it. Those spirits, as 
 part of the water draining from the Peaks, would then infiltrate plants, thus affecting 
 their ritual purity. 
</p>
<p> From both a Hopi and Navajo perspective, any plants that would come into contact 
 with reclaimed water would be contaminated for medicinal purposes, as well as for 
 use in ceremonies needed to perpetuate their cultural values&#8230;. 
</p>
<p> The Hopi believe that the <i>Katsinam </i>are responsible for moisture and that the 
 installation of snowmaking technology within the SUP [special use permit] area 
 would alter the natural processes of the San Francisco Peaks and the responsibilities 
 of the <i>Katsinam</i>. 
</p>
<p> The Hopi, Navajo, and other tribes have existed in the region of the San Francisco 
 Peaks for thousands of years and have developed their cultures and religious 
 institutions around the natural and cultural landscape of the San Francisco Peaks. 
 Traditions, responsibilities, and beliefs that delineate who they are as a people, and 
 as a culture, are based on conducting ritual ceremonies they are obligated to perform 
 as keepers of the land. These obligatory activities focus on the Peaks, which are a 
 physical and spiritual microcosm of their cultures, beliefs, and values. Snowmaking 
 and expansion of facilities, especially the use of reclaimed water, would contaminate 
 the natural resources needed to perform the required ceremonies that have been, and 
 continue to be, the basis for the cultural identity for many of these tribes.2
</p>
<p>7. The records of the proceedings in federal court litigation concerning Snowbowl&#8217;s ski 
operations on the San Francisco Peaks reinforce the above assessment of the sacred 
character of the Peaks, and of the effects on Native American religion of the planned 
snowmaking and other modifications, on top of the effects of the existing ski facilities.3 
Even while holding that the Government&#8217;s approval of the Snowbowl modifications did not 
violate federal law, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, acknowledged the 
sacred character of the San Francisco Peaks and that &#8220;[t]o the [tribes], the [presence of 
recycled wastewater] will desecrate a sacred mountain and will decrease the spiritual 
fulfillment they get from practicing their religion on the mountain&#8221;.4

<p>Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). For the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, RFRA only 
protects against government action that actively coerces Native American religious 
practitioners into violating their religious beliefs or that penalizes their religious activity 
with loss or threat loss of government benefits. Along with finding the absence of such 
conditions, the court pointed to the lower court determination that in fact no plants or 
religious shrines would be physically affected by the snowmaking and that practitioners 
would continue to have access to the mountain, including the ski area, to conduct religious 
activities.5 Neither the appellate nor lower court questioned, however, that for Native 
American religious practitioners from several tribes, snowmaking with recycled wastewater 
in Snowbowl would be a desecration of a sacred mountain, even if federal and state 
environmental standards are met and they continue to have access to the mountain along 
with skiers. 
</p>
<p>9. It is not the purpose of the Special Rapporteur to review or challenge the application 
of domestic law by the United States judicial system. Rather, the Special Rapporteur means 
to draw attention to the relevant international standards that bind the United States and that 
should guide action by Government actors, even when certain decisions may be permissible 
under domestic law. The Special Rapporteur respectfully reminds the United States that the 
judicial applications and interpretations of the legal protections for Native American 
religion available under domestic law do not pose any legal barrier to Government action in 
accordance with a higher standard.

<p><i>  The lack of indigenous agreement or consent to artificial snowmaking on a sacred 
mountain 
</i></p>
<p>10. In its Record of Decision to permit snowmaking from recycled wastewater and other 
modifications to the ski operation on the San Francisco Peaks, the United States Forest 
Service acknowledged that &#8220;[o]ver the years the tribes have continued to state their 
opposition to development at Snowbowl&#8221;, as they did in 1979 when the Forest Service was 
considering the option of closing down the ski operation but decided instead to allow it to 
expand.6  The Forest Service reported extensive consultations with the tribes about the most 
recent plans for Snowbowl enhancements. &#8220;In all 200 phone calls were made, 41 meetings 
were held, and 245 letters were sent to Tribal officials, tribal historic preservation offices, 
traditional tribal leaders/practitioners, and the general tribal public&#8221;.7  
</p>
<p>11. The Forest Service confirms that &#8220;[a]s with the decision in 1979, the proposal to 
improve the facilities at the Snowbowl has been met with adamant opposition from the 
tribes, even though there have been changes in laws, improvements in working 
relationships and successes in working together on other projects &#8230;&#8221;.8 Despite this 
adamant opposition by the tribes based on their religious practices and beliefs, the Forest 
Service decided to approve the artificial snowmaking and other ski area modifications, 
bringing into question the United States&#8217; adherence to international standards to which it 
has expressed its commitment.

<p> prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing any legislative 
 measure that affects them. 
</p>
<p>12. This standard of consultation and consent is a corollary of the right to self-
determination and the cultural rights of minorities that are affirmed, respectively, in articles 
1 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as manifested by the 
jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee.9 Additionally, it is instrumental to 
implementing the principles of non-discrimination found in the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as instructed by the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).10 In its General Recommendation 23, 
CERD calls upon State parties to &#8220;[e]nsure that members of indigenous peoples have equal 
rights in respect of effective participation in public life and that no decisions directly 
relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent ...&#8221;.11
</p>
<p>13. Under the cited human rights treaties, to which the United States is a party, and the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which the United States has endorsed, 
consultations should take place with the objective of achieving agreement or consent by 
indigenous peoples to decisions that may directly affect them in significant ways, such as 
decisions affecting their sacred sites. Simply providing indigenous peoples with 
information about a proposed decision and gathering and taking into account their points of 
view is not sufficient in this context. Consultation must occur through procedures of 
dialogue aimed at arriving at a consensus.12
</p>
<p>14. It is far from clear that the consultations with the tribes about the artificial 
snowmaking and other ski area modifications were undertaken through procedures 
involving negotiations toward an agreed-upon outcome. It appears instead that the 
consultations were more in the nature of dissemination of information about the Snowbowl 
development plans and gathering of views about those plans, within a process of 
government decision making that did not depend on agreement or consent on the part of the 
tribes.13 In any case, it is beyond question that the tribes have not agreed or consented to the 
Snowbowl modifications; indeed they have actively opposed them.  
</p>
<p>15. In the absence of consent by indigenous peoples to decisions that affect them, States 
should act with great caution. At a minimum, States should ensure that any such decision 
does not infringe indigenous peoples&#8217; internationally-protected collective or individual 
rights, including the right to maintain and practice religion in relation to sacred sites. It is

<p>proposed ski area modifications, as a result of the nomination of the San Francisco Peaks for 
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, and it invited the tribes to sign the MOA as 
concurring parties. The Forest Service reported that four of the affected tribes did sign, while the 
others (including Navajo and Hopi) declined to do so or did not respond. FEIS-Record of Decision, 
pp. 26-27. The MOA does not embody or propose agreement to the ski area modifications but rather 
provides for a series of measures calculated to mitigate adverse effects of the development of the ski 
area and to protect the cultural values associated with the San Francisco Peaks. See FEIS, Appendix 
D. While most of the affected tribes did not sign the MOA, it is not clear that any of them were 
involved in developing its terms, other than indirectly through the consultations reported by the Forest 
Service.

<p>therefore necessary in this case to assess the nature of the right of Native Americans to 
practice their religious traditions under international human rights standards and the scope 
of permissible restriction of the right. 
</p>
<p><i>  International standards protecting the right of Native Americans to maintain and practice 
their religious traditions 
</i></p>
<p>16. Under relevant sources of international law, the United States has a duty to respect 
and protect Native American religion, a duty that goes beyond not coercing or penalizing 
Native American religious practitioners. The right of indigenous peoples to maintain and 
practice their distinctive religions, including in relation to sacred areas, is protected by the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Further, it is recognized specifically 
by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which provides an 
authoritative statement of standards that States should follow in keeping with their 
obligations under these and other human rights treaties, as well as under the human rights 
clauses of the United Nations Charter. Any restriction on the right of indigenous peoples to 
maintain and practice their religious traditions, not just those involving active coercion or 
penalties, is subject to the most exacting scrutiny under these international instruments.  
</p>
<p>17. The right to practice or manifest religion or belief is protected under Article 18(1) of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that &#8220;[e]veryone shall 
have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion [which includes] freedom &#8230; 
either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his 
religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.&#8221; State parties have a duty 
to take the measures necessary to ensure the effective enjoyment of this and other rights 
recognized the Covenant (Art. 2(2)). In its Article 27, which is also of relevance to 
indigenous peoples, the Covenant gives special consideration to the rights of minorities 
whose cultural and religious traditions differ from those of the majority. Article 27 states, 
&#8220;Persons belonging to minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other 
members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own 
religion &#8230;&#8221;. In its interpretation of State parties&#8217; obligations under Article 27, the Human 
Rights Committee, in its General Comment 23 affirmed that &#8220;positive measures by States 
may also be necessary to protect the identity of a minority and the rights of its members to 
enjoy and develop their culture and language and to practise their religion, in community 
with other members of the group&#8221;.14  
</p>
<p>18. Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination provides that State parties are to &#8220;guarantee the right of everyone &#8230; to 
equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of &#8230;[t]he right to freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion.&#8221; In interpreting and applying this Convention, CERD has observed 
the need to take into account the particular characteristics of groups in order to achieving 
effective equality in the enjoyment of their human rights. Otherwise, &#8220;[t]o treat in an equal 
manner persons or groups whose situations are objectively different will constitute 
discrimination in effect, as will the unequal treatment of persons whose situations are 
objectively the same.&#8221;15 Accordingly, in its General Recommendation 23, CERD has noted 
the distinctive characteristics of indigenous peoples in light of their histories and cultures, 
and has called upon States to take particular measures to protect their rights, including 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>measures to &#8220;[e]nsure that indigenous communities can exercise their rights to practise and 
revitalize their cultural traditions and customs &#8230;&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>19. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which reinforces the call to 
ensure for indigenous peoples the enjoyment of fundamental human rights historically 
denied to them, for its part affirms that &#8220;[i]ndigenous peoples have the right to manifest, 
practice, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; 
the rights to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural 
sites&#8221; (Art. 12). Additionally, Article 25 of the Declaration provides that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; right to &#8220;maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their 
traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, territories &#8230; and to uphold their 
responsibilities to future generations in this regard.&#8221; The Declaration thus recognizes that, 
for indigenous peoples, the ability to effectively practice and manifest their religion and 
beliefs depends many times on the protection of and access to sites of particular religious 
and cultural significance. Consequently, the duty of States to ensure on an equal basis the 
right to the free exercise of religion includes that duty to adopt safeguards for the exercise 
of indigenous religious traditions in connection with sacred sites.  
</p>
<p><i>  Permissible limitations on the right to maintain and practice religion 
</i></p>
<p>20. The international law duty of States to ensure the exercise by indigenous peoples of 
their religious traditions extends to safeguarding against any meaningful limitations to that 
exercise, not just limitations that entail coercion to act against one&#8217;s religious beliefs or 
penalties for doing so. Under Article 18(3) of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
&#8220;Freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as 
prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of others.&#8221; With this standard there is no qualification on 
the kind of limitation or restriction that must undergo examination for justification on the 
basis of the stated purposes. Under the plain language of Article 18 of the Covenant, <i>any</i> 
clearly observable limitation that makes for a meaningful restriction on the exercise of 
religion is subject to scrutiny.  
</p>
<p>21. The process of snowmaking from reclaimed sewage water on the San Francisco 
Peaks undoubtedly constitutes a palpable limitation on religious freedom and belief, as 
clearly indicated by the U.S. Forest Service&#8217;s Final Environmental Impact Statement. This 
limitation exists even assuming minimal physical environmental degradation as a result of 
the snowmaking. It bears remembering that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
acknowledged that the effect of the proposed use of reclaimed wastewater would constitute 
a desecration of the affected indigenous peoples&#8217; religion.17 The religious freedom at stake 
is not simply about maintaining ceremonial or medicinal plants free from adverse physical 
environmental conditions or about physical access to shrines within the Peaks. More 
comprehensively, it is about the integrity of entire religious belief systems and the critical 
place of the Peaks and its myriad qualities within those belief systems.    
</p>
<p><i>  Is the limitation on Native American religion necessary to achieve a valid public purpose 
or protect the human rights of others? 
</i></p>
<p>22. It may be concluded without much difficulty that the limitation on Native American 
religion resulting from the decision of the U.S. Forest Service to permit the artificial 
snowmaking is &#8220;prescribed by law&#8221;, in the sense that it is pursuant to the Forest Service&#8217;s 
authority and legally prescribed procedures for managing the lands around the San

<p>Francisco Peaks. The question remains, however, whether the limitation from that decision 
is &#8220;necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others&#8221;, as stipulated by Article 18(3) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. This question in turn entails two inquires: first, whether an adequate 
purpose is being pursued and, second, whether the limitation on Native American religion 
is necessary to achieve that purpose. 
</p>
<p>23. As to the first question, whether there is a sufficient purpose within the terms of 
article 18(3) of the Covenant, the Human Rights Committee in its General 
Recommendation 22 has explained that this provision &#8220;is to be strictly interpreted: 
restrictions are not allowed on grounds not specified there... Limitations may be applied 
only for those purposes for which they were prescribed&#8221;.18 It is far from apparent how the 
decision to permit snowmaking by a private recreational ski facility is in furtherance of one 
of the specified public purposes &#8211; public safety, order, health or morals &#8211; or the human 
rights of others. In its Record of Decision on the artificial snowmaking and other 
modifications to the ski area, the Forest Service explained that &#8220;[d]ownhill skiing is an 
important component of the recreation opportunities offered by National Forests, and the 
Forest Service and the ski industry have forged a partnership to provide recreational 
opportunities on [National Forest Service] lands.&#8221;19 In the view of the Forest Service, &#8220;the 
overall benefits of providing stable winter recreational opportunities for the public and the 
community&#8230; merits [the] selection&#8221; of the proposed use of recycled wastewater for 
snowmaking operations.20 In this connection, the Forest Service considered the financial 
viability of Snowbowl to be a factor: &#8220;Snowbowl&#8217;s ability to maintain or improve its 
current level of service and endure the business conditions caused by unreliable snowfall is 
questionable&#8230;  [Therefore] the installation and operation of snowmaking infrastructure&#8230; 
will enable a reliable and consistent operating season, thereby helping to stabilize the 
Snowbowl&#8217;s viability&#8221;. 21
</p>
<p>24. Even assuming that a sufficient purpose could be discerned, it is left to be 
determined whether the limitation on religion arising from the artificial snowmaking is 
necessary for that purpose, necessity being in significant part a function of proportionality. 
As stated by the Human Rights Committee, &#8220;[l]imitations &#8230; must be directly related and 
proportionate to the specific need on which they are predicated&#8221;.22 An assessment of 
necessity and proportionality requires examination of the nature and severity of the 
limitation on religion, in relation to the identified valid purpose and the manner in which 
the purpose is being pursued. In this respect as well, it is far from readily apparent how the 
limitation on Native American religion imposed by the planned snowmaking can be 
justified.   
</p>
<p>25. In determining necessity and proportionality, there must be due regard for the 
significance of the San Francisco Peaks in the religious traditions of the tribes, the 
desecration that the artificial snowmaking signifies, and the cumulative effect of that 
desecration. The artificial snowmaking simply builds on what already was an affront to 
religious sensibilities: the installation of the ski area in the first place and its gradual 
expansion. In its Final Environmental Impact Statement, the Forest Service noted the past, 
present and potential future cumulative effects of the ski operation, with its expansion and 
upgrades, on the cultural resources in the area.23 The cumulative effects on Native

<p>American religion of the expansions and upgrades of the ski operation, and not just the 
added effects of the snowmaking, must be found necessary and proportionate in relation to 
some sufficient purpose. It is highly questionable that the effects on Native American 
religion can be justified under a reasonable assessment of necessity and proportionality, if 
the purpose behind the Government decision to permit the enhancements to the ski 
operation is none other than to promote recreation.   </p>
<p><i>  Recommendations  
</i></p>
<p>26. On the basis of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur respectfully recommends that 
the United States Government engage in a comprehensive review of its relevant policies 
and actions to ensure that they are in compliance with international standards in relation to 
the San Francisco Peaks and other Native American sacred sites, and that it take appropriate 
remedial action. 
</p>
<p>27. In this connection, the Government should reinitiate or continue consultations with 
the tribes whose religions practices are affected by the ski operations on the San Francisco 
Peaks and endeavor to reach agreement with them on the development of the ski area. The 
Government should give serious consideration to suspending the permit for the 
modifications of Snowbowl until such agreement can be achieved or until, in the absence of 
such an agreement, a written determination is made by a competent government authority 
that the final decision about the ski area modifications is in accordance with the United 
States&#8217; international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress the need to ensure that actions or decisions 
by Government agencies are in accordance with, not just domestic law, but also 
international standards that protect the right of Native American to practice and maintain 
their religious traditions. The Special Rapporteur is aware of existing government programs 
and policies to consult with indigenous peoples and take account their religious traditions in 
government decision-making with respect to sacred sites. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to build on these programs and policies to conform to international standards 
and by doing so to establish a good practice and become a world leader that it can in 
protecting the rights of indigenous peoples.
