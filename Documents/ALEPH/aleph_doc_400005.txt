MESSAGE TO UNITHOLDERS
The second quarter is traditionally the slowest quarter for the oil and gas industry as spring break-up, shut-downs of
wells  and  facilities  for  maintenance  activities  and  typically wet  weather  result  in  fewer  well  completions  and  lower
production.  Record  rainfall  in  the  early  part  of  the  second  quarter  immobilized  equipment  and  shut  down  roads  to
facilities and unusually hot weather in June 2007 impacted plant compressors. In the latter part of the second quarter of 
2007, foreign exchange rates impacted oil and gas producers as the Canadian dollar rose against its U.S. counterpart 
and much of the benefit from increasing oil prices was eroded by the increase in the Canadian dollar. Natural gas prices
began to decline during the latter part of the second quarter as large injections into storage were made. In spite of these
challenges, ARC Energy Trust’s (“ARC” or the “Trust”) quarterly performance met expectations and was typical for a 
second  quarter.  ARC  benefited  from  its  balanced  mix  of  oil  and  natural  gas  assets  as  the  price  increase  in one
commodity offset the decrease in the other.
ARC’s production averaged 61,637 boe per day during the second quarter of 2007 almost the same as the 61,803 boe
per  day  for  the  same  period  in  2006.  On  a  production  basis,  the  second  quarter  is  typically  ARC’s  lowest  as
maintenance  activities  are  carried-out  on both  ARC’s  operated  and  non-operated  facilities,  which  result  in  some
production being shut-in during the maintenance period. Approximately  2,000 boe per day of production  was shut-in
during the second quarter of 2007 due to maintenance. Almost half of this shut-in production was due to unscheduled
maintenance  activities  or  turnarounds  taking  longer  than  expected.  Unusually hot  weather  across  the  prairies  in  the 
latter part of the second quarter contributed to unexpected shut-downs as compressors over-heated due to the rising
temperatures.  Production  restrictions  in  ARC’s  northern  Alberta  area  were  in  place  for  the  past  six  months  as  ARC 
awaits the construction of a new gas plant to handle production volumes in the Dawson and Pouce South areas. ARC
anticipates completion of the third-party gas plant by the fourth quarter of 2007 with an anticipated start-up date for the 
plant to begin gathering production in November 2007.
Volumes are returning back to normal as facilities are reactivated and ARC expects production to be back at regular 
rates for the third quarter of 2007. We continue to forecast full year average production of 63,000 boe per day. Although 
maintenance activities take precedence during the second quarter, ARC continued to execute its capital program. ARC 
drilled  eight  wells  during  the  quarter,  including  the  third  well  of  a  four-well  horizontal  drilling  program  in  the  Dawson
area.  These  wells  will  be  completed  during  the  third  quarter  with  production  expected  to  be  on-stream  in  the  fourth
quarter of 2007 once additional processing capacity is available.
ARC spent $48.5 million on its capital program during the second quarter of 2007 and funded 82 per cent of the capital 
program for the quarter through cash flow with the balance funded through the distribution reinvestment plan (“DRIP”). 
Year-to-date expenditures on the capital program currently stand at $126 million. Costs for certain services began to
decline as many companies have reduced their natural gas drilling programs and many rigs are standing idle. ARC is
constantly  reviewing  its  contracts  and  re-bidding  when possible  to  realize  a  savings  in  service  costs.  ARC’s  initial 
capital guidance of $360 million reflected an assumed capital savings of five percent relative to costs incurred in 2006; 
as  a  result  of  additional  savings  being  realized,  ARC  is lowering its  guidance  for  2007  capital  expenditures  to  $350
million while maintaining our volume guidance. A significant ramp-up in capital spending is expected during the third 
and  fourth  quarters  of  2007  as  ARC  executes  its  drilling  activities  in  all  of  its  focus  areas.  Although  gas  prices  are
2
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 3
expected  to  stay  low,  ARC will  carry  out  its  shallow gas  drilling  program as  budgeted.  ARC  expects  to  drill 
approximately 275 wells in total in 2007.
Commodity  prices  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007  were  effectively  the  same  as  the  prior  year  with ARC’s  average 
realized price before hedging being $54.37 per boe compared to $54.42 per boe in the second quarter of 2006. The 
average WTI oil price of US$65.21 was nine per cent lower in the second quarter of 2007 than the US$71.86 WTI price
in  2006,  however,  the  price  of  oil  started  moving  higher  in  the  latter  part  of  the  quarter  with  WTI  price  averaging
US$67.53 in June 2007 and increased to greater than $75 per barrel by mid July. The gain in oil prices toward the end
of the quarter was partially offset by a strong increase in the Canadian dollar as the U.S. dollar decreased by eight per
cent in the second quarter of 2007 and continued to decrease into the third quarter. A lower U.S. dollar translates into a
lower Canadian price for oil and gas thereby reducing revenue. A 16 per cent increase in ARC’s realized natural gas 
price  of  $7.38  per  mcf  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007  compared  to  $6.35  per  mcf  in  the  comparable  period  in  2006
helped to offset the lower average oil price. The AECO monthly price averaged $7.37 per mcf for the quarter compared
to $6.28 for the second quarter of 2006. Natural gas prices started on a downward trend in June and have decreased
significantly since then. ARC’s strategy of maintaining a  balanced mix between oil and natural gas  helps to mitigate
price fluctuations in one commodity versus the other.
Though natural gas prices are expected to stay low and the exchange rate does impact revenue, ARC’s distribution will 
be maintained at $0.20 per unit for the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis distributions have been 71 per cent of
Cash Flow, well within the parameters that the Trust is comfortable with.
On the health and safety front, we are pleased to report that there were no lost time incidents for either our employees
or contractors during the quarter as well as on a year-to-date basis.
In  June  2007,  the  Federal  Government  passed  Bill  C-52,  the  Budget  Implementation  Act,  containing  the  legislation 
pertaining  to  the  taxation  of  income  trusts.  ARC  continues  to  assess  the  impact  of  this  legislation  and  is  reviewing 
alternatives  in respect  to  its  future  structure  once  the  tax  becomes  effective  on  January  1,  2011.  Regardless  of  the 
corporate  structure  we are  in,  we  are  focused  on  creating  long-term  value  for  our  investors  through  the  disciplined
development of our exceptional asset base.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS / FINANCIAL UPDATE

Production averaged 61,637 boe per day in the second quarter of 2007, relatively unchanged from 61,803 boe
per day achieved in the second quarter of 2006. The second quarter is normally the low point for the year as
maintenance activities at both ARC operated and third party operated facilities result in production being shut-
in.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2007  approximately 2,000  boe  per  day  of  production was  shut-in  due  to
maintenance activities and other operational disruptions. Production in the third quarter is expected to return to
normal levels. The Trust has maintained its full year production guidance of 63,000 boe per day.
The Trust drilled eight wells during the quarter including the third well of a four-well horizontal drilling program
at  Dawson  in  northeast  British  Columbia,  keeping  the  Trust  on  track  to  reach  natural  gas  production  of  40
mmcf/d for this property by the fourth quarter. Achieving this goal is dependent upon the completion of a third
party gas plant that is currently under construction with an anticipated start-up date of November 1, 2007.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48.5 million, 86 per cent of which was funded from Cash Flow with
the remainder funded with proceeds from the distribution reinvestment program (DRIP).  Year-to-date capital
expenditures are $126 million, all which have been funded from Cash Flow and the proceeds from the DRIP. 
The Trust expects to spend approximately $350 million on capital expenditures during 2007.
Prior to hedging activities, ARC’s total realized commodity price was $54.48 per boe in the second quarter of 
2007, relatively unchanged from the $54.54 per boe received prior to hedging in the second quarter of 2006. 
The Trust  benefited  from  a  balanced  production  mix,  whereby  a  16  per cent  increase  in  natural  gas  prices
offset a nine per cent decrease in oil prices in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of
2006.
In addition to the fluctuations in the commodity price, the Canadian dollar appreciated significantly against the 
U.S.  dollar,  reaching  a  30  year  high  of  CDN/USD  $0.94 at  the  end  of  the  second  quarter.  The  average
CDN/USD for the second quarter of 2007 was $0.91, a seven per cent increase from CDN/USD$0.85 in the
first quarter of 2007. The Trust has seen a negative impact to revenue, and therefore Cash Flow, during the
quarter  because  commodity prices  are  derived  from  U.S.  dollar  posted  prices  for  both  oil  and  natural  gas.
Future revenues may be negatively impacted due to the  continued strengthening of the Canadian dollar. In 
July 2007, the dollar has continued to appreciate with the latest record high being USD/CDN $0.96 on July 16,
2007. Conversely, the Trust has benefited from management’s decision to hold a major portion of the Trust’s 
subsidiaries’ debt in U.S. dollars. The Trust has seen a significant decrease in the Canadian dollar equivalent 
of its debt balance; however, the majority of this gain is a non-cash, unrealized gain.
Net income for the quarter was $184.9 million, effectively unchanged from $182.5 million in the second quarter 
of 2006. The Trust has recorded a $35.6 million one time increase in earnings and a corresponding decrease
to its future income tax liability as a result of the passage of the previously announced tax on income trusts.

Cash  Flow  for  the  quarter was  $167.6  million  of  which  $124.1  million was  distributed  to  unitholders
representing  $0.60  per  unit  based  on  the  number  of  trust  units  outstanding  at  each  record  date.  The  Trust 
announced third quarter distributions will remain at $0.20 per unit per month, a level that has been maintained
since October 2005.
The  Trust  recorded  the  sale  of  its  long-term  investment  during  the  second  quarter.  A  gain  of  $13.3  million 
dollars was recorded and the full proceeds of $33.3 million were recorded in cash flow from investing activities
during the quarter. The net debt balance excluding unrealized risk management contract assets and liabilities
of $653.9 million at June 30, 2007 incorporates the proceeds from the sale.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is dated July 31, 2007 and should be read in conjunction with 
the June 30, 2007 unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of ARC Energy Trust (“ARC”, “the Trust”, “we”, 
“our”), the March 31, 2007 unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and MD&A, as well as the audited 
consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Non-GAAP Measures 
Management uses Cash Flow and Cash Flow per unit derived from cash flow from operating activities (before changes
in non-cash  working capital  and  expenditures on site reclamation and restoration) to  analyze  operating  performance
and  leverage.  Cash  Flow as  presented  does  not  have  any  standardized  meaning  prescribed  by Canadian  generally
accepted  accounting  principles,  (“GAAP”)  and therefore  it  may  not  be comparable with  the  calculation  of  similar 
measures  for  other  entities.  Cash  Flow  as  presented  is  not  intended  to  represent  operating  cash  flow  or  operating 
profits for the period nor should it be viewed as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, net earnings or
other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with Canadian GAAP.  Management uses the non-
GAAP measure of Cash Flow because we feel that it is a more meaningful measure of the true cash generated in a
period  from  active  operations  and  therefore  have  concluded  that  it is  material  and  relevant  to  discuss  Cash  Flow
throughout this MD&A.
The  following  table  reconciles  the  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  to  Cash  Flow,  which  is  used  frequently  in  this
MD&A:

Management uses certain key performance indicators (“KPIs”) and industry benchmarks such as distributions as a per
cent  of  Cash  Flow,  operating  netbacks  (“netbacks”),  total  capitalization,  finding,  development  and  acquisition  costs, 
recycle  ratio,  reserve  life  index,  reserves  per  unit  and  production  per  unit  to  analyze  financial  and  operating
performance.  Management  feels  that  these  KPIs  and  benchmarks  are  key  measures  of  profitability  and  overall 
sustainability  for  the  Trust.  These  KPIs  and  benchmarks  as  presented  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning
prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other
entities.

Update on Legislation Changes Impacting the Trust
Federal Government’s Trust Tax Legislation   
In April 2007, the Federal Government included the proposed Trust Taxation in the Federal Budget (“Bill C-52”).  Bill C-
52  received  a  third  reading  on  June  12,  2007  and  then  Royal  Assent  on  June  22,  2007,  thus  fully enacting  the  tax 
measures.  As  a  result  the  Trust  has  recorded  a  $35.6  million  one  time  increase  in  earnings  and  a  corresponding 
decrease to its future income tax liability as a result of timing differences within the Trust that have not been previously
recognized.  The  initial  recognition  of  $35.6  million  comprises  $24.7  million  for  pre-2007  generated  temporary 
differences and $10.9 million for temporary differences relating to the current year.
Our Board of Directors and Management continue to review the impact of this tax on our business strategy. We expect 
future technical interpretations and details will further clarify the legislation. At the present time, ARC believes that if 
structural or other similar changes are not made, the after-tax distribution amount in 2011 to taxable Canadian investors
will  remain  approximately  the  same,  however,  the  distribution  amount  in  2011  to  tax-deferred  Canadian investors
(RRSPs, RRIFs, pension plans, etc.) and foreign investors would fall by an estimated 31.5 percent and 26.5 percent, 
respectively.
Climate Change Programs   
On March 8, 2007, the Alberta government introduced legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity. Bill 3 
states  that  facilities  emitting  more  than  100,000  tonnes  of  greenhouse  gases  per  year  must  reduce  their  emissions
intensity by 12 per cent over the average emissions levels of 2003, 2004 and 2005; if they are not able to do so, these
facilities will be required to pay $15 per tonne for every tonne above the 12 per cent target, beginning on July 1, 2007.
At  this  time,  the  Trust  has  determined  that  the  impact  of  this  legislation  would  be  minimal  based  on  ARC’s  existing
facilities ownership.
In April 2007, the Federal Government announced a new climate change plan that calls for greenhouse gas emissions
to be reduced by 20 per cent below current levels by 2020. Firms may employ the following strategies to achieve the
targets. They will be able to:
• make in-house reductions;  
•
•
•
•
take advantage of domestic emissions trading; 
purchase offsets; 
use the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol; and,  
invest in a technology fund.
The Trust is waiting for additional information so as to fully assess what impact, if any, this new legislation will have on
our operations.

United States Proposed Changes to Qualifying Dividends   
A  bill  was  introduced  into  United  States  Congress  on  March  23,  2007  that  could  deny qualified  dividend  income
treatment  to  the  distributions  made  by  the  Trust  to  its  U.S.  unitholders. The  bill  is  in  the  first  step  of  the  legislative 
process and it is uncertain whether it  will eventually be passed into law in its current form. If the bill is passed in its 
current form, distributions received by U.S. unitholders would no longer qualify for the 15 per cent qualified dividend tax
rate.

Refer to Non-GAAP Measures.   
Based on number of trust units outstanding at each cash distribution date. 
Reported  production  amount  is  based  on  company  interest,  which  includes  royalty  interest  and  is  before  royalty burdens. 
Where applicable in this MD&A natural gas has been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) based on 6 mcf: 1 bbl. The
boe rate is based on an energy equivalent conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a 
value equivalent at the well head. Use of boe in isolation may be misleading.
Net Income 
Net income in the second quarter of 2007 was $184.9 million ($0.90 per unit), an increase of $2.4 million from $182.5
million ($0.91 per unit) in the second quarter of 2006. Higher operating costs ($7.9 million), interest costs ($1.7 million)
and  depletion  expense  ($4.6  million)  in  the  quarter were  almost  entirely  offset  by an  increased gain  on  foreign
exchange ($12.7 million). In addition, the Trust recorded an increased gain on risk management contracts ($14 million)
that was offset by a lower future income tax recovery ($24.5 million) and the recording of a gain on sale of investment 
($13.3 million).
Cash Flow
Cash Flow was $167.6 million in the second quarter of 2007 a 14 per cent decrease from $194.7 million recorded in the
second  quarter  of  2006.  The  decrease  in  second  quarter  Cash  Flow was  attributed  to  an  $11  million  decrease  in
realized  cash hedging  gains,  an  $8.5  million  increase  in cash  operating  costs  and  a  $5.7  million  increase  in  cash
general  and  administrative  (“G&A”)  costs.  The  increase  in operating  costs,  more  fully  described  later  in  this  MD&A,
were due primarily to turnaround and workovers that occurred in the quarter and the G&A cost increase is attributed to
the cash payout under the Trust’s Whole Unit Plan which occurred in the second quarter.

Production
Production volume averaged 61,637 boe per day in the second quarter of 2007, relatively unchanged from 61,803 boe 
per day during the second quarter of 2006. The Trust experienced significant production loss during the second quarter
as a result of planned turnarounds and workovers. Of the approximately 2,000 boe per day of volumes that were shut-in
during the quarter, the Trust estimates that 1,000 boe per day was lost due to either unscheduled activities or where
turnarounds  took  significantly  longer  than  expected.  The  Trust  expects  third  quarter  production  to  return  to  normal
levels.  We have maintained our full year 2007 production guidance at 63,000 boe per day.
Throughout the first six months of 2007, the Trust has experienced production restrictions in the northern Alberta area
as a result of gas plant capacity constraints. A new third party plant is scheduled to be on-line in the fourth quarter of
2007 to handle existing excess production as well as additional development production from both Dawson and Pouce
South. As of June 30, the Trust had three horizontal wells in Dawson that were waiting to be completed. It is anticipated
that  these  wells  will be  completed  during  the  third  quarter so  that  they can  be  brought  on  production  in  the  fourth
quarter when there is additional processing capacity for the resulting production.
The Trust’s objective is to maintain annual production through the drilling of wells and other development activities. In
fulfilling this objective, there may be fluctuations in production depending on the timing of new wells coming on-stream.

ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 10
During the second quarter of 2007, the Trust drilled eight gross wells (six net wells) on operated properties with a 100
per  cent  success  rate;  six  gross  oil  wells  and  two  gross  natural  gas  wells.  Normally,  the  second  quarter  is  the  least
active quarter for drilling as field operations are restricted during “spring break-up” and do not get back to normal levels
until late in the quarter when field conditions have improved.

The price of oil in U.S. dollars decreased by eight per cent in the second quarter of 2007 as compared to the second
quarter of 2006 while the price of oil in Canadian dollars decreased by 10 per cent. The strengthening of the Canadian
dollar  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  was  responsible  for  the  larger  decrease  of  the  price  of  oil  in  Canadian  dollar  terms.
ARC’s realized oil price in the second quarter of 2007 was $65.21 per barrel, a nine per cent decrease over the $71.86
per barrel received in the second quarter of 2006 as minor changes in differential offset a portion of the decrease due to
the change in foreign exchange.

Natural  gas  prices  recovered  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007  with  the  Alberta  AECO  Hub  monthly  posting  averaging
$7.37 per mcf as compared to $6.28 per mcf for the comparable period of 2006. The Trust’s realized price of $7.38 per
mcf  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007  was  16  per  cent  higher  than  the  $6.35  per  mcf  price  realized  by  the  Trust  in  the
second quarter of 2006. The Trust’s realized gas price is based on prices received at the various markets in which the
Trust sells its natural gas. ARC’s natural gas sales portfolio consists of gas sales priced at the AECO monthly index, the
AECO daily spot market, eastern and mid-west United States markets and a portion to aggregators.
Prior  to  hedging  activities,  ARC’s  total  realized  commodity  price  was  $54.48  per  boe  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007,
relatively unchanged from the $54.54 per boe received prior to hedging in the second quarter of 2006. Given the Trust’s
balanced production mix, the increases in natural gas prices offset the decreases in oil prices during the period.

Risk Management and Hedging Activities
The Trust continues to maintain a strong hedging position with an emphasis on protecting Cash Flow and distributions
to unitholders.
During the second quarter ARC realized cash hedging gains of $0.3 million bringing cash hedging gains for the year-to-
date to $7.3 million. Gains on crude oil puts and foreign exchange positions were offset by settlements on natural gas
basis swaps and premiums paid for natural gas contracts.
In addition to layering into additional natural gas and crude oil positions during the quarter, ARC also modified positions 
that were previously on the books as part of its active hedging program.
ARC optimized its crude oil positions by restructuring the long-term 5,000 barrels per day hedge that was entered into
to protect the acquisition metrics of the 2005 Redwater / NPCU properties. ARC increased the floor price on the 3-way 
collar from $55.00 to an average of $61.26. This was achieved at no cost by lowering the ceiling price on the original
structure from $90.00 to $85.00 and raising the sold floor price from $40.00 to $50.00. This raises the average floor
price for crude oil hedges for 2008 to $63.33 per barrel.
On a forward-looking basis ARC continues to add layers of protection for both crude oil and natural gas production.
During  the  quarter  ARC  layered  on  additional  protection  on  crude  to  the  end  of  2008  and  additional  natural  gas
positions through to Q1 2008.
On crude oil production ARC has protected approximately 40 per cent of forecast oil production through year-end 2007, 
30 per cent of production through the first half of 2008, and 20 per cent of production for the second half of 2008. For
natural gas production ARC has protected approximately 32.5 per cent of production during the third quarter of 2007, 
20 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2007, and 15 per cent for the first quarter of 2008.

(1)  The prices and volumes noted above represent averages for several contracts and the average price for the portfolio of options
listed above does not have the same payoff profile as the individual option contracts. Viewing the average price of a group of 
options is purely for indicative purposes. The natural gas price shown translates all NYMEX positions to an AECO equivalent 
price. In addition to positions shown here, ARC has entered into additional basis positions.
(2)  Please refer to note 9 in the Trust’s unaudited consolidated financial statements as at June 30, 2007 and 2006 for a detailed
breakdown of the Trust’s hedging position as at June 30, 2007.
The  above  table  should  be  interpreted  as  follows  using the  third  quarter  2007  crude  oil  hedges  as  an  example.  The
Trust has hedged 13,000 barrels per day at a minimum average price of US$61.92 and participates in prices up to a
maximum average of US$86.48 on 8,500 barrels per day with no limit on the remaining 4,500 hedged barrels per day
and on all other unhedged production for the period. Finally, ARC’s average protected price of $61.92 reduces penny
for penny at an average price below $48.90 on 12,500 barrels per day.
As  a  result  of  commodity  hedging  contracts  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars,  ARC  systematically  enters  into  foreign
exchange  agreements  to  offset  this  exposure.  In  addition,  ARC  manages  these  foreign  exchange  positions  by
converting the forwards to U.S. dollar put spreads whereby ARC achieves a position that is a net asset.
Please  refer  to  "NON-GAAP  MEASURES"  that  occurs  as  the  first  heading  in  this  MD&A  for  a  reconciliation  of  Cash
Flow to cash flow from operating activities as prescribed by GAAP.
Gain or Loss on Risk Management Contracts
Gain  or  loss  on  risk  management  contracts  comprise  realized  and  unrealized  gains  or  losses  on  risk  management
contracts  that  do  not  meet  the  accounting  definition  requirements  of  an  effective  hedge,  even  though  the  Trust
considers  all  risk  management  contracts  to  be  effective  economic  hedges.  Accordingly,  gains  and  losses  on  such
contracts are shown as a separate category in the statement of income.
The Trust recorded a realized cash gain on risk management contracts of $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2007
compared to a gain of $11.3 million recorded in for the same period of 2006. The Trust had a similar hedging strategy in
place for the first quarters of 2007 and 2006; however, 2007 market prices were comparable to the Trust’s floor prices
13
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 14
for  natural  gas  resulting  in  cash  hedging  losses  being  the  premiums  paid  in  the  period.  The  $2.2  million  cash  loss 
recorded for natural gas was offset by small gains on the Trust’s crude oil and foreign exchange contracts.
The unrealized gain of $10.8 million was due mostly to a weakening of forward natural gas prices that have resulted in
unrealized gains in natural gas financial positions through the first quarter of 2008 and strengthening of the Canadian
dollar that has resulted in an increase in unrealized gains on foreign exchange positions partly offset by strengthening 
crude oil prices that have reduced the value of crude oil hedge positions.

Realized cash gains and losses represent actual cash settlements or receipts under the respective contracts. 
The unrealized (loss) gain on contracts represents the change in fair value of the contracts during the period.
Operating Netbacks 
The  Trust’s  operating  netback,  after  realized  hedging  gains,  decreased  by eight  per  cent  to  $34.75  per  boe  in  the
second quarter of 2007 compared to $37.90 per boe in the same period of 2006. The decrease in netbacks in 2007 is 
primarily due to higher operating costs and lower realized hedging gains. These amounts were partially offset by lower 
royalty costs.

(1) Operating expenses are composed of direct costs incurred to operate oil and gas wells. A number of assumptions have been
made in allocating these costs between oil, heavy oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production.
Royalties decreased to $9.43 per boe in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $9.78 per boe in the same period of 
2006. Royalties as a percentage of pre-hedged commodity revenue net of transportation costs decreased to 17.5 per
cent  compared  to  18  per  cent  in  the  second  quarter  of  2006.  The  decrease  in  royalty  rates  is  consistent  with  the 
changes in the Trust’s production profile as new production brought on-stream impacts the overall royalty rates.
Transportation costs increased nine per cent to $0.72 per boe in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $0.66 per boe
in the second quarter of 2006. The Trust has experienced challenges in Saskatchewan throughout the second half of 
2006 and the first half of 2007 due to shipping restrictions on the Enbridge pipeline as it is operating at full capacity.
During  the  first  quarter,  the  Trust  had  to  truck  approximately 900  boe  per  day  of  operated  oil  production  at  a  cost 
significantly greater than the cost to transport those volumes by pipeline. While transportation costs came down in the
second quarter of 2007 as compared to the first quarter of 2007, as a result of a reduction in trucked volumes, costs
were still higher than the second quarter of 2006. An expansion of the Enbridge pipeline is expected to be completed 
sometime in late 2007 or early 2008.
Operating costs increased to $9.63 per boe compared to $8.20 per boe in the second quarter of 2006. Total operating
costs in the second quarter of 2007 increased by $7.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2006. This increase is
due  to  increased  costs  for  workovers  and  maintenance  ($3  million),  increased  labour  and  LTIP  costs  ($0.9  million), 
increased lease rentals for renewals ($1.5 million), increased property taxes ($1 million), and 13th month adjustments 
booked in the quarter ($1.5 million).
In comparing the Trust’s total second quarter 2007 operating costs to the first quarter of 2007, operating costs have
increased  by $2  million.  This  amount  includes  higher  costs  for  workovers  and  maintenance  ($3  million)  net  of  a
reduction in processing fees recorded in the period ($1 million).

General and Administrative Expenses and Incentive Compensation
Cash  G&A  before  incentive  compensation and  net  of  overhead  recoveries  on  operated  properties  was  relatively
unchanged at $8.9 million in the second quarter of 2007 from $8.8 million in the same period of 2006. Increases in cash
G&A  expenses  for  2007 were  due  to  additional  staff  and higher  compensation  costs.  On  a  per  boe  basis,  second
quarter cash G&A costs increased two per cent to $1.59 per boe in 2007 from $1.56 per boe in 2006 as a result of
higher cash G&A costs and a slight decrease in production volumes.
During the second  quarter the Trust made a payment under the  Whole Unit Plan that included the first payment for 
performance units issued under the Plan in 2004. The cash payment made in April 2007 was $10.5 million of which
$8.3 million was recorded in G&A with the remainder $2.2 million being recorded to operating costs and capital projects.  
These amounts were fully accrued at the end of the first quarter of 2007; however, cash flow from operating activities in
the second quarter of 2007 has been decremented for the full amount of the cash payment.

A non-cash incentive compensation expense (“non-cash compensation expense”) of $(4.3) million was recorded in the
second quarter of 2007 which represents the estimated costs of the Whole Unit Plan for the period net of the accrual
reversal for the cash amount paid in April 2007.
Rights Plan
The  Rights  Plan  that  provides  employees,  officers  and  independent  directors  the  right  to  purchase  trust  units  at  a
specified price is being discontinued. All rights were fully vested and expensed as of March 31, 2007. At June 30, 2007, 
0.2 million rights were outstanding at an average exercise price of $8.95 per unit.

Whole Unit Incentive Plan (“Whole Unit Plan”) 
Please refer to our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2006 for a detailed description of the Whole Unit Plan that 
was  put  in  place  in  2004  as  a  replacement  to  the  Rights  Plan.  From  an  accounting  perspective,  the  full  cost  of  the
Whole Unit Plan is reflected in the cash G&A expenses while the cost of the Rights Plan was represented as a non-
cash charge against earnings.

(3) The performance multiplier only applies to PTUs and was estimated to be 1.6 at June 30, 2007 based on a weighted average
calculation of all outstanding grants. The performance multiplier is assessed at each period end based on management’s best
estimate of the performance multiplier at the time of vesting.
The value associated with the RTUs and PTUs is expensed in the statement of income over the vesting period with the
expense  amount  being  determined  by  the  trust  unit  price,  the  number  of  PTUs  to  be  issued  on  vesting,  and 
distributions. Therefore, the expense recorded in the statement of income fluctuates over time.

Includes an estimate of additional units to be issued for accrued distributions to vesting date. 
Values  will  fluctuate  over  the  vesting  period  based  on  the  volatility  of  the  underlying  trust  unit  price  and  distribution  levels.
Assumed future trust unit price of $21.74 per trust unit and distributions of $0.20 per trust unit per month based on current 
levels. 
Upon vesting, a cash payment is made equivalent to the value of the underlying trust units. The payment is made on vesting 
dates in April and October of each year and at that time is reflected as a reduction of cash flow from operating activities.
Due to the variability in the future payments under the plan, the Trust estimates that payments could range from $17.5
million  to  $59.6  million  from  2007  through  2010  based  on  the  current  trust  unit  price,  distribution  levels  and  a
performance multiplier ranging from zero to two.
Interest Expense 
Interest expense increased to $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2007 from $7.6 million in the second quarter of 2006
due to an increase in short-term interest rates, and higher debt balances. Interest expense for the first six months of
2007 was $19.2 million, an increase of $4 million from $15.2 million in the first six months of 2006.
The Trust’s debt balance as reflected in Canadian dollars has decreased significantly since December 31, 2006. This is
a result of the nine per cent appreciation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar. The Trust had US$420
million  in  outstanding  debt  at  December  31  of  which  US$380  million  was  still  outstanding  at  June  30,  2007.    The
Canadian  dollar  equivalent  of  the  US$380  million  debt  balance  has  decreased by $38.7  million  as  a  result  of  the
appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2006 to June 30, 2007.
Once  the  foreign  exchange  impact  is  taken  into  consideration,  the  Trust’s  debt  balance  has  remained  relatively
unchanged from year-end as a result of funding 100 per cent of the year to date capital program with Cash Flow and
18
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 19
As at June 30, 2007, the Trust had $644.8 million of debt outstanding, of which $238.3 million was fixed at a weighted
average rate of 5.06 per cent and $406.5 million was floating at current market rates plus a credit spread of 60 basis 
points. 63 per cent of the Trust’s debt is denominated in U.S. dollars.
Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses 
The Trust recorded a gain of $35.5 million on foreign exchange transactions compared to a gain of $22.8 million for the
second  quarter  of  2006.  These  amounts  include  both  realized  and  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses.
Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses are due to revaluation of U.S. denominated debt balances. The volatility
of  the  Canadian  dollar  during  the  reporting  period  has  a direct  impact  on  the  unrealized  component  of  the  foreign 
exchange gain or loss. During the second quarter of 2007, the Canadian dollar reached a 30 year high when compared
to the U.S. dollar. The dollar closed the quarter at $1.06 per U.S. dollar.
The  unrealized  gain/loss  impacts  net  income  but  does  not  impact  Cash Flow  as  it  is  a  non-cash  amount.  Realized
foreign  exchange  gains  or  losses  arise  from  U.S.  denominated  transactions  such  as  interest  payments,  debt 
repayments and hedging settlements.
Please refer to "NON-GAAP MEASURES" that occurs as the first heading in this MD&A for a reconciliation of Cash
Flow to cash flow from operating activities as prescribed by GAAP.
Taxes 
In the second quarter of 2007, a future income tax recovery of $46.4 million  was included in income compared to a
$70.9 million recovery in the second quarter of 2006. The second quarter 2006 recovery resulted from the future tax 
reductions recorded in the 2006 Federal budget that reduced the Trust’s expected future income tax rate to 29.7 per
cent from the  previous rate  of 33.7 per cent.  The corporate income tax rate  applicable to 2007  is 32.1 per cent as
compared to the expected future tax rate of 28.9 per cent.
ARC  does  not  anticipate  any  material  cash  income  taxes will be  paid  for  fiscal  2007.  Due  to  the  Trust’s  structure,
currently, both income tax and future tax liabilities are passed on to the unitholders by means of royalty and interest 
payments made by ARC Resources to the Trust.
The  Trust  is  currently assessing  various  alternatives with  respect  to  the  potential  implications  of  the  proposed  Trust
taxation,  therefore  the  Trust  has  not  arrived  at  a  final  conclusion  with  respect  to  future  organizational  structure  and
implications to the Trust. As a result of the enactment of bill C-52, the Trust has recorded a reduction in future income
taxes of $35.6 million related to ARC Energy Trust, as tax pools were in excess of the net book value of the assets. The 
initial  recognition  of  $35.6  million  comprises  $24.7  million  for  pre-2007  generated  temporary  differences  and  $10.9
million for temporary differences relating to the current year.
Capital taxes were eliminated effective January 1, 2006 pursuant to the Federal Government budget of May 2, 2006.

Depletion, Depreciation and Accretion of Asset Retirement Obligation
The  depletion,  depreciation  and  accretion  (“DD&A”)  rate  increased  to  $16.31  per  boe  in  the  second  quarter  of  2007
from $15.43 per boe in the second quarter of 2006.  Year-to-date, the DD&A rate has increased six percent to $16.33
per  boe  as  compared  to  $15.38  in  2006.  The  higher  DD&A  rate  is  driven  by  an  increase  in  the  property,  plant  and
equipment (“PP&E”) value on the Trust’s balance sheet along with an increase in the future development costs and a
slight decrease in proved reserves recorded in the Trust’s January 1, 2007 reserve report.

Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions
Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and dispositions, totaled $48.5 million in the second quarter of 2007
compared  to  $58.6  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  2006.  This  amount  was  incurred  on  drilling  and  completions,
geological, geophysical and  facilities  expenditures, and the purchase of undeveloped acreage.  The Trust also spent
$14.6 million on minor property acquisitions  in the second  quarter  of 2007 as compared to $5.2 million for the same
period in 2006.

Long-Term Investment 
During the second quarter, the Trust sold its investment in the shares of a private company that was involved in the
acquisition  of  oil  sands  leases.  The  transaction  closed on June  25,  2007.  The  Trust  recorded  a  cash  gain  of  $13.3
million with total proceeds of $33.3 million recorded as part of cash flow from investing activities.
Asset Retirement Obligation and Reclamation Fund 
At June 30, 2007, the Trust has recorded an Asset Retirement Obligation (“ARO”) of $168.8 million as compared to
$177.3  million  at  December  31,  2006  for  future  abandonment  and  reclamation  of  the  Trust’s  properties.  The  ARO 
balance has been reduced by $11.9 million for reclamation spending in the first half of 2007 ($7.2 million for the second
quarter of 2007). This amount has been offset by accretion of $5.8 million ($2.9 million for the second quarter of 2007).
In  addition,  a net  decrease  to  the  liability  of  $2.4  million  was  recorded  relating  to  a  change  in estimate  net  of 
development  activities  in  the  period.  The  Trust  did  not  record  a  gain  or  loss  on  actual  abandonment  expenditures
incurred as the costs closely approximated the liability value included in the ARO.
21
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 22
Reclamation spending in the second quarter of 2007 was 25 per cent funded by the reclamation fund. The remaining 75
per cent ($5.4 million) was funded temporarily through working capital. On a year-to-date basis, reclamation spending
has been 43 per cent funded through the reclamation fund and the remaining 57 per cent has been funded temporarily 
through working capital. On an annual basis, the Trust will adjust the balance of the reclamation fund for the full amount
of reclamation spending in the period.

The working capital deficit excludes the balances for risk management contracts.  
Total capitalization as presented does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore it may 
not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Total capitalization is not intended to represent 
the total funds from equity and debt received by the Trust. 
See “Non-GAAP Measures” section.
Net debt levels at June 30, 2007 have decreased since December 31, 2006 as a result of funding 100 per cent of the 
2007 year to date quarter capital program with Cash Flow and proceeds of the DRIP program. Lastly, the Trust’s net 
debt  balance has  decreased  significantly as  a  result  of  the  appreciation  in  the  Canadian  dollar  which  generated  an
unrealized  gain  of  $40.5  million  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2007.  As  at  June  30,  2007,  the  Trust  had  $380 
million in U.S. denominated debt.
The Trust has a syndicated three year revolving credit facility allowing for maximum borrowing of up to $800 million.
This was increased from $572 million at year-end 2006. The debt is secured by all the Trust’s oil and gas properties 
and is subject to the same major covenants as the prior credit facility described in the MD&A as at December 31, 2006.
In addition to the $800 million credit facility, the Trust has issued senior secured notes that do not reduce the available
borrowings under the credit facility. As at June 30, 2007, the Trust had $394.3 million of available borrowings under the
current credit facility.
The Trust intends to finance its $350 million 2007 capital program with Cash Flow and the proceeds of the distribution
reinvestment program with any remainder being financed with debt.

Unitholders’ Equity
At June 30, 2007, there were 210.2 million units issued and issuable for exchangeable shares, an increase from 207.2
million  units  from  December  31,  2006.  The  increase  in number  of  units  outstanding  is  mainly attributable  to  the  2.8 
million units issued pursuant to the DRIP during 2007 at an average price of $20.43 per unit.
The Trust had 0.2 million rights outstanding as of June 30, 2007 under an employee plan where further rights issuances
were discontinued in 2004. The remaining rights may be exercised at an average adjusted exercise price of $8.95 per 
unit as at June 30, 2007. All of the rights were fully vested at March 31, 2007. The contractual life of the rights varies by 
series but all will expire on or before March 22, 2009.
The Whole Unit Plan introduced in 2004 is a cash compensation plan for employees, officers and directors of the Trust 
and does not involve any trust units being issued from treasury. The Trust has made provisions whereby employees
may elect to have trust units purchased for them at prevailing prices on the market with the cash received upon vesting.
Unitholders electing to reinvest distributions or make optional cash payments to acquire trust units from treasury under
the DRIP may do so at a five per cent discount to the prevailing market price with no additional fees or commissions. 
During the second quarter of 2007, the Trust raised proceeds of $29.1 million and issued 1.4 million trust units pursuant 
to the DRIP.
Distributions
ARC declared distributions of $124.1 million ($0.60 per unit), representing 74 per cent of second quarter 2007 Cash
Flow compared to distributions of $120.6 million ($0.60 per unit), representing 62 per cent of Cash Flow in the second
quarter of 2006. The remaining 26 per cent of second quarter 2007 Cash Flow ($43.5 million) was used to fund 86 per 
cent  of  ARC’s  2007 year  to  date  capital  expenditures  and make  contributions,  including  interest,  to  the  reclamation
funds ($1.8 million).
Monthly distributions for the second quarter of 2007 were $0.20 per unit. Revisions, if any, to the monthly distribution
are normally announced on a quarterly basis in the context of prevailing and anticipated commodity prices at that time.
The items that may be deducted from Cash Flow to arrive at distributions to unitholders and the methodology used to
determine distributions is detailed in the Trust’s December 31, 2006 MD&A.

Taxation of Distributions
Distributions comprise a return of capital portion (tax deferred) and a return on capital portion (taxable). The return of
capital component reduces the cost basis of the trust units held. For 2007, it is estimated that distributions paid in the 
calendar year will be in the range of 95 to 100 per cent return on capital (taxable) and zero to five per cent return of 
capital (tax deferred).  For a more detailed breakdown, please visit our website at www.arcenergytrust.com.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
The Trust has contractual  obligations in the normal course of  operations including purchase of assets and services, 
operating  agreements,  transportation  commitments,  sales  commitments,  royalty obligations,  and  lease  rental 
obligations. These obligations are of a recurring and consistent nature and impact Cash Flow in an ongoing manner.
The  Trust  also  has  contractual  obligations  and  commitments  that  are  of  a  less  routine  nature  as  disclosed  in  the
following table.
Following is a summary of the Trust’s contractual obligations and commitments as at June 30, 2007:

Long-term and short-term debt, excluding interest. 
Fixed interest payments on senior secured notes. 
Contribution commitments to a restricted reclamation fund associated with the Redwater property. 
Fixed premiums to be paid in future periods on certain commodity derivative contracts.
The above noted debt repayments include the revolving credit facility. The lenders review the credit facility each year
and determine whether they will extend the revolving periods for another year. In the event that the credit facility is not 
extended at any time before the maturity date, the loan balance will become payable on the maturity date which is April 
15, 2010.
The  above  noted  derivative  contract  premiums  are  part  of  the  Trust’s  commitments  related  to  its  risk  management
program. In addition to the above premiums, the Trust has other commitments related to its risk management program.
As the premiums are part of the underlying derivative contract, they have been recorded at fair market value at June 30, 
2007 on the balance sheet as part of risk management contracts.
The Trust enters into commitments for capital expenditures in advance of the expenditures being made. At any given 
point in time, it is estimated that the Trust has committed to capital expenditures equal to approximately one quarter of 
its capital budget by means of giving the necessary authorizations to incur the capital in a future period. The Trust’s
2007  capital  budget  has  been  approved  by  the  Board  at  $360  million  and  subsequently  revised  downward  to  $350
25
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 26
million due to anticipated cost savings. This commitment has not been disclosed in the commitment table as it is of a
routine nature and is part of normal course of operations for active oil and gas companies and trusts.
The above noted operating leases include amounts for the Trust’s head office lease. The current lease expires in May 
2010.  The  Trust  expects  to  commit  to  a  new lease  within the  next  12  months  that  will  then  be  reflected  in  the 
commitments table.
The Trust is involved in litigation and claims arising in the normal course of operations. Management is of the opinion
that pending litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Trust’s financial position or results of operations
and therefore the following table does not include any commitments for outstanding litigation and claims.
The Trust has certain sales contracts with aggregators whereby the price received by the Trust is dependent upon the
contracts entered into by the aggregator. This commitment has not been disclosed in the commitment table as it is of a
routine nature and is part of normal course of operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
The Trust  has  certain  lease  agreements,  all  of  which  are  reflected  in  the  Contractual  Obligations  and  Commitments
table  above,  which  were  entered into in the normal course of operations. All leases have been treated as  operating
leases whereby the lease payments are included in operating expenses or G&A expenses depending on the nature of 
the lease. No asset or liability value has been assigned to these leases in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2007.
Critical Accounting Estimates 
The  Trust  has  continuously evolved  and  documented  its  management  and  internal  reporting  systems  to  provide 
assurance that accurate, timely internal and external information is gathered and disseminated.
The Trust’s financial and operating results incorporate certain estimates including:
• estimated revenues, royalties and operating costs on production as at a specific reporting date but for which actual
revenues and costs have not yet been received;
• estimated capital expenditures on projects that are in progress; 
• estimated depletion, depreciation and accretion that are based on estimates of oil and gas reserves that the Trust
expects to recover in the future;
• estimated fair values of derivative contracts that are subject to fluctuation depending upon the underlying commodity
prices and foreign exchange rates;
• estimated  value  of  asset  retirement  obligations  that  are  dependent  upon  estimates  of  future  costs  and  timing  of
expenditures; and
• estimated future recoverable value of property, plant and equipment and goodwill.
26
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 27
The Trust has hired individuals and consultants who have the skills required to make such estimates and ensures that
individuals  or  departments  with  the  most  knowledge  of  the  activity  are  responsible  for  the  estimates.  Further,  past
estimates are reviewed and compared to actual results, and actual results are compared to budgets in order to make 
more informed decisions on future estimates.
The  ARC  leadership  team’s  mandate  includes  ongoing  development  of  procedures,  standards  and  systems  to  allow
ARC  staff  to  make  the  best  decisions  possible  and  ensuring  those  decisions  are  in  compliance with  the  Trust’s 
environmental, health and safety policies.
Internal Controls Update 
ARC is required to comply with Multilateral Instrument 52-109 “Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim 
Filings”, otherwise referred to as Canadian SOX (“C-Sox”). The 2007 certificate requires that the Trust disclose in the 
interim MD&A any changes in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Trust confirms that no such changes were made to the internal controls over financial reporting during the first six 
months of 2007.
Financial Reporting Update
During 2007, the Trust completed the implementation of the new CICA Handbook Section 3855, Financial Instruments 
– Recognition and Measurement, Section 1530, Comprehensive Income, and Section 3865, Hedges that deal with the
recognition and measurement of financial instruments at fair value and comprehensive income. See notes 2 and 9 in
the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
During the second quarter of 2006, presentation changes were made to combine the previously reported accumulated
earnings  and  accumulated  cash  distribution  figures  on  the  balance  sheet  into  a  single  deficit  balance.  Numbers 
presented for comparative purposes have been restated to reflect this change in presentation.
Accounting Changes 
Section 1506 permits voluntary changes in accounting policy only if they result in financial statements that provide more
reliable and relevant information. Changes in policy are applied retrospectively unless it is impractical to determine the
period or cumulative impact of the change. Corrections of prior period errors are applied retrospectively and changes in
accounting  estimates  are  applied  prospectively  by  including  these  changes  in  net  income.  In  addition,  disclosure is 
required for all future accounting changes when an entity has not applied a new source of GAAP that has been issued
but is not yet effective.
Future Accounting Changes 
On December 1, 2006, the CICA issued three new accounting standards: Handbook Section 1535, Capital Disclosures, 
Section 3862, Financial instruments – Disclosures, and Section 3863, Financial instruments – Presentation. These new 
standards will be effective on January 1, 2008.
27
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 28
Section 1535 specifies the disclosure of an entity’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital, quantitative
data about what the entity regards as capital, whether the entity has complied with any capital requirements, and if it
has not complied, the consequences of such non-compliance.  This Section is expected to have minimal impact on the
Trust’s financial statements.
Sections 3862 and 3863 specify a revised and enhanced disclosure on financial instruments.  Increased disclosure will
be required on the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and how the entity manages those risks.
Objectives and 2007 Outlook
Sustainability
The Trust believes that maintenance of production and reserves per unit on an ongoing basis are two key factors to 
assess  the  sustainability of  an  oil  and  gas  royalty  trust.  On  a  quarterly basis,  the  Trust  reviews  changes  in  our
production per unit measures while reserves per unit is analyzed on an annual basis. The Trust acquires, develops and
optimizes oil and natural gas properties in predominantly mature areas to generate a Cash Flow stream.  Due to the
risks  inherent  in  the  oil  and  gas  business,  including  particularly  the  volatility  of  commodity  prices,  there  can  be  no 
assurance  that with  the  present  or  even increased  levels of  capital  expenditures,  the  Trust  will  be  successful  in
achieving sustainability.
Due to natural production declines, the Trust must continually develop its reserves and/or acquire new reserves in an
effort to maintain reserves, production and Cash Flow levels on which distributions are paid. The Trust facilitates this by
utilizing a portion of Cash Flow to fund a portion of ongoing capital development activities and maintaining moderate
debt levels. Oil and gas royalty trusts hold assets that are depleting and unitholders should expect production, revenue,
Cash Flow and distributions to decline over the long-term if reserves cannot be economically replaced. The Trust has 
an  inventory  of  internal  development  prospects  that  ARC  believes  will  maintain  production  at  approximately  current 
levels for a minimum period of two years. The Trust anticipates employing a conservative distribution policy to provide
for  cash  funding  of  a  portion  of  ongoing  capital  development  programs  and  maintaining  low debt  levels  to  facilitate
further growth. The Trust measures its sustainability and success in terms of per unit distributions, production, reserves,
and Cash Flow in addition to the ability to maintain low debt levels and the annual replacement of reserves.

Represents daily average boe of production per thousand units. Calculated based on annual daily average production divided
by weighted average trust units outstanding including trust units issuable for exchangeable shares. 
Debt-adjusted indicates that all years as presented have been adjusted to reflect a nil net debt to capitalization. It is assumed
that additional trust units were issued at a period end price for the reserves per unit calculation and at an annual average price 
for the production per unit calculation in order to reduce the net debt balance to zero in each year. The debt-adjusted amounts
are presented to enable comparability of annual per unit values. 
Normalized indicates that all years as presented have been adjusted to reflect a net debt to capitalization of 15 per cent. It is 
assumed that additional units were issued (or repurchased) at a quarterly average price for the production per unit calculation
in  order  to  reduce  the  net  debt  balance  to 15  per  cent of  total  capitalization  each  quarter.  The  normalized  amounts  are
presented to enable comparability of annual per unit values.
Please refer to the Trust’s 2006 year end MD&A for a summary of the annual historical debt-adjusted and normalized
reserves per unit and reserve life index on which the Trust assesses performance and sustainability.
Since the second quarter of 2006, the Trust’s normalized production per unit has decreased modestly from 0.326 to
0.303 boe of daily average production per thousand trust units. The second quarter 2007 production per unit of 0.303 
was negatively impacted by maintenance activities and shut-in production. Production per unit of 0.303 was achieved
and the Trust paid $611.5 million in distributions ($3.00 per trust unit and 66 per cent of Cash Flow) over a five quarter
time period. The normalized production per unit is a key measure as it indicates the ability to generate Cash Flow from
core operations, which in turn impacts the level of cash that may be distributed to unitholders. The Trust expects to
replace production during the rest of 2007 from internal development opportunities.
To compare the Trust’s results with oil and gas companies that retain all of their Cash Flow to grow production and
reserves, the Trust looks at normalized and distribution-adjusted production per unit that calculates the total production
per initial investment with the assumption that distributions are reinvested through the DRIP plan. Consequently, the 
production per initial investment increases over time as the investor’s number of trust units increases with distribution 
reinvestment.  Unitholders  can  replicate  this  by  participating  in  the  DRIP  so  that  the  number  of  trust  units  they  own
increases over time.
The  Trust’s  distribution  policy  centres  on the  goal  of  providing  a  consistent  and  sustainable  level  of  distributions  to 
unitholders and to provide for future growth. The distributions as a per cent of Cash Flow are indicative of the Trust’s 
commitment to fund a portion of ongoing development activities with Cash Flow to enable long-term sustainability. On
an annual basis, the Trust’s distributions as a per cent of Cash Flow has declined over time as the Trust has addressed
29
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 30
the  issue  of  long-term  sustainability  while  setting  distribution  levels.  This  has  allowed  the  Trust  to  maintain  stable
distributions during the last five quarters.
Another  possible  measure  of  sustainability  is  the  comparison  of  net  income  to  distributions.  Net  income  is  an 
accounting  measure  that  incorporates  all  costs  including  depletion  expense  and  other  non-cash  expenses  whereas
Cash Flow measures the cash generated in a given period before the cost of the associated reserves. As net income is
sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices, it is expected that there will be deviations between annual net income and
distributions. The following table illustrates the annual excess or shortfall of distributions to net income.

(1) Guidance for the noted items were revised in the first quarter of 2007.  See the Trust’s first quarter 2007 MD&A for further
details.
Variances in the 2007 actual results as compared to guidance are as follows:
• With  operating  costs  higher  than  guidance  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2007 we  have  revised
guidance to $9.25 per boe for the full year 2007.   The Trust is continually pursuing cost control initiatives
in order to address ongoing pressures in the service industry.
30
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 31
•

•
•
Transportation  costs  were  higher  than  guidance  due  to an  increase  in  oil  volumes  being  trucked  in
Saskatchewan in response to the Enbridge pipeline restrictions. Annual costs are still expected to be in
line with our guidance of $0.70 per boe.
Cash G&A expenses were higher than guidance due to the fact that the Trust paid its April LTIP payment
in the second quarter. The cash expense is offset by a reversal of the non-cash expense in the quarter. 
The Trust expects cash G&A to be in-line with guidance for the full year of 2007.
The Trust is revising its 2007 guidance for annual capital expenditures to $350 million as a result of cost
savings anticipated in drilling costs due to a general slow down of Canadian drilling activity.
See the “Objectives and 2007 Outlook” section in the Trust’s annual 2006 MD&A for additional discussion
on the Trust’s key objectives.
Assessment of Business Risks 
The ARC management team is focused on long-term strategic planning and has identified the key risks, uncertainties
and  opportunities  associated with  the  Trust’s  business  that  can  impact  the  financial  results.  See  “Assessment  of
Business Risks” in the Trust’s 2006 Annual Report MD&A for a detailed assessment.
Forward-Looking Statement 
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements as to the Trusts internal projections, expectations or 
beliefs relating to future events or future performance within the meaning of the “safe harbour” provisions of the United
States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Act (Ontario). In some cases, forward-looking
statements can be identified by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expects”, “projects”, “plans”, “anticipates” 
and similar expressions. These statements represent management’s expectations or beliefs concerning, among other 
things,  future operating  results  and  various  components  thereof  or  the  economic  performance  of  ARC  Energy  Trust 
(“ARC” or “the Trust”). The projections, estimates and beliefs contained in such forward-looking statements are based
on  management’s  assumptions  relating  to  the  production performance  of  ARC’s  oil  and  gas  assets,  the  cost  and
competition for services throughout the oil and gas industry in 2007 and the continuation of the current regulatory and
tax regime in Canada, and necessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the business risks 
discussed in this MD&A, which may cause actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially
from  any  projections  of  future  performance  or  results  expressed  or  implied  by  such  forward-looking  statements.
Accordingly,  readers  are  cautioned  that  events  or  circumstances  could  cause  results  to  differ  materially  from  those 
predicted. The Trust does not undertake to update any forward looking information in this document whether as to new
information, future events or otherwise.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
June 30, 2007 and 2006 (unaudited) 
(all tabular amounts in $CDN millions, except per unit and volume amounts)
1.  SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies as the most recent
annual audited financial statements, except as highlighted in Note 2. The interim consolidated financial statement 
note  disclosures  do  not  include  all  of  those  required  by Canadian  generally accepted  accounting  principles
(“GAAP”) applicable for annual consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Trust’s 
2006 annual report.
2.  NEW ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Effective January 1, 2007, the Trust adopted three new accounting standards that were issued by the Canadian
Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  (“CICA”):  Handbook  Section  1530,  Comprehensive  Income,  Section  3855,
Financial  Instruments  –  Recognition  and  Measurement,  Section  3865,  Hedges,  and  Section  1506,  Accounting
Changes.  These  new accounting  standards  have  been  adopted prospectively  and,  accordingly, comparative
amounts  for  prior  periods  have  not  been  restated.  The  standards  provide  requirements  for  the  recognition  and
measurement of financial instruments and the use of hedge accounting.
Comprehensive Income 
Section 1530 introduces Comprehensive Income, which consists of Net Income and Other Comprehensive Income
(“OCI”).  OCI  represents  changes  in  Unitholders’  Equity  from  transactions  and  other  events  with  non-owner
sources, and includes unrealized gains and losses on financial assets classified as available-for-sale and changes
in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting. These
items  are  excluded  from  Net  Income  calculated  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  We  have  included  in  our  Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements a Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income for the changes in
these items during the first six months of 2007, while the cumulative changes in OCI are included in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), which is presented  as a new category  within Unitholders’ Equity on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement 
Section  3855  establishes  standards  for  recognizing  and  measuring  financial  assets,  financial  liabilities  and  non-
financial  derivatives.  Under  this  standard,  all  financial  instruments  are  required  to  be  measured  at  fair  value  on 
initial  recognition.  Measurement  in subsequent  periods  depends  on whether  the  financial  instrument  has  been
classified as held-for-trading, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, or other financial liabilities. 
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred for financial instruments classified or designated as held-for-trading.
For  other  financial  instruments,  transaction  costs  are  capitalized  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  assets  and 
liabilities held-for-trading are measured at fair value with changes in those fair values recognized in Net Income.
Financial assets held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities are measured at amortized
cost  using  the  effective  interest  method  of  amortization.  Available-for-sale  financial  assets  are  measured  at  fair
values  with unrealized gains  and  losses recognized in  OCI.  Investments  in  equity instruments  classified  as
available-for-sale that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured at cost.
Derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, including those derivatives
that are embedded in financial or non-financial contracts that are not closely related to the host contracts. Changes
in fair values of derivative instruments are recognized in Net Income with the exception of derivatives designated
as effective cash flow hedges.
Hedges 
Section  3865  specifies  the  criteria  that  must  be  satisfied  in  order  for  hedge  accounting  to  be  applied  and  the
accounting  for  fair  value  and  cash  flow hedges.  Hedge  accounting  is  discontinued prospectively  when  the 
derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, or the derivative is terminated or sold, or upon the sale or early
37
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 38
termination of the hedged item. The Trust has currently designated its financial electricity contracts as an effective
cash flow hedge.
In a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is 
recognized  in  OCI  while  the  ineffective  portion  is  recognized  in  Net  Income.  When  hedge  accounting  is
discontinued, the amounts previously recognized in AOCI are reclassified to Net Income during the periods when
the  variability  in  the  cash  flows of  the  hedged  item  affects  Net  Income.  Gains  and  losses  on  derivatives  are
reclassified immediately to Net Income when the hedged item is sold or early terminated.
Impact 
As  a  result  of  these  changes  in  accounting  policies,  on  January  1,  2007  the  Trust  has  recorded  $4.9  million  in
application of initial adoption in AOCI to reflect the opening fair value of its cash flow hedges, net of tax, which was
previously not recorded on the consolidated financial statements. The Trust has also recorded an increase of $7
million to its risk management asset and an increase of $2.1 million to its future income tax liability.
Accounting Changes 
Section 1506 permits voluntary changes in accounting policy only if they result in financial statements that provide
more  reliable  and  relevant  information.  Changes  in  policy  are  applied  retrospectively  unless  it  is  impractical  to
determine  the  period  or  cumulative  impact  of  the  change.  Corrections  of  prior  period  errors  are  applied
retrospectively and changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively by including these changes in Net 
Income. In addition, disclosure is required for all future accounting changes when an entity has not applied a new
source of GAAP that has been issued but is not yet effective.
Future Accounting Changes 
On  December  1,  2006,  the  CICA  issued  three  new accounting  standards:  Section  1535,  Capital  Disclosures, 
Section 3862, Financial Instruments – Disclosures, and Section 3863, Financial Instruments – Presentation.  These 
new standards will be effective on January 1, 2008.
Section  1535  specifies  the  disclosure  of  an  entity’s  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for  managing  capital, 
quantitative  data  about  what  the  entity  regards  as  capital,  whether  the  entity  has  complied  with  any  capital
requirements, and if it has not complied, the consequences of such non-compliance. This Section is expected to
have minimal impact on the Trust’s financial statements.
Sections 3862 and 3863 specify a revised and enhanced disclosure on financial instruments. These Sections will
require the Trust to increase disclosure on the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and how
the entity manages those risks.

4.  LONG-TERM INVESTMENT
During the second quarter of 2007, the Trust sold its equity investment in a private oil sands company for proceeds
of $33.3 million, resulting in a gain on sale of investment of $13.3 million. The original investment was purchased
for  $20  million. The  investment  in  the  shares  of  the  private  company was  considered  to  be  a  related  party
transaction due to common directorships of the Trust, the private company and the manager of a private equity
fund  that  held  shares  in  the  private  company.  The  $20 million  investment was  part  of  a  $325 million private 
placement  of  the  private  company.  In  addition,  certain  directors  and  officers  of  the  Trust  had  minor  direct  and 
indirect shareholdings in the private company.

Various borrowing options exist under the credit facility including prime rate advances, bankers’ acceptances and
LIBOR based loans denominated in either Canadian or U.S. dollars.  All drawings under the facility are subject to
stamping fees that vary between 60 bps and 110 bps depending on certain consolidated financial ratios.
The following represents the significant financial covenants governing the credit facility:
•
•
•
Long-term debt and letters of credit not to exceed three times net income before non-cash items and
interest expense; 
Long-term debt, letters of credit, and subordinated debt not to exceed four times net income before
non-cash items and interest expense; and 
Long-term debt and letters of credit not to exceed 50 per cent of unitholders’ equity and long-term
debt, letters of credit, and subordinated debt.
In the event that the Trust enters into a material acquisition whereby the purchase price exceeds 10 per cent of the
book value of the Trust’s assets, the ratios in the first two covenants above are increased to 3.5 and 5.5 times, 
respectively  for  a  maximum  period  of  two  fiscal  quarters  following  the  closing  of  the  material  acquisition.   As  at
39
ARC_q2  8/8/07  9:33 AM  Page 40
June  30,  2007,  the  Trust  was  in  compliance  with  all  covenants  and  had  $4.7  million  in  letters  of  credit  and  no
subordinated debt.
The weighted average effective interest rate under the credit facility was 5.4 per cent for the three months ended
June 30, 2007 (5.4 per cent in 2006) and 5.5 per cent for the six months ended June 30, 2007 (5.0 per cent in
2006).
Amounts  due under the senior secured notes in the next  12  months  of  US$6 million have  not been included in
current liabilities as management has the ability and intent to refinance this amount through the syndicated credit
facility.
Interest paid during the period did not differ significantly from interest expense.

INCOME TAXES
On  June  12,  2007,  Bill  C-52  (“Bill”)  received  third  reading  in  the  House  of  Commons  and,  therefore,  was
considered “substantively enacted” for Canadian GAAP.  The Bill enacts the October 31, 2006 proposals to impose
a new tax on distributions from publicly traded income trusts.  As a result, the future tax position of the Trust, the
parent entity, is now required to be reflected in the consolidated future income tax calculation.
The  tax  provision  differs  from  the  amount  computed  by applying  the  combined  Canadian  federal  and  provincial
statutory income tax rates to income before future income tax recovery as follows:
Income before future income tax expense and recovery
Expected income tax expense at statutory rates
Effect on income tax of:
Net income of the Trust 
Non-taxable portion of gains/losses 
Effect of change in corporate tax rate
Resource allowance
Change in estimated pool balances
Non-deductible crown charges
Capital Tax 
Other non-deductible items
Initial recognition of Trust tax pools

The Trust uses a variety of derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and 
foreign exchange rates.  The Trust considers all of these transactions to be effective economic hedges, however, 
the majority of the Trust’s contracts do not qualify as effective hedges for accounting purposes.

Starting in 2009, the notional amount of the contracts decreases annually until 2014.  The Trust pays the floating interest rate based on a 
three month LIBOR plus a spread and receives the fixed interest rate.
The  Trust  has  designated  all  fixed  price  electricity  contracts  as  effective  accounting  hedges  on  their  respective 
contract dates. A realized loss of $0.1 million and $0.7 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 
2007  respectively  ($0.4  million  and  $0.5  respectively  in  2006)  on  the  electricity  contracts  has  been  included  in 
operating costs. The unrealized fair value gain on the electricity contracts of $10.2 million has been recorded on 
the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2007 with the movement in fair value recorded in OCI, net of tax.
The Trust has entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the Company’s interest rate exposure on debt 
instruments.  Prior to 2007, these contracts were designated as effective accounting hedges on the contract date.  
At  January  1,  2007  the  Trust  elected  to  cease  applying  hedge  accounting  to  these  contracts.    As  a  result,  the 
unrealized  fair  value  loss  on  the  interest  rate  swap  contracts  of  $2.4  million  has  been  reflected  in  the  income 
statement for the six months ended June 30, 2007.

At  June  30,  2007,  the  fair  value  of  the  contracts  that  were  not  designated  as  accounting  hedges  was  a  loss  of 
$18.8 million.  The Trust recorded a loss on risk management contracts of $2.8 million in the statement of income 
for the first six months of 2007 ($0.8 million gain in 2006).  This amount includes the realized and unrealized gains

13. RECONCILIATION OF CASH FLOW AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Distributions  are  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  Trust  Indenture.  To  arrive  at  distributions,  cash  flow  from 
operations adjusted for changes in non-cash working capital and expenditures on site restoration and reclamation,
is  reduced  by  reclamation  fund  contributions  including  interest  earned  on  the  funds  and  a  portion  of  capital
expenditures, and debt repayments. The portion of Cash Flow withheld to fund capital expenditures and to make
debt repayments is at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

The  Trust  recorded  nominal  compensation expense  for  the  first  six  months  of  2007  ($2.5  million  in  the  first  six 
months of 2006) for the cost associated with the rights.  The compensation expense was based on the fair value of
all  outstanding rights in the second quarter  of 2007 and is amortized over the remaining vesting period of such

rights.  Of the 3,013,569 rights issued on or after January 1, 2003 that were subject to recording compensation 
expense, 357,999 rights have been cancelled and 2,410,269 rights have been exercised to June 30, 2007.

1 5 . WHOLE UNIT INCENTIVE PLAN
The  Trust  recorded  compensation  expense  of  $4.3  million  and  $0.6  million  to  general  and  administrative  and 
operating expenses, respectively, and capitalized $0.8 million to property, plant and equipment in the six months 
ended June 30, 2007 for the estimated cost of the plan ($7.8 million, $1.4 million and $1.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2006). The compensation expense was based on the June 30, 2007 unit price of $21.74 ($28.00 at 
June  30,  2006),  accrued  distributions,  a  weighted  average performance  multiplier  of  1.6  (2.0  in  2006),  and  the
number of units to be issued on maturity.

(1) Weighted average trust units excludes trust units issuable for exchangeable shares.
(2)
Diluted trust units include trust units issuable for outstanding exchangeable shares at the period end exchange ratio. 
All outstanding rights were dilutive and therefore all have been included in the diluted trust unit calculation for both 2007
and 2006.
(3)
Basic  net  income  per  unit  has  been  calculated  based  on  net  income  after  non-controlling  interest  divided  by
weighted average trust units outstanding. Diluted net income per unit has been calculated based on net income
before non-controlling interest divided by diluted trust units.
