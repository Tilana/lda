Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 10, 2005, the Compensation Committee in connection with its annual review of executive compensation
and performance increased the salaries of all executive officers by an amount ranging from 6.1% to 25% of their
previous base salaries. The base salary for Jack Moore was increased 16.7% to reflect his promotion to Senior Vice
President in July 2005. The base salary for John Carne was increased 25% to reflect increased job responsibilities
due to the recent acquisitions. The base salaries in Sheldon Erikson's and Franklin Myers' employment agreements
were increased by 10.5% and 10.5%, respectively. Increases for the executive officers were given to better align their
salaries with comparable salaries offered by other employers.
Additionally, the Committee approved the grant of stock options to purchase shares of common stock for the following
executive officers of the Company: Sheldon R. Erikson 150,000; Franklin Myers 50,000; Jack B. Moore 45,000; John
Carne 45,000; William C. Lemmer 30,000; Robert J. Rajeski 25,000; Dalton L. Thomas 20,000; Jane C. Schmitt
20,000 and Charles M. Sledge 18,000. The options vest in annual increments of one-third each year and have a term
of seven years. Also, the Committee approved the grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards to executive officers,
effective January 1, 2006. The Awards are performance-based and the value of the Award will be based on the
Company's attainment of goals under the Company's annual bonus plan and will be equal to the bonus the executive
officer actually earns under the Company's annual bonus plan for 2006. The conversion into restricted stock units will
be based on the closing price of the Company common stock on December 31, 2005.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
