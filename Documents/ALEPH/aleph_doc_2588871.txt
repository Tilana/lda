TRANSOCEAN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1—Business
Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, “Transocean,” “we,” “us” 
or  “our”)  is  a  leading  international  provider  of  offshore  contract  drilling  services  for  oil  and  gas  wells.    We  specialize  in  technically 
demanding sectors of the offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.  Our 
mobile offshore drilling fleet is considered one of the most versatile fleets in the world.  We contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and 
work crews predominantly on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.  At June 30, 2016, we owned or had partial ownership interests in 
and operated 60 mobile offshore drilling units, including 29 ultra-deepwater floaters, seven harsh environment floaters, four deepwater 
floaters,  10 midwater  floaters  and  10 high-specification  jackups.    At  June 30,  2016,  we  also  had  five ultra-deepwater  drillships  and 
five high-specification jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed.  See Note 8—Drilling Fleet.
On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the par value of each of our 
shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00.  Following formal notification to creditors and establishment of a public deed 
of compliance, the reduction of par value became effective as of January 7, 2016, upon registration in the commercial register.  See 
Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity.
See Note 15—Subsequent Events.
Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies
Presentation—We  have  prepared  our  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to 
Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Pursuant to such rules and regulations, 
these financial statements do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. for complete 
financial statements.  The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, 
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods.  Such adjustments are 
considered to be of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise noted.  Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future period.  The 
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated 
financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  as  of  December 31,  2015  and  2014  and  for  each  of  the  three years  in  the  period  ended 
December 31, 2015 included in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2016.
Accounting estimates—To prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
U.S., we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses 
and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those 
related to our allowance for doubtful accounts, materials and supplies obsolescence, property and equipment, assets held for sale, income 
taxes, contingencies, share-based compensation, defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits.  We base our estimates 
and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources.  Actual results could differ from such estimates.
Fair value measurements—We estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability.  Our valuation techniques require 
inputs  that  we  categorize  using  a  three-level  hierarchy,  from  highest  to  lowest  level  of  observable  inputs,  as  follows:  (1) significant 
observable inputs, including unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (“Level 1”), (2) significant other 
observable inputs, including direct or indirect market data for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in 
less active markets (“Level 2”) and (3) significant unobservable inputs, including those that require considerable judgment for which there 
is  little  or  no  market  data  (“Level 3”).    When  multiple  input  levels  are  required  for  a  valuation,  we  categorize  the  entire  fair  value 
measurement  according  to  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  measurement  even  though  we  may  have  also  utilized 
significant inputs that are more readily observable.
Capitalized interest—We capitalize interest costs for qualifying construction and upgrade projects.  In the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2016, we capitalized interest costs of $40 million and $89 million, respectively, for construction work in progress.  In the 
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we capitalized interest costs of $29 million and $55 million, respectively, for construction work 
in progress.
Reclassifications—We  have  made  certain  reclassifications  to  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  with  the  current  period’s 
presentation.  Such reclassifications did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows.
Subsequent  events—We  evaluate  subsequent  events  through  the  time  of  our  filing  on  the  date  we  issue  our  financial
statements.  See Note 15—Subsequent Events.

Note 3—New Accounting Pronouncements 
Recently issued accounting standards
Presentation of financial statements—Effective with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2016, we will adopt 
the accounting standards update that requires us to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that 
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are 
issued.  The update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim and annual periods thereafter.  We 
do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial 
statements.
Stock  compensation—Effective  no  later  than  our  annual  report  for  the  year  ending  December 31,  2016,  we  will  adopt  the 
accounting standards update that allows for simplification of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income 
tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The update, 
which  permits  early  adoption,  is  effective  for  the  annual  period  ending  after  December 15,  2016  and  for  interim  and  annual  periods 
thereafter do not expect that our adoption will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, 
operations and cash flows or the notes thereto.
Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers—Effective  January 1,  2018,  we  will  adopt  the  accounting  standards  update  that 
requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The update, which permits early adoption, 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the requirements to determine the 
effect such requirements may have on our condensed consolidated statements of financial position, operations and cash flows and on the 
disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
Leases—Effective no later than January 1, 2019, we will adopt the accounting standards update that (a) requires lessees to 
recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases, and (b) updates previous accounting standards for lessors to align 
certain requirements with the updates to lessee accounting standards and the revenue recognition accounting standards.  The update, 
which permits early adoption, is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018.  We are evaluating the 
requirements  to  determine  the  effect  such  requirements  may  have  on  our  condensed  consolidated  statements  of  financial  position, 
operations and cash flows and on the disclosures contained in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 4—Variable Interest Entities
Angola  Deepwater  Drilling  Company Limited  (“ADDCL”),  a  consolidated  Cayman  Islands  company,  and  Transocean  Drilling 
Services Offshore Inc. (“TDSOI”), a consolidated British Virgin Islands company, are variable interest entities for which we are the primary 
beneficiary.    Accordingly,  we  consolidate  the  operating  results,  assets  and  liabilities  of  ADDCL  and  TDSOI.    The  carrying  amounts 
associated  with  our  consolidated  variable  interest  entities,  after  eliminating  the  effect  of  intercompany  transactions,  were  as  follows

Note 5—Impairments
Assets held for sale—In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate loss of $20 million ($18 million, or 
$0.04 per  diluted  share,  net  of  tax)  associated  with  the  impairment  of  the  deepwater  floater  Sedco 702,  along  with  related  and  other 
equipment.  In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate loss of $23 million ($20 million, or 0.05 per diluted share, 
net of tax), associated with the impairment of the deepwater floater Sedco 702 and the midwater floater Transocean John Shaw, along with 
related and other equipment, which were classified as assets held for sale at the time of impairment.
In the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized an aggregate loss of $222 million ($144 million, or $0.39 per diluted 
share, net of tax), associated with the impairment of the ultra-deepwater floater GSF Explorer, the deepwater floater GSF Celtic Sea and 
the midwater floater Transocean Amirante along with related equipment, which were classified as held for sale at the time of impairment.  
In the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized an aggregate loss of $651 million ($537 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, net of 
tax),  associated  with  the  impairment  of  the  ultra-deepwater  floaters  Deepwater Expedition  and  GSF Explorer,  the  deepwater  floaters 
GSF Celtic Sea, Sedco 707 and Transocean Rather and the midwater floaters GSF Aleutian Key, GSF Arctic III, Transocean Amirante and 
Transocean Legend, along with related equipment, which were classified as assets held for sale at the time of impairment.

We measured the impairment of the drilling units and related equipment as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded 
the  estimated  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.    We  estimated  the  fair  value  of  the  assets  using  significant  other  observable  inputs, 
representative of Level 2 fair value measurements, including indicative market values for the drilling units and related equipment to be sold 
for scrap value.  If we commit to plans to sell additional rigs for values below the respective carrying amounts, we may be required to 
recognize additional losses in future periods associated with the impairment of such assets.
Assets held and used—During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we identified indicators that the asset groups in our 
contract drilling services reporting unit may not be recoverable.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we identified additional 
indicators that the asset groups in our contract drilling services reporting unit may not be recoverable.  Such indicators included a reduction 
in the number of new contract opportunities, customer suspensions of drilling programs, early contract terminations and cancellations and 
low dayrate fixtures.  Our deepwater and midwater asset groups, in particular, experienced significant declines in projected dayrates and 
utilization caused by increased competition and marginalization of some of the less capable drilling units.  As a result of our testing, we 
determined that the carrying amounts of the deepwater floater and midwater floater asset groups were impaired.  In the three months 
ended March 31, 2015, we recognized a loss of $507 million ($481 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, net of tax) associated  with the 
impairment of our deepwater floater asset group, including a loss of $41 million associated with construction in progress for the asset 
group.  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a loss of $668 million ($653 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, 
net of tax) associated with the impairment of our midwater floater asset group, including a loss of $11 million associated with construction 
in progress for the asset group.
We estimated the fair value of the asset groups by applying a combination of income and cost approaches, using projected 
discounted cash flows and estimates of the exchange price that would be received for the assets in the principal or most advantageous 
market for the assets in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date.  Our estimates of fair value 
required us to use significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement, including assumptions related to 
the future performance of our contract drilling services reporting unit, such as future commodity prices, projected demand for our services, 
rig availability and dayrates.  If we experience increasingly unfavorable changes to actual or anticipated dayrates or other impairment 
indicators, or if we are unable to secure new or extended contracts for our active units or the reactivation of any of our stacked units, we 
may be required to recognize additional losses in future periods as a result of impairments of the carrying amount of one or more of our 
asset groups.
Note 6—Income Taxes
Tax  rate—Transocean Ltd.,  a  holding  company  and  Swiss  resident,  is  exempt  from  cantonal  and  communal  income  tax  in 
Switzerland, but is subject to Swiss federal income tax.  At the federal level, qualifying net dividend income and net capital gains on the 
sale  of  qualifying  investments  in  subsidiaries  are  exempt  from  Swiss  federal  income  tax.    Consequently,  Transocean Ltd.  expects 
dividends from its subsidiaries and capital gains from sales of investments in its subsidiaries to be exempt from Swiss federal income tax.
Our provision for income taxes is based on the tax laws and rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn 
income.  The relationship between our provision for or benefit from income taxes and our income or loss before income taxes can vary 
significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of income before income taxes, (b) changes in the 
blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues rather than income before taxes, (c) rig movements between taxing jurisdictions 
and (d) our rig operating structures.  Generally, our annual marginal tax rate is lower than our annual effective tax rate.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our estimated effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 21.5 percent 
and 21.6 percent, respectively, based on estimated annual income from continuing operations before income taxes.  In the six months 
ended June 30, 2016, such discrete items were primarily related to the tax expense or benefits of changes in unrecognized tax benefits 
associated with tax positions taken in prior years and valuation allowances for losses not expected to be realized.  In the six months ended 
June 30, 2015, such discrete items were primarily related to the tax effect of insurance recoveries that resulted from the resolution of 
certain matters associated with the Macondo well incident and losses on impairment of certain assets.
Tax returns—We file federal and local tax returns in several jurisdictions throughout the world.  With few exceptions, we are no 
longer subject to examinations of our U.S. and non-U.S. tax matters for years prior to 2010.  Our tax returns in the major jurisdictions in 
which we operate, other than the U.S., Norway and Brazil, which are mentioned below, are generally subject to examination for periods 
ranging  from  three to  six years.    We  have  agreed  to  extensions  beyond  the  statute  of  limitations  in  two major  jurisdictions  for  up  to 
20 years.  Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are examining our tax returns and in some cases have issued assessments.  We are 
defending our tax positions in those jurisdictions.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the timing or the outcome of these 
proceedings, we do not expect the ultimate liability to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial 
position or results of operations, although it may have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.
U.S. tax investigations—In January 2014, we received a draft assessment from the U.S. tax authorities related to our 2010 and 
2011 U.S. federal income tax returns.  The significant issue raised in the assessment was related to transfer pricing for certain charters of 
drilling  rigs  between  our  subsidiaries.    In  April 2016,  we  entered  into  a  final  settlement  with  the  U.S.  tax  authorities  for  $31 million, 
excluding interest and penalties, related to our 2010 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns.  The terms of this settlement are not

(Unaudited)
necessarily indicative of positions that the U.S. tax authorities may take on transfer pricing or other matters with respect to our tax returns 
for the years following 2011.  Such positions, if sustained, could substantially increase our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings and 
have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated results of operations or cash flows.
Norway  tax  investigations  and  trial—Norwegian  civil  tax  authorities  are  investigating  certain  transactions  undertaken  by  our 
subsidiaries in 1999, 2001 and 2002 as well as the actions of certain employees of our former external tax advisors on these transactions.  
At June 30, 2016, the remaining outstanding civil tax assessment was for NOK 412 million, equivalent to approximately $49 million, plus 
interest, related to a 2001 dividend payment.  On June 26, 2014, the Norwegian district court in Oslo ruled that our subsidiary was liable for 
the civil tax assessment but waived all penalties and interest.  On September 12, 2014, we and the tax authorities each appealed the 
ruling.  On June 27, 2016, the tax authorities withdrew their appeal of penalties and dropped all penalty claims.  We intend to take all other 
appropriate action to continue to support our position that our Norwegian tax returns are materially correct as filed.
We  had  previously  also  received  a  tax  assessment  for  NOK 43 million,  equivalent  to  approximately  $5 million,  plus  interest, 
related to certain foreign exchange deductions and dividend withholding tax.  On June 3, 2016, the Norwegian Supreme Court ruled that 
we were required to pay NOK 15 million, equivalent to approximately $2 million, excluding interest, with regard to the tax assessments for 
foreign exchange deductions and dividend withholding tax, and dismissed any interest and penalties.
Brazil  tax  investigations—Certain  of  our  Brazilian  income  tax  returns  for  the  years  2000  through  2004  are  currently  under 
examination.    In  December 2005,  the  Brazilian  tax  authorities  issued  an  aggregate  tax  assessment  of  BRL 793 million,  equivalent  to 
approximately $247 million, including penalties and interest, measured as of June 30, 2016.  On January 25, 2008, we filed a protest letter 
with the Brazilian tax authorities, and we are currently engaged in the appeals process.  On May 19, 2014, with respect to our Brazilian 
income tax returns for the years 2009 and 2010, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an aggregate tax assessment of BRL 134 million, 
equivalent to approximately $42 million, including penalties and interest, measured as of June 30, 2016.  On June 18, 2014, we filed a 
protest letter with the Brazilian tax authorities.  We believe our returns are materially correct as filed, and we are vigorously contesting 
these assessments.  An unfavorable outcome on these proposed assessments could result in a material adverse effect on our condensed 
consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other tax matters—We conduct operations through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Each 
country has its own tax regimes with varying nominal rates, deductions, employee contribution requirements and tax attributes.  From time 
to time, we may identify changes to previously evaluated tax positions that could result in adjustments to our recorded assets and liabilities.  
Although we are unable to predict the outcome of these changes, we do not expect the effect, if any, resulting from these adjustments to 
have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(a)  Transocean Inc., a 100 percent owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd., is the issuer of the notes and debentures.  Transocean Ltd. has provided a full 
and unconditional guarantee of the notes and debentures and borrowings under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.  Transocean Ltd. has no 
independent  assets  or  operations,  and  following  the  completion  of  certain  restructuring  transactions  executed  during  the  three months  ended 
June 30, 2016, its only other subsidiary not owned indirectly through Transocean Inc. was minor.  Transocean Inc. has no independent assets and 
operations, other than those related to its investments in non-guarantor operating companies and balances primarily pertaining to its cash and cash 
equivalents and debt.  Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. are not subject to any significant restrictions on their ability to obtain funds from their 
consolidated subsidiaries by dividends, loans or return of capital distributions.
Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility—In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated bank credit agreement, which 
established  a  $3.0 billion  unsecured  five-year  revolving  credit  facility,  that  is  scheduled  to  expire  on  June 28,  2019  (the  “Five-Year 
Revolving Credit Facility”).  Among other things, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility includes limitations on creating liens, incurring 
subsidiary debt, transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the sale of substantially all assets.  The Five-Year 
Revolving Credit Facility also includes a covenant imposing a maximum debt to tangible capitalization ratio of 0.6 to 1.0.  Borrowings under 
the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default, borrowings are guaranteed 
by Transocean Ltd. and may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty.
We may borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a 
margin (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin”), which ranges from 1.125 percent to 2.0 percent based on the credit rating of our 
non-credit  enhanced  senior  unsecured  long-term  debt  (“Debt Rating”),  or  (2) the  base  rate  specified  in  the  credit  agreement  plus  the 
Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin, less one percent per annum.  Throughout the term of the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, 
we pay a facility fee on the daily unused amount of the underlying commitment which ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent depending 
on our Debt Rating.  Effective May 17, 2016, as a result of a further reduction of our Debt Rating, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility 
Margin increased to 2.0 percent from 1.75 percent and the facility fee increased to 0.35 percent from 0.275 percent.  At June 30, 2016, 
based  on  our  Debt  Rating  on  that  date,  the  Five-Year  Revolving  Credit  Facility  Margin  was  2.0 percent  and  the  facility  fee  was 
0.35 percent.    At  June 30,  2016,  we  had  no borrowings  outstanding  or  letters  of  credit  issued,  and  we  had  $3.0 billion  of  available 
borrowing capacity under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.
Interest rate adjustments—The interest rates for certain of our notes are subject to adjustment from time to time upon a change 
to our Debt Rating.  Effective April 15, 2016, as a result of a reduction of our Debt Rating, the interest rates on the 2.5% Senior Notes due 
October 2017 (the “2.5% Senior Notes”) and the 3.8% Senior Notes due October 2022 (the “3.8% Senior Notes”) increased to 3.75 percent 
and 5.05 percent, respectively.  Effective June 15, 2016, as a result of a further reduction of our Debt Rating, the interest rates on the 
5.05% Senior Notes due December 2016 (the “5.05% Senior Notes”), the 6.375% Senior Notes due December 2021 (the “6.375% Senior
- 11 -

(Unaudited)
Notes”)  and  the  7.35% Senior  Notes  due  December 2041  (the  “7.35% Senior  Notes”)  increased  to  6.80 percent,  8.125 percent  and 
9.10 percent, respectively.  Effective October 15, 2016, as a result of a further reduction of our Debt Rating, the interest rates on the 
2.5% Senior Notes and the 3.8% Senior Notes will increase to 4.25 percent and 5.55 percent, respectively.
Debt repurchases—During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased in the open market an aggregate 
principal amount of $228 million of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $189 million.  As a result of the repurchases, we 
retired  the  respective  aggregate  principal  amounts  of  the  following  notes:  $36 million  of  the  5.05% Senior  Notes,  $38 million  of  the 
2.5% Senior  Notes,  $20 million  of  the  6.0% Senior  Notes  due  March 2018,  $26 million  of  the  7.375% Senior  Notes  due  April 2018, 
$13 million of the 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2020 (the “6.50% Senior Notes”), $44 million of the 6.375% Senior Notes, $38 million 
of the 3.8% Senior Notes, $8 million of the 7.45% Senior Notes due April 2027 and $5 million of the 7.5% Senior Notes due April 2031.  In 
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized an aggregate gain of $38 million associated with the retirement of such 
notes.
See Note 15—Subsequent Events.
Note 10—Postemployment Benefit Plans
As of June 30, 2016, we maintained certain funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in the U.S., under which benefits had 
ceased accruing (collectively, the “U.S. Plans”).  As of June 30, 2016, we also maintained defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom (the 
“U.K.”), under which benefits had ceased accruing, and in Norway, Nigeria and Indonesia (collectively, the “Non-U.S. Plans”).  We also 
maintained certain unfunded other postretirement employee benefit plans (collectively, the “OPEB Plans”), under which benefits to eligible 
participants diminish during a phase-out period ending December 31, 2025.
The components of net periodic benefit costs, before tax, and funding contributions for these plans were as follows (in millions):

Note 11—Contingencies 
Macondo well incident contingencies
Overview—On April 22, 2010, the ultra-deepwater floater Deepwater Horizon sank after a blowout of the Macondo well caused a 
fire and explosion on the rig off the coast of Louisiana.  At the time of the explosion, Deepwater Horizon was contracted to an affiliate of 
BP plc (together with its affiliates, “BP”).  Following the incident, we have been subject to civil and criminal claims, as well as causes of 
action, fines and penalties by local, state and federal governments.  Litigation commenced shortly after the incident, and most claims 
against us were consolidated by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Louisiana (the “MDL Court”).  A significant portion of the contingencies arising from the Macondo well incident has now been 
resolved  as  a  result  of  settlements  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  (the  “DOJ”),  BP,  the  states  of  Alabama,  Florida,  Louisiana, 
Mississippi, and Texas (collectively, the “States”) and the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee (the “PSC”).
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, in connection with settlements, as further described below, we recognized 
income of $788 million ($735 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, net of tax), recorded as a net reduction to operating and maintenance 
costs  and  expenses,  including  $538 million  associated  with  recoveries  from  insurance  for  our  previously  incurred  losses,  $125 million 
associated with partial reimbursement from BP for our previously incurred legal costs, and $125 million associated with a net reduction to 
certain related contingent liabilities, primarily associated with contingencies that were either settled or otherwise resolved as a result of 
settlements with BP and the PSC.
We  have  recognized  a  liability  for  the  remaining  estimated  loss  contingencies  associated  with  litigation  resulting  from  the 
Macondo well  incident  that  we  believe  are  probable  and  for  which  a  reasonable  estimate  can  be  made.    At  June 30,  2016  and 
December 31, 2015, the liability for estimated loss contingencies that we believe are probable and for which a reasonable estimate can be 
made was $250 million, recorded in other current liabilities.  We believe the remaining most notable claims against us arising from the 
Macondo well incident are the potential settlement class opt-outs from the PSC Settlement Agreement, as described below.  The liability 
for  estimated  loss  contingencies  at  June 30,  2016,  included,  among  others,  the  amount  we  have  agreed  to  pay  as  a  result  of  our 
settlement with the PSC (see “—PSC Settlement Agreement” below), which is subject to approval by the MDL Court.  The remaining 
litigation could result in certain loss contingencies that we believe are reasonably possible.  Although we have not recognized a liability for 
such loss contingencies, these contingencies could result in liabilities that we ultimately recognize.
We  recognize  an  asset  associated  with  the  portion  of  our  estimated  losses  that  we  believe  is  probable  of  recovery  from 
insurance and for which we have received from underwriters’ confirmation of expected payment.  Although we have available policy limits 
that could result in additional amounts recoverable from insurance, recovery of such additional amounts is not probable and we are not 
currently able to estimate such amounts (see “—Insurance coverage”).  Our estimates involve a significant amount of judgment.
Plea  Agreement—Pursuant  to  the  plea  agreement  (the  “Plea  Agreement”),  one of  our  subsidiaries  pled  guilty  to 
one misdemeanor count of negligently discharging oil into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, in violation of the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and agreed 
to  be  subject  to  probation  through  February 2018.    The  DOJ  agreed,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Plea  Agreement,  not  to  further 
prosecute us for certain matters arising from the Macondo well incident.
We  also  agreed  to  make  an  aggregate  cash  payment  of  $400 million,  including  a  criminal  fine  of  $100 million  and  cash 
contributions of $150 million to the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation and $150 million to the National Academy of Sciences, payable in 
scheduled installments.  In each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we made an aggregate cash payment of $60 million in 
satisfaction of amounts due under the Plea Agreement.  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of our liability for 
settlement obligations under the Plea Agreement was $60 million and $120 million, respectively.
Consent Decree—Under the civil consent decree (the “Consent Decree”), we agreed to undertake certain actions, including 
enhanced safety and compliance actions when operating in U.S. waters.  The Consent Decree also requires us to submit certain plans, 
reports and submissions and also requires us to make such submittals available publicly.  One of the required plans is a performance plan 
(the “Performance Plan”) that contains, among other things, interim milestones for actions in specified areas and schedules for reports 
required under the Consent Decree.  On January 2, 2014, the DOJ approved our proposed Performance Plan.  Additionally, in compliance 
with the requirements of the Consent Decree and upon approval by the DOJ, we have retained an independent auditor to review and 
report to the DOJ our compliance with the Consent Decree and an independent process safety consultant to review report and assist with 
the process safety requirements of the Consent Decree.
We may request termination of the Consent Decree after January 2, 2019, provided we meet certain conditions set forth in the 
Consent Decree.  The Consent Decree resolved the claim by the U.S. for civil penalties under the CWA.  The Consent Decree did not 
resolve the United States’ claim under the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”) for natural resource damages (“NRD”) or for removal costs.  However, 
BP has agreed to indemnify us for NRD and most removal costs (see “—BP Settlement Agreement”).

EPA Agreement—On  February 25,  2013,  we  and  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (the  “EPA”)  entered  into  an 
agreement (the “EPA Agreement”), which has a five-year term.  Subject to our compliance with the terms of the EPA Agreement, the EPA 
agreed that it will not suspend, debar or statutorily disqualify us and will lift any existing suspension, debarment or statutory disqualification.  
In the EPA Agreement, we agreed to comply with our obligations under the Plea Agreement and the Consent Decree and continue the 
implementation  of  certain  programs  and  systems  designed  to  enhance  our  environmental  management  systems  and  improve  our 
environmental  performance.    We  also  agreed  to  other  specified  actions,  including  the  (i) scheduled  revision  of  our  environmental 
management  system  and  maintenance  of  certain  compliance  and  ethics  programs;  (ii) compliance  with  certain  employment  and 
contracting procedures; (iii) engagement of an independent compliance auditor to, among other things, assess and report to the EPA on 
our  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  Plea Agreement,  the  Consent Decree  and  the  EPA Agreement  and  (iv) provision  of  reports  and 
notices  with  respect  to  various  matters,  including  those  related  to  compliance,  misconduct,  legal  proceedings,  audit  reports,  the 
EPA Agreement,  the  Consent Decree  and  the  Plea Agreement.    The  EPA Agreement  prohibits  us  from  entering  into,  extending  or 
engaging in certain business relationships with individuals or entities that are debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or similarly 
restricted.
BP  Settlement  Agreement—On  May 20,  2015,  we  entered  into  a  settlement  agreement  with  BP  (the  “BP Settlement 
Agreement”).  Under the BP Settlement Agreement, BP agreed to indemnify us for compensatory damages, including all NRD and all 
cleanup and removal costs for oil or pollutants originating from the Macondo well.  BP also agreed to cease efforts to recover as an 
unlimited  additional  insured  under  our  insurance  policies  and  to  be  bound  to  the  insurance  reimbursement  rulings  related  to  the 
Macondo well incident.  We agreed to indemnify BP for personal and bodily injury claims of our employees and for any future costs for the 
cleanup or removal of pollutants stored on the Deepwater Horizon vessel.  Additionally, we mutually agreed to release and withdraw all 
claims  we  have  against  each  other  arising  from  the  Macondo well  litigation  and  to  refrain  from  making  statements  regarding  gross 
negligence in the Macondo well incident.  In July 2015, pursuant to the BP Settlement Agreements, we received $125 million from BP as 
partial  reimbursement  of  the  legal  costs  we  incurred  in  connection  with  the  Macondo well  incident.    We  believe  the  BP Settlement 
Agreement  resolved  all  Macondo well-related  litigation  between BP  and  us,  and  the  indemnity  BP  committed  to  provide  will  generally 
address claims by third parties, including claims for economic and property damages, economic loss and NRD.  However, the indemnity 
obligations do not extend to fines, penalties, or punitive damages.
PSC Settlement Agreement—On May 29, 2015, together with the PSC, we filed a settlement agreement (the “PSC Settlement 
Agreement”) with the MDL Court for approval.  Through the PSC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to pay a total of $212 million, plus up 
to $25 million for partial reimbursement of attorneys’ fees, to be allocated between two classes of plaintiffs as follows: (1) private plaintiffs, 
businesses,  and  local  governments  who  could  have  asserted  punitive  damages  claims  against  us  under  general  maritime  law  (the 
“Punitive Damages Class”); and (2) private plaintiffs who previously settled economic damages claims against BP and were assigned 
certain claims BP had made against us (the “Assigned Claims Class”).  A court-appointed neutral representative established the allocation 
of the settlement payment to be 72.8 percent paid to the Punitive Damages Class and 27.2 percent paid to the Assigned Claims Class.  In 
exchange for these payments, each of the classes agreed to release all respective claims it has against us.  Members of the Punitive 
Damages Class may opt out of the PSC Settlement Agreement and pursue punitive damages claims against us, but we may terminate the 
PSC Settlement Agreement if the number of opt outs exceeds a specified threshold amount.  In June 2016 and August 2015, we made a 
cash deposit of $25 million and $212 million, respectively, into an escrow account pending approval of the settlement by the MDL Court.  
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of the escrow account was $237 million and $212 million, respectively, recorded in 
other current assets.
Multidistrict  litigation  proceeding—Most  Macondo well-related  claims  against  us  have  been  resolved  under  various 
settlements, described above.  There are, however, still pending claims by potential opt-outs from the settlement with the PSC and a 
number of other parties.  In September 2014, the MDL Court ruled on the liability phase trial, and additional litigation and appeals continue. 
The Phase One trial in 2013 addressed fault for the Macondo blowout and resulting oil spill.  The MDL Court’s September 2014 
Phase One ruling concluded that BP was grossly negligent and reckless and 67 percent at fault for the blowout, explosion, and spill; that 
we were negligent and 30 percent at fault; and that Halliburton Company (“Halliburton”) was negligent and three percent at fault.  The 
finding that we were negligent, but not grossly negligent, meant that,  subject to a successful  appeal, we would not be held liable for 
punitive damages and that BP was required to honor its contractual agreements to indemnify us for compensatory damages and release 
its  claims  against  us.    Our  settlements  with  BP  and  the  PSC  finally  resolve  the  indemnity  and  release  issues  (see  “—BP Settlement 
Agreement” and “—PSC Settlement Agreement”) and, upon court approval of such settlements, largely eliminate our risk should these 
determinations be reversed through the appeal process.  The MDL Court also concluded that we were an “operator” of the Macondo well 
for  purposes  of  33 U.S.C. § 2704(c)(3),  a  provision  of  OPA  that  permits  government  entities  to  recover  removal  costs,  such  as  costs 
associated  with  the  containment  and  removal  of  oil,  from  owners  and  operators  of  a  facility  or  vessel  that  caused  a  discharge.    The 
MDL Court, however, found that “Transocean’s liability to government entities for removal costs is ultimately shifted to BP by virtue of 
contractual indemnity,” and BP has agreed to indemnify removal costs for oil or containment originating in the Macondo well through the 
BP Settlement Agreement (see “—BP Settlement Agreement”).

TRANSOCEAN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(Unaudited)
The Phase One ruling did not quantify damages or result in a final monetary judgment.  However, because it is a determination 
of liability under maritime law, the Phase One ruling is appealable, and we, along with BP, the PSC, Halliburton and the State of Alabama 
have each appealed or cross-appealed aspects of the ruling.  These appeals have been stayed pending the finalization and court approval 
of BP’s settlement with the U.S. and the States.  As a result of our settlements, we do not expect any party to challenge the ruling with 
respect to Transocean when the appeals resume, and we expect that any remaining issues in the appeal would be addressed to the other 
parties.
We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these appeals, as to the timing of any further rulings, or that we will not 
enter into additional settlements as to some or all of the matters related to the Macondo well incident, including those to be determined at a 
trial, or the timing or terms of any such settlements.
Pending  claims—As  of  June 30,  2016,  numerous  complaints  remain  pending  against  us,  along  with  other  unaffiliated 
defendants in the MDL Court.  We believe our settlement with the PSC, if approved by the MDL Court, will resolve many of these pending 
actions.  As for any actions not resolved by these settlements, including any claims by individuals who opt-out of the PSC Settlement 
Agreement and federal securities actions, we are vigorously defending those claims and pursuing any and all defenses available.  See”—
PSC Settlement Agreement” and “—Federal securities claims.”
Federal securities claims—On September 30, 2010, a proposed federal securities class action was filed against us in the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In the action, a former shareholder of the acquired company alleged that the joint 
proxy statement related to our shareholder meeting in connection with the merger with the acquired company violated various securities 
laws and that the acquired company’s shareholders received inadequate consideration for their shares as a result of the alleged violations 
and sought compensatory and rescissory damages and attorneys’ fees.  On March 11, 2014, the District Court for the Southern District of 
New York dismissed the claims as time-barred.  Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the “Second 
Circuit”), but on March 17, 2016, the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal.  The time in which the plaintiffs may seek review by the U.S. 
Supreme Court has not yet expired.
State and other government claims—The majority of the state, local and non-U.S. government claims initially filed against us 
have either been settled or dismissed.  Claims filed by the Mexican federal government under the OPA and maritime law are pending 
review in the MDL Court.
Wreck removal—Under the BP Settlement Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify BP for any costs associated with wreck 
removal  for  the  Deepwater Horizon  vessel,  if  requested.    We  believe,  however,  that  the  likelihood  of  being  requested  to  remove  the 
wreckage from the sea floor is remote.
Insurance  coverage—At  the  time  of  the  Macondo well  incident,  our  excess  liability  insurance  program  offered  aggregate 
insurance  coverage  of  $950 million,  excluding  a  $15 million  deductible  and  a  $50 million  self-insured  layer  through  our  wholly  owned 
captive  insurance  subsidiary.    This  excess  liability  insurance  coverage  consisted  of  a  first and  a  second layer  of  $150 million  each,  a 
third and fourth layer of $200 million each and a fifth layer of $250 million.  We have recovered costs under the first four excess layers, the 
limits of which are now fully exhausted.  We have submitted claims to the $250 million fifth layer, which if paid, will exhaust such coverage.  
This layer is comprised of Bermuda market insurers (the “Bermuda Insurers”).  The Bermuda Insurers have asserted various coverage 
defenses to our claims, and we have issued arbitration notices to the Bermuda Insurers.
Other legal proceedings
Asbestos litigation—In 2004, several of our subsidiaries were named, along with numerous other unaffiliated defendants, in 
21 complaints filed on behalf of 769 plaintiffs in the Circuit Courts of the State of Mississippi, and in 2014, a group of similar complaints 
were  filed  in  Louisiana.    The  plaintiffs,  former  employees  of  some  of  the  defendants,  generally  allege  that  the  defendants  used  or 
manufactured  asbestos  containing  drilling  mud  additives  for  use  in  connection  with  drilling  operations,  claiming  negligence,  products 
liability,  strict  liability  and  claims  allowed  under  the  Jones  Act  and  general  maritime  law.    The  plaintiffs  generally  seek  awards  of 
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, but the court-appointed special master has ruled that a Jones Act employer defendant, 
such as us, cannot be sued for punitive damages.  At June 30, 2016, 15 plaintiffs have claims pending in Mississippi and eight plaintiffs 
have claims pending in Louisiana in which we have or may have an interest.  We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, although we 
can  provide  no  assurance  as  to  the  outcome.    We  have  historically  maintained  broad  liability  insurance,  although  we  are  not  certain 
whether insurance will cover the liabilities, if any, arising out of these claims.  Based on our evaluation of the exposure to date, we do not 
expect the liability, if any, resulting from these claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, 
results of operations or cash flows.
One of  our  subsidiaries  was  involved  in  lawsuits  arising  out  of  the  subsidiary’s  involvement  in  the  design,  construction  and 
refurbishment of major industrial complexes.  The operating assets of the subsidiary were sold and its operations were discontinued in 
1989, and the subsidiary has no remaining assets other than the insurance policies involved in its litigation, with its insurers and, either 
directly or indirectly through a qualified settlement fund.  The subsidiary has been named as a defendant, along with numerous other 
companies, in lawsuits alleging bodily injury or personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos.  As of June 30, 2016, the subsidiary 
was a defendant in approximately 259 lawsuits, some of which include multiple plaintiffs, and we estimate that there are approximately
- 15 -

(Unaudited)
281 plaintiffs in these lawsuits.  For many of these lawsuits, we have not been provided with sufficient information from the plaintiffs to 
determine whether all or some of the plaintiffs have claims against the subsidiary, the basis of any such claims, or the nature of their 
alleged injuries.  The first of the asbestos-related lawsuits was filed against the subsidiary in 1990.  Through June 30, 2016, the costs 
incurred to resolve claims, including both defense fees and expenses and settlement costs, have not been material, all known deductibles 
have been satisfied or are inapplicable, and the subsidiary’s defense fees and expenses and settlement costs have been met by insurance 
made available to the subsidiary.  The subsidiary continues to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits, and we cannot predict the 
number of additional cases in which it may be named a defendant nor can we predict the potential costs to resolve such additional cases 
or to resolve the pending cases.  However, the subsidiary has in excess of  $1.0 billion  in insurance limits potentially available to the 
subsidiary.  Although not all of the policies may be fully available due to the insolvency of certain insurers, we believe that the subsidiary 
will have sufficient funding directly or indirectly from settlements and claims payments from insurers, assigned rights from insurers and 
coverage-in-place settlement agreements with insurers to respond to these claims.  While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the 
outcome of these matters, we do not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from these claims will have a material impact on our 
consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Rio de Janeiro tax assessment—In the third quarter of 2006, we received tax assessments of BRL 464 million, equivalent to 
approximately $144 million, including interest and penalties, measured as of June 30, 2016, from the state tax authorities of Rio de Janeiro 
in Brazil against one of our Brazilian subsidiaries for taxes on equipment imported into the state in connection with our operations.  The 
assessments resulted from a preliminary finding by these authorities that our record keeping practices were deficient.  We currently believe 
that the substantial majority of these assessments are without merit.  We filed an initial response with the Rio de Janeiro tax authorities on 
September 9, 2006 refuting these additional tax assessments.  In September 2007, we received confirmation from the state tax authorities 
that  they  believe  the  additional  tax  assessments  are  valid,  and  as  a  result,  we  filed  an  appeal  on  September 27,  2007  to  the  state 
Taxpayer’s  Council  contesting  these  assessments.    While  we  cannot  predict  or  provide  assurance  as  to  the  final  outcome  of  these 
proceedings, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations 
or cash flows.
Brazilian import license assessment—In the fourth quarter of 2010, we received an assessment from the Brazilian federal tax 
authorities in Rio de Janeiro of BRL 600 million, equivalent to approximately $187 million, including interest and penalties, measured as of 
June 30, 2016, based upon the alleged failure to timely apply for import licenses for certain equipment and for allegedly providing improper 
information on import license applications.  We believe that a substantial majority of the assessment is without merit and are vigorously 
pursuing legal remedies.  The case was decided partially in favor of our Brazilian subsidiary in the lower administrative court level.  The 
decision  cancelled  the  majority  of  the  assessment,  reducing  the  total  assessment  to  BRL 40 million,  equivalent  to  approximately 
$12 million.  On July 14, 2011, we filed an appeal to eliminate the assessment.  On May 23, 2013, a ruling was issued that eliminated all 
assessment amounts.  A further appeal by the taxing authorities was filed in November 2014 and accepted for review in April 2015.  While 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect it to have a material adverse effect on 
our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Nigerian Cabotage Act litigation—In October 2007, three of our subsidiaries were each served a Notice and Demand from the 
Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, imposing a two percent surcharge on the value of all contracts performed by us in 
Nigeria pursuant to the Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act 2003 (the “Cabotage Act”).  Our subsidiaries each filed an originating 
summons  in  the  Federal  High  Court  in  Lagos  challenging  the  imposition  of  this  surcharge  on  the  basis  that  the  Cabotage Act  and 
associated levy is not applicable to drilling rigs.  The respondents challenged the competence of the suits on several procedural grounds.  
The court upheld the objections and dismissed the suits.  In December 2010, our subsidiaries filed a new joint Cabotage Act suit.  While 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect the proceedings to have a material 
adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other  matters—We  are  involved  in  various  tax  matters,  various  regulatory  matters,  and  a  number  of  claims  and  lawsuits, 
asserted and unasserted, all of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business.  We do not expect the liability, if any, resulting 
from these other matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the litigation matters specifically described above or of any such 
other pending, threatened, or possible litigation or liability.  We can provide no assurance that our beliefs or expectations as to the outcome 
or  effect  of  any  tax,  regulatory,  lawsuit  or  other  litigation  matter  will  prove  correct  and  the  eventual  outcome  of  these  matters  could 
materially differ from management’s current estimates.
Other environmental matters
Hazardous  waste  disposal  sites—We  have  certain  potential  liabilities  under  the  Comprehensive  Environment  Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state acts regulating cleanup of various hazardous waste disposal sites, including 
those described below.  CERCLA is intended to expedite the remediation of hazardous substances without regard to fault.  Potentially 
responsible parties (“PRPs”) for each site include present  and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the 
substances at the site.  Liability is strict and can be joint and several.

We  have  been  named  as  a  PRP  in  connection  with  a  site  located  in  Santa Fe  Springs,  California,  known  as  the  Waste 
Disposal, Inc. site.  Under a consent decree entered by the court, we and other PRPs agreed with the EPA and the DOJ to settle our 
potential liabilities for this site  by agreeing to  perform the remaining remediation required by the EPA.   The parties to the  settlement 
entered into a participation agreement, under which we agreed to pay for approximately eight percent of the remediation and related costs.  
The remediation is complete, and we believe our share of the future operation and maintenance costs of the site is not material.  There are 
additional potential liabilities related to the site, but these cannot be quantified, and we have no reason at this time to believe that they will 
be material.
One of our subsidiaries has been ordered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (“CRWQCB”) to develop a 
testing plan for a site known as Campus 1000 Fremont in Alhambra, California, which is now a part of the San Gabriel Valley, Area 3, 
Superfund site.  We were also advised that one or more of our subsidiaries that formerly owned and operated the site would likely be 
named  by  the  EPA  as  PRPs.    The  current  property  owner,  an  unrelated  party,  performed  the  required  testing  and  detected  no 
contaminants.  In discussions with CRWQCB staff, we were advised of their intent to issue us a “no further action” letter, but it has not yet 
been received.  Based on the test results, we would contest any potential liability.  We have no knowledge at this time of the potential cost 
of any remediation, who else will be named as PRPs, and whether in fact any of our subsidiaries is a responsible party.  The subsidiaries 
in question do not own any operating assets and have limited ability to respond to any liabilities.
Resolutions  of  other  claims  by  the  EPA,  the  involved  state  agency  or  PRPs  are  at  various  stages  of  investigation.    These 
investigations  involve  determinations  of  (a) the  actual  responsibility  attributed  to  us  and  the  other  PRPs  at  the  site,  (b) appropriate 
investigatory or remedial actions and (c) allocation of the costs of such activities among the PRPs and other site users.  Our ultimate 
financial responsibility in connection with those sites may depend on many factors, including (i) the volume and nature of material, if any, 
contributed to the site for which we are responsible, (ii) the number of other PRPs and their financial viability and (iii) the remediation 
methods and technology to be used.
It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential cost of these environmental matters, particularly in respect of remediation 
obligations.    Nevertheless,  based  upon  the  information  currently  available,  we  believe  that  our  ultimate  liability  arising  from  all 
environmental matters, including the liability for all other related pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal 
claims which are likely to be asserted, is adequately accrued and should not have a material effect on our consolidated statement of 
financial position or results of operations.
Letters of credit and surety bonds
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $90 million and $153 million, respectively, 
issued  under  various  committed  and  uncommitted  credit  lines  provided  by  several  banks  to  guarantee  various  contract  bidding, 
performance activities and customs obligations.  As is customary in the contract drilling business, we also have various surety bonds in 
place that secure customs obligations related to the importation of our rigs and certain performance and other obligations.  At June 30, 
2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding surety bonds totaling $31 million and $30 million, respectively.
Note 12—Shareholders’ Equity
Par value reduction—On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the 
par value of each of our shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00.  Following a formal notification to creditors and 
establishment of a public deed of compliance, the reduction of par value, which was approved at our extraordinary general meeting held on 
October 29, 2015, became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register.
Distributions  of  qualifying  additional  paid-in  capital—In  May 2015,  at  our  annual  general  meeting,  our  shareholders 
approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid-in capital in the form of a U.S. dollar denominated dividend of $0.60 per outstanding 
share, payable in four quarterly installments of $0.15 per outstanding share, subject to certain limitations.  In May 2015, we recognized a 
liability of $218 million for the distribution payable, recorded in other current liabilities, with a corresponding entry to additional paid-in 
capital.  On June 17 and September 23, 2015, we paid the first two installments in the aggregate amount of $109 million to shareholders of 
record  as  of  May 29  and  August 25,  2015.    On  October 29,  2015,  shareholders  at  the  extraordinary  general  meeting  approved  the 
cancellation of the third and fourth installments of the distribution.  As a result, we reduced our distribution payable, recorded in other 
current liabilities, by $109 million with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.
In May 2014, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid-in capital in 
the  form  of  a  U.S.  dollar  denominated  dividend  of  $3.00 per  outstanding  share,  payable  in  four quarterly  installments  of  $0.75 per 
outstanding share, subject to certain limitations.  On March 18, 2015, we paid the final installment in the aggregate amount of $272 million 
to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2015.
We did not pay the distribution of qualifying additional paid-in capital with respect to our shares formerly held in treasury or held
by our subsidiary.

Shares held in treasury—In May 2009, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved and authorized our board of 
directors,  at  its  discretion,  to  repurchase  an  amount  of  our  shares  for  cancellation  with  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  up  to 
CHF 3.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $3.6 billion.  On February 12, 2010, our board of directors authorized our management to 
implement  the  share  repurchase  program.    At  December 31,  2015,  we  held  2.9 million  shares  in  treasury,  recorded  at  cost.    On 
October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the cancellation of all shares that have been repurchased 
to date under our share repurchase program.  Following a formal notification to creditors and establishment of a public deed of compliance, 
the cancellation of our shares held in treasury became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register.
Shares held by subsidiary—One of our subsidiaries holds our shares for future use to satisfy our obligations to deliver shares 
in connection with awards granted under our incentive plans or other rights to acquire our shares.  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 
2015, our subsidiary held 5.6 million shares and 6.9 million shares, respectively.

Note 13—Noncontrolling Interest
Transocean Partners—At  June 30,  2016  and  December 31,  2015,  we  held  21.3 million  common  units  and  27.6 million 
subordinated  units  of  Transocean Partners  LLC,  a  Marshall  Islands  limited  liability  company  (“Transocean Partners”),  and  all  of  the 
incentive distribution rights.  The remaining publicly held common units represent the noncontrolling interest in Transocean Partners.
On  November 4,  2015,  Transocean Partners  announced  that  its  board  of  directors  approved  a  unit  repurchase  program, 
authorizing it to repurchase for cancellation up to $40 million of its publicly held common units.  Subject to market conditions, Transocean 
Partners may repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  It may suspend or discontinue 
the program at any time.  In the six months ended June 30, 2016, Transocean Partners repurchased 386,876 of its publicly held common 
units for an aggregate purchase price of $3 million.  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Transocean Partners had outstanding 
19.7 million  and  20.0 million  publicly  held  common  units,  respectively.    At  June 30,  2016  and  December 31,  2015,  the  common  and 
subordinated units held by us collectively represented a 71.3 percent and 70.9 percent, respectively, limited liability company interest in 
Transocean Partners.
In  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016  and  2015,  Transocean Partners  declared  and  paid  an  aggregate  distribution  of
$50 million to its unitholders, of which $14 million was paid to holders of noncontrolling interest.
See Note 15—Subsequent Events. 
TDSOI—In June 2016, we served notice of our intent to exercise our option to call the 30 percent ownership interest in TDSOI 
held by our local partner.  In June 2016, in connection with our notice, we recorded a liability of $2 million for the cash redemption amount, 
recorded in other current liabilities, that we will pay to our local partner upon completion of the transaction, with a corresponding entry to 
noncontrolling interest.  Additionally, we recorded a capital allocation resulting in an increase of $12 million to noncontrolling interest with a 
corresponding decrease to additional paid-in capital.  See Note 15—Subsequent Events.

We estimated the fair value of each class of financial instruments, for which estimating fair value is practicable, by applying the
following methods and assumptions:
Cash and cash equivalents—The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents represents the historical cost, plus accrued 
interest, which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of those instruments.  We measured the estimated fair value of our 
cash equivalents using significant other observable inputs, representative of a Level 2 fair value measurement, including the net asset 
values  of  the  investments.    At  June 30,  2016  and  December 31,  2015,  the  aggregate  carrying  amount  of  our  cash  equivalents  was 
$1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.
Restricted  cash  balances  and  investments—The  carrying  amount  of  the  restricted  cash  balances  that  are  subject  to 
restrictions due to legislation, regulation or court order approximates fair value due to the short term nature of the instruments in which the 
restricted cash balances are held.  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the aggregate carrying amount of such restricted cash 
balances was $281 million and $251 million, respectively.
The  carrying  amount  of  the  restricted  cash  investments  associated  with  the  Eksportfinans  Loans  due  January 2018  (the 
“Eksportfinans Restricted Cash Investments”) represents the amortized cost of our investment.  We measured the estimated fair value of 
the  Eksportfinans  Restricted  Cash  Investments  using  significant  other  observable  inputs,  representative  of  a  Level 2  fair  value 
measurement,  including  the  terms  and  credit  spreads  of  the  instruments.    At  June 30,  2016  and  December 31,  2015,  the  aggregate 
carrying amount of the Eksportfinans Restricted Cash Investments was $177 million and $216 million, respectively.  At June 30, 2016 and 
December 31,  2015,  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  Eksportfinans  Restricted  Cash  Investments  was  $182 million  and  $223 million, 
respectively.
Debt—We measured the estimated fair value of our debt, all of which was fixed-rate debt, using significant other observable
inputs, representative of a Level 2 fair value measurement, including the terms and credit spreads for the instruments.

Note 15—Subsequent Events
Transocean Partners—On July 31, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with 
Transocean Partners  and  two of  our  wholly  owned  subsidiaries.    Upon  the  closing  of  the  merger  as  contemplated  by  the 
Merger Agreement, Transocean Partners will merge with one of our subsidiaries, with Transocean Partners continuing as the surviving 
company as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.  Each of the Transocean Partners common units that is issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the closing, other than units held by Transocean and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to 
receive 1.1427 of our shares.  We expect that we will issue approximately 22.7 million shares in the merger.  The Transocean shares to be 
issued in the merger will be issued out of Transocean’s conditional capital.  No Transocean shareholder vote will be required to complete 
the merger.
The merger has been approved by a special committee of our board of directors, by the Transocean Partners board of directors 
and  the  Transocean Partners  conflicts  committee,  and  by  the  boards  of  directors  of  our  subsidiary  companies  that  are  parties  to  the 
Merger Agreement.  Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by the 
unitholders of Transocean Partners and other customary closing conditions.  We estimate that the closing of the merger will take place in 
the fourth quarter of 2016.
Debt  issuance—On  July 21,  2016,  we  completed  an  offering  of  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.25 billion  of  senior 
unsecured notes due July 15, 2023 (the “9.00% Senior Notes”), and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $1.21 billion, net of initial 
purchasers’ fees and estimated offering costs payable by us.  We will pay interest on the 9.00% Senior Notes semiannually on January 15 
and  July 15  of  each  year,  beginning  on  January 15,  2017.    The  9.00% Senior  Notes  are  fully  and  unconditionally  guaranteed  by 
Transocean Ltd. and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Transocean Inc.  The indenture that governs the 9.00% Senior Notes contains 
covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain liens on our drilling units without equally and ratably securing the notes, 
engage in certain sale and lease-back transactions covering any of our drilling units, allow our subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, 
and consolidate, merge or enter into a scheme of arrangement qualifying as an amalgamation.  We intend to use the net proceeds from 
the debt offering to complete a tender offer (see “Debt tender offer”) and for general corporate purposes.
Debt tender offer—On August 1, 2016, we completed a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase for cash up to $1.0 billion 
aggregate principal amount of our 6.50% Senior Notes, 6.375% Senior Notes and 3.80% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), 
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the related offer to purchase.  In connection with the Tender Offer, we received valid 
tenders  from  holders  of  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Tendered  Notes  as  follows:  $348 million  of  the  6.5% Senior  Notes, 
$476 million of the 6.375% Senior Notes and $157 million of the 3.80% Senior Notes.  We have made or expect to make an aggregate 
cash payment of $876 million to settle the Tendered Notes.  In the three months ending September 30, 2016, as a result of the retirement 
of the Tendered Notes, we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $104 million associated with the retirement of debt
TDSOI—In June 2016, we exercised our option to call the 30 percent ownership interest in TDSOI held by our local partner.  In 
July 2016, we completed the repurchase of the noncontrolling interest for a cash payment of $2 million, and as a result, TDSOI became 
our wholly owned subsidiary.

Business
Transocean Ltd.  (together  with  its  subsidiaries  and  predecessors,  unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  “Transocean,”  the 
“Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.  As of July 26, 
2016, we owned or had partial ownership interests in and operated 60 mobile offshore drilling units, including 29 ultra-deepwater floaters, 
seven harsh environment floaters, four deepwater floaters, 10 midwater floaters, and 10 high-specification jackups.  At July 26, 2016, we 
also had five ultra-deepwater drillships and five high-specification jackups under construction or under contract to be constructed.
We provide contract drilling services in a single, global operating segment, which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling 
fleet, related equipment and work crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells.  We specialize in technically demanding 
regions of the offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services.  We believe our 
drilling fleet is one of the most versatile fleets in the world, consisting of floaters and high-specification jackups used in support of offshore 
drilling activities and offshore support services on a worldwide basis.
Our  contract  drilling  services  operations  are  geographically  dispersed  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  development  areas 
throughout the world.  Although rigs can be moved from one region to another, the cost of moving rigs and the availability of rig-moving 
vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to fluctuate somewhat between regions.  Still, significant variations between regions 
do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility.  Our fleet operates in a single, global market for the provision of contract drilling 
services.  The location of our rigs and the allocation of resources to operate, build or upgrade our rigs are determined by the activities and 
needs of our customers.
Significant Events
Transocean Partners—On July 31, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with 
Transocean Partners  and  two  of  our  wholly  owned  subsidiaries.    Upon  the  closing  of  the  merger  as  contemplated  by  the 
Merger Agreement, Transocean Partners will merge with one of our subsidiaries, with Transocean Partners continuing as the surviving 
company as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Transocean Ltd.  Each of the Transocean Partners common units that is issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the closing, other than units held by Transocean and its subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to 
receive 1.1427 of our shares.  We expect that we will issue approximately 22.7 million shares in the merger.  The Transocean shares to be 
issued in the merger will be issued out of Transocean’s conditional capital.  No Transocean shareholder vote will be required to complete 
the merger.
The merger has been approved by a special committee of our board of directors, by the Transocean Partners board of directors 
and  the  Transocean Partners  conflicts  committee,  and  by  the  boards  of  directors  of  our  subsidiary  companies  that  are  parties  to  the 
Merger Agreement.  Consummation of the merger is subject to various conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by the 
unitholders of Transocean Partners and other customary closing conditions.  We estimate that the closing of the merger will take place in 
the fourth quarter of 2016.
Debt issuance—On July 21, 2016, we completed an offering of an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion of 9.00% Senior 
Notes due July 15, 2023 (the “9.00% Senior Notes”), and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $1.21 billion, net of initial purchasers’ 
fees and estimated offering costs payable by us.  See—Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 15—Subsequent 
Events and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources and uses of liquidity.”
Debt tender offer—On August 1, 2016, we completed a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase for cash up to $1.0 billion 
aggregate principal amount of our 6.50% Senior Notes due November 2020, 6.375% Senior Notes due December 2021 and 3.80% Senior 
Notes due October 2022 (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”).  As of the expiration of the Tender Offer, we received valid tenders from 
holders of an aggregate principal amount of $981 million of the Tendered Notes, and we have made or expect to make an aggregate cash 
payment of $876 million to settle the Tendered Notes.  In the three months ending September 30, 2016, as a result of the retirement of the 
Tendered Notes, we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $104 million associated with the retirement of debt.  See—Notes to 
Condensed  Consolidated  Financial  Statements—Note 15—Subsequent  Events  and  “—Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources—Sources  and 
uses of liquidity.”
Debt repurchases—In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we completed the settlements of transactions to repurchase in the 
open market an aggregate principal amount of $228 million of our debt securities for an aggregate cash payment of $189 million.  As a 
result, we recognized an aggregate gain of $38 million associated with the retirement of debt.  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Sources and uses of liquidity.”
Fleet  expansion—During  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016,  we  completed  construction  of  and  placed  into  service  the 
ultra-deepwater  floaters  Deepwater Proteus  and  Deepwater Thalassa.    See  “—Operating  Results”  and  “—Liquidity  and  Capital 
Resources—Drilling fleet.”
- 22 -
Drilling  contract  terminations  and  cancellations—As  a  result  of  recent  market  conditions,  we  have  observed  an 
unprecedented  level  of  early  drilling  contract  terminations  and  cancellations  in  the  contract  drilling  industry.    In  the  six months  ended 
June 30, 2016, we recognized revenues of $218 million associated with early terminations and cancellations of drilling contracts for six of 
our rigs.  See “—Outlook,” “—Operating Results” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources and uses of cash.”
Dispositions—During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we completed the sale of a deepwater floater and five midwater 
floaters,  along  with  related  equipment.    In  connection  with  the  sale  of  these  assets,  we  received  aggregate  net  cash  proceeds  of 
$11 million, and we recognized an aggregate net gain of $5 million.  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Drilling fleet.”
Impairments of long-lived assets—During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we committed to a plan to sell for scrap value 
a deepwater floater and a midwater floater, along with related equipment.  As a result, we recognized an aggregate loss of $23 million 
($20 million, net of tax) associated with the impairment of these assets.  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Drilling fleet.”
Norway  tax  investigations  and  trial—In  January 2016,  the  Norwegian  authorities  formally  and  unconditionally  dropped  all 
criminal  charges  against  our  subsidiaries  and  the  two employees  of  our  former  external  advisors  and  our  former  external  Norwegian 
attorney.  As a result, no criminal charges remain outstanding for any of the previously reported Norway tax investigations or trials and all 
our subsidiaries and external advisors have been fully acquitted of all criminal charges.
Markets for our shares—Our shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RIG” and were 
previously listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (“SIX”) under the symbol “RIGN.”  Effective March 31, 2016, our shares were delisted from 
the SIX.
Par value reduction—On October 29, 2015, shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the reduction of the 
par value of each of our shares to CHF 0.10 from the original par value of CHF 15.00.  The reduction of par value became effective as of 
January 7, 2016 upon registration in the commercial register.  See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 12—
Shareholders’ Equity.
Outlook
Drilling market—Our long-term view of the offshore drilling market remains positive, particularly for high-specification assets; 
however, the near to medium term remains very challenging.  Low commodity pricing due to the current surplus of oil continues to hamper 
energy spending.  Our customers remain focused on maintaining their capital allocation policies, reducing their costs and limiting their 
spend on exploration and development opportunities in 2016.  The risks of project delays, contract renegotiations and contract terminations 
will continue.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, our customers early terminated or cancelled contracts for Discoverer Americas, 
Polar Pioneer,  Sedco 714,  Sedco Energy  and  Transocean Spitsbergen.    Then,  in  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016,  we  received 
notices of early termination or cancellation of drilling contracts for Deepwater Champion, Deepwater Millennium, Discoverer Deep Seas, 
GSF Constellation II, GSF Development Driller I and Transocean John Shaw.
As expected, few new contracts have been awarded year to date, and this trend is likely to continue through the remainder of 
2016, resulting in falling rig utilization rates and exacerbating the negative pressure on rig pricing.  Over time, we believe the oversupply of 
oil will decrease as the current supply and demand imbalance narrows.  As spare oil capacity diminishes, we expect upward pressure on 
commodity  pricing  with  subsequent  increased  demand  for  drilling  rigs.    As  of  July 21,  2016,  our  contract  backlog  was  $13.7 billion 
compared to $14.6 billion as of April 21, 2016.
Fleet status—We present the availability of our rigs in terms of the uncommitted fleet rate.  The uncommitted fleet rate is defined 
as  the  number  of  uncommitted  days  divided  by  the  total  number  of  rig  calendar  days  in  the  measurement  period,  expressed  as  a 
percentage.  An uncommitted day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is idle or stacked, is not contracted to a customer and is 
not committed to a shipyard.  The uncommitted fleet rates exclude the effect of priced options.
As of July 21, 2016, uncommitted fleet rates for the remainder of 2016 and each of the subsequent four years in the period
ending December 31, 2020 were as follows:

Performance and Other Key Indicators
Contract backlog—Contract backlog is defined as the maximum contractual operating dayrate multiplied by the number of days 
remaining  in  the  firm  contract  period,  excluding  revenues  for  mobilization,  demobilization  and  contract  preparation  or  other  incentive 
provisions, which are not expected to be  significant to our  contract drilling revenues.  The  contract backlog represents the maximum 
contract drilling revenues that can be earned considering the contractual operating dayrate in effect during the firm contract period and 
represents the basis for the maximum revenues in our revenue efficiency measurement.  To determine maximum revenues for purposes of 
calculating revenue efficiency, however, we include the revenues earned for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, other 
incentive provisions or cost escalation provisions which are excluded from the amounts presented for contract backlog.  The contract 
backlog for our fleet was as follows:

Our contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts or, in some cases, by 
other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution.  Our contract backlog includes amounts associated with our newbuild units that 
are currently under construction.  The contractual operating dayrate may be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive or an 
alternative contractual dayrate, such as a waiting-on-weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain 
circumstances.  The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive because of a number 
of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations.  In certain contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, 
repairs extend beyond a stated period of time.
Average daily revenue—Average daily revenue is defined as contract drilling revenues earned per operating day.  An operating 
day is defined as a calendar day during which a rig is contracted to earn a dayrate during the firm contract period after commencement of 
operations.  The average daily revenue for our fleet was as follows:

Our average daily revenue fluctuates relative to market conditions and our revenue efficiency.  The average daily revenue may 
also be affected by revenues for lump sum bonuses or demobilization fees received from our customers.  Our total fleet average daily 
revenue is also affected by the mix of rig classes being operated, as deepwater floaters, midwater floaters and high-specification jackups 
are typically contracted at lower dayrates compared to ultra-deepwater floaters and harsh environment floaters.  We include newbuilds in 
the  calculation  when  the  rigs  commence  operations  upon  acceptance  by  the  customer.    We  remove  rigs  from  the  calculation  upon 
disposal, classification as held for sale or classification as discontinued operations.

Revenue efficiency—Revenue efficiency is defined as actual contract drilling revenues for the measurement period divided by 
the maximum revenue calculated for the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  Maximum revenue is defined as the greatest 
amount  of  contract  drilling  revenues  the  drilling  unit  could  earn  for  the  measurement  period,  excluding  amounts  related  to  incentive 
provisions.  The revenue efficiency rates for our fleet were as follows:

Our revenue efficiency rate varies due to revenues earned under alternative contractual dayrates, such as a waiting-on-weather 
rate, repair rate, standby rate, force majeure rate or zero rate, that may apply under certain circumstances.  We include newbuilds in the 
calculation when the rigs commence operations upon acceptance by the customer.  We exclude rigs that are not operating under contract, 
such as those that are stacked.
Rig utilization—Rig utilization is defined as the total number of operating days divided by the total number of rig calendar days
in the measurement period, expressed as a percentage.  The rig utilization rates for our fleet were as follows:

Our rig utilization rate declines as a result of idle and stacked rigs and during shipyard and mobilization periods to the extent 
these rigs are not earning revenues.  We include newbuilds in the calculation when the rigs commence operations upon acceptance by the 
customer.  We remove rigs from the calculation upon disposal, classification as held for sale or classification as discontinued operations.  
Accordingly, our rig utilization can increase when idle or stacked units are removed from our drilling fleet.

Operating  revenues—Contract  drilling  revenues  decreased  for  the  three months  ended  June 30,  2016  compared  to  the 
three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $685 million of decreased revenues resulting from 
additional rigs idle or stacked, (b) approximately $160 million of decreased revenues resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale 
and  (c) approximately  $75 million  of  decreased  revenues  resulting  from  lower  dayrates.    These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by 
approximately $70 million of increased revenues associated with our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the 
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Other revenues decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, due 
to approximately $56 million of decreased revenues resulting from drilling contracts early terminated or cancelled by our customers and 
$26 million of decreased revenues for reimbursable items.
Costs and expenses—Excluding the effect of $788 million resulting from cost reimbursements from settlements, recoveries 
from insurance and net adjustments to contingent liabilities associated with the Macondo well incident, operating and maintenance costs 
and expenses decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 by approximately 
$485 million.    These  decreases  were  primarily  due  to  the  following:  (a) approximately  $290 million  of  decreased  costs  and  expenses 
resulting from cost reductions for our idle or stacked rigs, (b) approximately $95 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from our 
active  fleet  primarily  resulting  from  fewer  shipyard,  mobilization  and  reduced  personnel  expenses,  (c) approximately  $75 million  of 
decreased costs and expenses resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale and (d) approximately $45 million of reduced onshore 
costs.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $20 million of increased cost and expenses associated with our newbuild 
ultra-deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Depreciation expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 
primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $33 million of decreased depreciation resulting from the impairment of our deepwater
- 26 -
floater and midwater floater asset groups in the year ended December 31, 2015 and (b) approximately $9 million of decreased depreciation 
resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $23 million of increased 
depreciation  resulting  from  our  newbuild  ultra-deepwater  drillships  and  other  property  and  equipment  that  were  placed  into  service 
subsequent to June 30, 2015.
Impairments—In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a loss of $20 million associated with the impairment of 
certain assets classified as held for sale.  In the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a loss of $668 million associated with 
the impairment of our midwater floater asset group and an aggregate loss of $222 million associated with the impairment of certain assets 
classified as held for sale.
Other  income and  expense—Interest  expense,  net  of  amounts  capitalized,  decreased  in  the  three months  ended  June 30, 
2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $11 million of increased interest 
capitalized as a result of our newbuild construction program and (b) approximately $26 million of decreased interest expense as a result of 
our  debt  repurchases  and  redemptions,  partially  offset  by  (c) approximately  $8 million  of  increased  interest  expense  as  a  result  of 
downgrades to the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt.
Income tax expense—We operate internationally and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in the countries 
in which we operate and earn income.  In the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, 
was 16.3 percent and 16.9 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense, after excluding 
certain items, such as losses on impairment and gains and losses on certain asset disposals.  The tax effect, if any, of the excluded items 
as well as settlements of prior year tax liabilities and changes in prior year tax estimates are all treated as discrete period tax expenses or 
benefits.  In the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of 
$5 million and net tax benefit of less than $1 million, respectively.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, these discrete tax 
items,  coupled  with  the  excluded  income  and  expense  items  noted  above,  resulted  in  an  effective  tax  rate  of  16.2 percent  and 
10.3 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
The  relationship  between  our  provision  for  or  benefit  from  income  taxes  and  our  income  before  income  taxes  can  vary 
significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of income before income taxes, (b) changes in the 
blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues versus income before taxes, (c) rig movements between taxing jurisdictions and 
(d) our rig operating structures.  Generally, our annual marginal tax rate is lower than our annual effective tax rate.  Consequently, our 
income tax expense does not change proportionally with our income before income taxes.  Significant decreases in our income before 
income  taxes  typically  lead  to  higher  effective  tax  rates,  while  significant  increases  in  income  before  income  taxes  can  lead  to  lower 
effective tax rates, subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense noted above.  With respect to the annual effective tax rate 
calculation for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a significant portion of our income tax expense was generated in countries in which 
income taxes are imposed on gross revenues, with the most significant of these countries being Angola.  Conversely, the countries in 
which we incurred the most significant income taxes during this period that were based on income before income tax include Norway, 
Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.
Our  rig  operating  structures  further  complicate  our  tax  calculations,  especially  in  instances  where  we  have  more  than 
one operating  structure  for  the  particular  taxing  jurisdiction  and,  thus,  more  than  one method  of  calculating  taxes  depending  on  the 
operating structure utilized by the rig under the contract.  For example, two rigs operating in the same country could generate significantly 
different provisions for income taxes if they are owned by two different subsidiaries that are subject to differing tax laws and regulations in 
the respective country of incorporation.

Operating  revenues—Contract  drilling  revenues  decreased  for  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016  compared  to  the 
six months  ended  June 30,  2015  primarily  due  to  the  following:  (a) approximately  $1.27 billion  of  decreased  revenues  resulting  from 
additional rigs idle or stacked, (b) approximately $390 million of decreased revenues resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale 
and  (c) approximately  $140 million  of  decreased  revenues  resulting  from  lower  dayrates.    These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by 
approximately $85 million of increased revenues associated with our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the 
six months ended June 30, 2016 and approximately $30 million of increased revenues from fewer shipyard and mobilization days for the 
active fleet.
Other revenues increased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily 
due to approximately $151 million of increased revenues resulting from drilling contracts early terminated or cancelled by our customers, 
partially offset by approximately $46 million of decreased revenues for reimbursable items.
Costs and expenses—Excluding the effect of $788 million resulting from cost reimbursements from settlements, recoveries 
from insurance and net adjustments to contingent liabilities associated with the Macondo well incident in 2015, operating and maintenance 
costs and expenses decreased for the six  ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 by approximately 
$900 million.    These  decreases  were  primarily  due  to  the  following:  (a) approximately  $520 million  of  decreased  costs  and  expenses 
resulting from cost reductions for our idle or stacked rigs, (b) approximately $200 million of decreased costs and expenses resulting from 
rigs  sold  or  classified  as  held  for  sale,  (c) approximately  $180 million  of  decreased  costs  and  expenses  for  our  active  fleet  primarily 
resulting from fewer shipyard, mobilization and reduced personnel costs and (d) approximately $70 million of onshore cost reductions.  
These decreases were partially offset by (a) approximately $35 million of increased costs and expenses resulting from the reactivation of 
one harsh  environment  floater  and  (b) approximately  $30 million  of  increased  cost  and  expenses  associated  with  our  newbuild  ultra-
deepwater drillships that commenced operations in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Depreciation expense decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015 
primarily due to the following: (a) approximately $85 million of decreased depreciation resulting from the impairment of our deepwater 
floater  and  midwater  floater  asset  groups  in  the  year  ended  December 31,  2015  and  (b) approximately  $40 million  of  decreased
- 28 -
depreciation resulting from rigs sold or classified as held for sale.  These decreases were partially offset by approximately $31 million of 
increased depreciation associated with our two newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships and other property and equipment placed into service 
subsequent to June 30, 2015.
Impairments—In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a loss of $23 million associated with the impairment of 
certain assets classified as held for sale.  In the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a loss of $507 million associated with the 
impairment of our deepwater floater asset group, a loss of $668 million associated with the impairment of our midwater floater asset group 
and an aggregate loss of $651 million associated with the impairment of certain assets classified as held for sale.
Other income and expense—Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016 
compared  to  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2015,  primarily  due  to  the  following:  (a) approximately  $34 million  of  increased  interest 
capitalized as a result of our newbuild construction program and (b) approximately $43 million of decreased interest expense as a result of 
our  debt  repurchases  and  redemptions,  partially  offset  by  (c) approximately  $15 million  of  increased  interest  expense  as  a  result  of 
downgrades to the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt.
Other  income,  net,  decreased  in  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016  compared  to  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2015, 
primarily due to income of $34 million recognized in the prior-year period associated with license fees and royalties for our dual-activity 
patent with no comparable gains in the current-year period.
Income tax expense—We operate internationally and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in the countries 
in which we operate and earn income.  In the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, 
was 21.5 percent and 21.6 percent, respectively, based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense, after excluding 
certain items, such as losses on impairment and gains and losses on certain asset disposals.  The tax effect, if any, of the excluded items 
as well as settlements of prior year tax liabilities and changes in prior year tax estimates are all treated as discrete period tax expenses or 
benefits.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the effect of the various discrete period tax items was a net tax expense of 
$4 million and less than $1 million, respectively.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, these discrete tax items, coupled with 
the excluded income and expense items noted above, resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.0 percent and 4,100.0 percent, respectively, 
based on income from continuing operations before income tax expense.
For  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016,  to  calculate  our  estimated  effective  income  tax  rate,  excluding  discrete  items,  of 
21.5 percent in accordance with accounting standards for the provision of income taxes, we excluded certain operating losses in taxable 
jurisdictions for which we do not expect to realize a tax benefit.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our estimated effective income 
tax rate, excluding discrete items, would have been 23.0 percent if we had included all jurisdictions in our calculations.
The  relationship  between  our  provision  for  or  benefit  from  income  taxes  and  our  income  before  income  taxes  can  vary 
significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) the overall level of income before income taxes, (b) changes in the 
blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues versus income before taxes, (c) rig movements between taxing jurisdictions and 
(d) our rig operating structures.  Generally, our annual marginal tax rate is lower than our annual effective tax rate.  Consequently, our 
income tax expense does not change proportionally with our income before income taxes.  Significant decreases in our income before 
income  taxes  typically  lead  to  higher  effective  tax  rates,  while  significant  increases  in  income  before  income  taxes  can  lead  to  lower 
effective tax rates, subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense noted above.  With respect to the annual effective tax rate 
calculation for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a significant portion of our income tax expense was generated in countries in which 
income taxes are imposed on gross revenues, with the most significant of these countries being Angola.  Conversely, the countries in 
which we incurred the most significant income taxes during this period that were based on income before income tax include Norway, 
Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.
Our  rig  operating  structures  further  complicate  our  tax  calculations,  especially  in  instances  where  we  have  more  than 
one operating  structure  for  the  particular  taxing  jurisdiction  and,  thus,  more  than  one method  of  calculating  taxes  depending  on  the 
operating structure utilized by the rig under the contract.  For example, two rigs operating in the same country could generate significantly 
different provisions for income taxes if they are owned by two different subsidiaries that are subject to differing tax laws and regulations in 
the respective country of incorporation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Sources and uses of cash
At June 30, 2016, we had $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  In the six months ended June 30, 2016, our primary sources 
of  cash  were  our  cash  flows  from  operating  activities,  including  cash  proceeds  from  customers  that  executed  early  terminations  or 
cancellations of drilling contracts; and net proceeds from restricted cash investments.  Our primary uses of cash were capital expenditures, 
primarily  associated  with  our  newbuild  construction  projects,  debt  repurchases  and  payment  of  scheduled  installments  for  our 
Macondo well incident settlement obligations.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to cash used to pay our shareholders installments of distributions of 
qualifying additional paid-in capital in the prior-year period with no comparable cash flows in the current-year period.  Partially offsetting the 
decrease was an increase in cash used to repay debt.

Drilling fleet
Expansion—From time to time, we review possible acquisitions of businesses and drilling rigs and may make significant future 
capital commitments for such purposes.  We may also consider investments related to major rig upgrades, new rig construction, or the 
acquisition of a rig under construction.  We may commit to such investment without first obtaining customer contracts.  Any acquisition, 
upgrade or new rig construction could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash or the issuance of a substantial number 
of additional shares or other securities.  Our failure to secure drilling contracts for rigs under construction could have an adverse effect on 
our results of operations or cash flows.

(a)  The  ultra-deepwater  floaters  Deepwater Thalassa  and  Deepwater Proteus  were  placed  into  service  and  commenced  operations  in  February 2016  and  May 2016,
respectively.  In the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016, we expect to take delivery of additional equipment, ordered but not yet received.
(b)  Deepwater Conqueror,  a  newbuild  ultra-deepwater  drillship  under  construction  at  the  Daewoo  Shipbuilding  &  Marine  Engineering Co. Ltd.  shipyard  in  Korea,  is
expected to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2016.
(c)  Deepwater Pontus and Deepwater Poseidon, two newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships under construction at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. Ltd.
shipyard in Korea, are expected to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, respectively.
(d)  Transocean Cassiopeia,  Transocean Centaurus,  Transocean Cepheus,  Transocean Cetus  and  Transocean Circinus,  five Keppel  FELS  Super B  400 Bigfoot  class 
design  newbuild  high-specification  jackups  under  construction  at  Keppel FELS’  shipyard  in  Singapore  do  not  yet  have  drilling  contracts  and  are  expected  to  be 
delivered in the first quarter of 2020, the second quarter of 2020, the third quarter of 2020, the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively.  The 
delivery expectations and the cost projections presented above reflect the terms of our construction agreements, as amended to delay delivery in consideration of 
current market conditions.
(e)  Our two unnamed dynamically positioned ultra-deepwater drillships under construction at the Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd. in Singapore do not yet have drilling contracts 
and are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2020, respectively.  The delivery expectations and the cost projections presented 
above reflect the terms of our construction agreements, as amended to delay delivery in consideration of current market conditions.
The  ultimate  amount  of  our  capital  expenditures  is  partly  dependent  upon  financial  market  conditions,  the  actual  level  of 
operational  and  contracting  activity,  the  costs  associated  with  the  current  regulatory  environment  and  customer  requested  capital 
improvements and equipment for which the customer agrees to reimburse us.  As with any major shipyard project that takes place over an 
extended period of time, the actual costs, the timing of expenditures and the project completion date may vary from estimates based on 
numerous factors, including actual contract terms, weather, exchange rates, shipyard labor conditions, availability of suppliers to recertify 
equipment and the market demand for components and resources required for drilling unit construction.  We intend to fund the cash 
requirements relating to our capital expenditures through available cash balances, cash generated from operations and asset sales.  We 
also have available credit under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, as described below, and may utilize other commercial bank or 
capital market financings.  Economic conditions could impact the availability of these sources of funding.
Dispositions—From time to time, we may also review the possible disposition of non-strategic drilling units.  Considering recent 
market conditions, we have committed to plans to sell certain lower-specification drilling units for scrap value.  During the six months ended 
June 30,  2016,  we  identified  two such  drilling  units  that  we  have  sold  or  intend  to  sell  for  scrap  value.    During  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2015, we identified 22 such drilling units that we have sold for scrap value.  We continue to evaluate the drilling units in our 
fleet and may identify additional lower specification drilling units to be sold for scrap value.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we completed the sale of one deepwater floater and five midwater floaters, along 
with related equipment, and we received net cash proceeds of $11 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed the 
sale of two ultra-deepwater floaters, six deepwater floaters and nine midwater floaters, along with related equipment, and we received 
aggregate net cash proceeds of $35 million.
Sources and uses of liquidity
Overview—We expect to use existing cash balances, internally generated cash flows, proceeds from our debt offering, proceeds 
from  the  disposal  of  assets,  borrowings  under  our  bank  credit  agreement  or  proceeds  from  the  issuance  of  additional  debt  to  fulfill 
anticipated obligations, such as capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities or other payments, such as payments in connection with 
our Tender Offer (see “Debt tender offer”), repayment of debt due within one year, payments of our Macondo well incident settlement 
obligations, working capital and other needs in our operations.  We may also consider establishing additional credit facilities under credit 
agreements.  Subject in each case to then existing market conditions and to our then expected liquidity needs, among other factors, we 
may continue to use a portion of our internally generated cash flows to reduce debt prior to scheduled maturities through debt repurchases, 
either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, or through debt redemptions or tender offers.  From time to time, we may 
also use borrowings under our bank credit agreement to maintain liquidity for short-term cash needs.
Our access to debt and equity markets may be limited due to a variety of events, including, among others, credit rating agency 
downgrades of our debt ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our 
industry.    During  the  year  ended  December 31,  2015,  three credit  rating  agencies  downgraded  their  credit  ratings  of  our  non-credit 
enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt (“Debt Rating”) to Debt Ratings that are below investment grade.  During the six months ended 
June 30, 2016, two of the credit rating agencies further downgraded our Debt Rating.  Such downgrades have caused, and any further 
downgrades may cause, us to experience increased fees under our credit facility and interest rates under agreements governing certain of 
our senior notes and may limit our ability to access debt markets.  Our ability to access such markets may be severely restricted at a time 
when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and 
business conditions.  An economic downturn could have an impact on the lenders participating in our credit facilities or on our customers, 
causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.
Our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business and the market sectors in which we operate.  Should the 
drilling market continue to deteriorate, or should we experience poor results in our operations, cash flow from operations may be reduced.  
We have, however, continued to generate positive cash flow from operating activities over recent years and expect that such cash flow will 
continue to be positive over the next year.
Debt  issuance—On  July 21,  2016,  we  completed  an  offering  of  an  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.25 billion  of  the 
9.00% Senior Notes due  July 15, 2023, and we received aggregate cash proceeds of $1.21 billion, net of  initial purchasers’ fees and 
estimated offering costs payable by us.  We will pay interest on the 9.00% Senior Notes semiannually on January 15 and July 15 each 
year, beginning on January 15, 2017.  The indenture that governs the 9.00% Senior Notes contains covenants that, among other things, 
limit  our  ability  to  incur  certain  liens  on  our  drilling  units  without  equally  and  ratably  securing  the  notes,  engage  in  certain  sale  and 
lease-back transactions covering any of our drilling units, allow our subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt, and consolidate, merge or 
enter into a scheme of arrangement qualifying as an amalgamation.  We intend to use the net proceeds from the debt offering to complete 
a Tender Offer (see “Debt tender offer”) and for general corporate purposes.
Debt  tender  offer—On  August 1,  2016,  we  completed  the  Tender  Offer  to  purchase  for  cash  up  to  $1.0 billion  aggregate 
principal amount of the Tendered Notes.  As a result of the Tender Offer, we received valid tenders from holders of an aggregate principal 
amount of $981 million of the Tendered Notes, and we have made or expect to make an aggregate cash payment of $876 million to settle 
the Tendered Notes.
Debt  repurchases  and  redemptions—In  the  six months  ended  June 30,  2016,  we  repurchased  in  the  open  market  an 
aggregate  principal  amount  of  $228 million  of  our  debt  securities  for  an  aggregate  cash  payment  of  $189 million.    In  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2015, we repurchased in the open market an aggregate principal amount of $503 million of certain of our debt securities for 
an aggregate cash payment of $468 million.  On July 30, 2015, we redeemed the remaining aggregate principal amount of $893 million of 
the 4.95% Senior Notes for an aggregate cash payment of $904 million.
Distributions  of  qualifying  additional  paid-in  capital—In  May 2015,  at  our  annual  general  meeting,  our  shareholders 
approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid-in capital in the form of a U.S. dollar denominated dividend of $0.60 per outstanding 
share, payable in four quarterly installments of $0.15 per outstanding share, subject to certain limitations.  In May 2015, we recognized a 
liability of $218 million for the distribution payable, recorded in other current liabilities, with a corresponding entry to additional paid-in 
capital.  On June 17 and September 23, 2015, we paid the first two installments in the aggregate amount of $109 million to shareholders of 
record  as  of  May 29  and  August 25,  2015.    On  October 29,  2015,  shareholders  at  our  extraordinary  general  meeting  approved  the 
cancellation of the third and fourth installments of the distribution.
In May 2014, at our annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the distribution of qualifying additional paid-in capital in 
the form of a U.S. dollar denominated dividend of $3.00 per outstanding share, payable in four quarterly installments, subject to certain 
limitations.  On March 18, 2015, we paid the final installment in the aggregate amount of $272 million to shareholders of record as of 
February 20, 2015.

Litigation settlements and insurance recoveries—On May 20, 2015, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement with 
BP plc (together with its affiliates, “BP”) to settle various disputes remaining between the parties with respect to the Macondo well incident.  
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we received from BP a cash payment of $125 million in July 2015 to partially reimburse us for 
legal  fees  that  we  incurred.    Additionally,  in  connection  with  the  settlement,  BP  agreed  to  discontinue  its  attempts  to  recover  as  an 
additional  insured  under  our  liability  insurance  program.    As  a  result,  we  submitted  claims  to  our  insurers  and,  in  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2015, we received aggregate cash proceeds of $538 million from insurance for recovery of previously incurred losses.
On May 29, 2015, together with the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee (the “PSC”), we filed a settlement agreement in which we 
agreed to pay a total of $212 million, plus up to $25 million for partial reimbursement of attorneys’ fees, to resolve (1) punitive damages 
claims of private plaintiffs, businesses, and local governments and (2) certain claims that BP had made against us and had assigned to 
private plaintiffs who previously settled economic damages claims against BP.  This PSC settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. 
District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (the “MDL Court”) and acceptance by a minimum number of plaintiffs.  In June 2016 and 
August 2015,  we  made  a  cash  deposit  of  $25 million  and  $212 million,  respectively,  into  an  escrow  account  pending  approval  of  the 
settlement by the MDL Court.  As of July 26, 2016, the balance of our escrow account was $237 million.
Effective October 13, 2015, we finalized a settlement agreement with the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and 
Texas (collectively, the “States”), pursuant to which the States agreed to release all of their claims against us arising from the Macondo 
well incident.  On October 22, 2015, we made an aggregate cash payment of $35 million to the States.
Pursuant  to  a  cooperation  guilty  plea  agreement  by  and  among  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  (“DOJ”)  and  certain  of  our 
affiliates (the “Plea Agreement”), which was accepted by the court on February 14, 2013, we agreed to pay a criminal fine of $100 million 
and to consent to the entry of an order requiring us to pay $150 million to the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation and $150 million to the 
National Academy of Sciences in scheduled installments through February 2017.  In each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 
2015, we made aggregate cash payments of $60 million.  The final installment of $60 million is due on or before February 14, 2017.
Pursuant  to  a  civil  consent decree  by  and  among  the  DOJ  and  certain  of  our  affiliates  (“the  Consent Decree”),  which  was 
approved  by  the  court  on  February 19,  2013,  we  agreed  to  pay  a  civil  penalty  totaling  $1.0 billion,  plus  interest  at  a  fixed  rate  of 
2.15 percent.  In the three months ended March 31, 2015, we paid the final installment of $204 million, including interest.
Revolving credit facility—In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated bank credit agreement, which established a 
$3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, that is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019 (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit 
Facility”).  Among other things, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility includes limitations on creating liens, incurring subsidiary debt, 
transactions with affiliates, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and the sale of substantially all assets.  The Five-Year Revolving Credit 
Facility also includes a covenant imposing a maximum debt to tangible capitalization ratio of 0.6 to 1.0.  At June 30, 2016, our debt to 
tangible capitalization ratio, as defined, was 0.4 to 1.0.  In order to borrow or have letters of credit issued under the Five-Year Revolving 
Credit  Facility,  we  must,  at  the  time  of  the  borrowing  request,  not  be  in  default  under  the  bank  credit  agreements  and  make  certain 
representations and warranties, including with respect to compliance with laws and solvency, to the lenders, but we are not required to 
make any representation to the lenders as to the absence of a material adverse effect.  Repayment of borrowings under the Five-Year 
Revolving Credit Facility is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default.  We are also subject to various covenants 
under the indentures pursuant to which our public debt was issued, including restrictions on creating liens, engaging in sale/leaseback 
transactions and engaging in certain merger, consolidation or reorganization transactions.  A default under our public debt indentures, our 
capital lease contract or any other debt owed to unaffiliated entities that exceeds $125 million could trigger a default under the Five-Year 
Revolving Credit Facility and, if not waived by the lenders, could cause us to lose access to the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility.
We may borrow under the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility at either (1) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate plus a 
margin (the “Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin”), which ranges from 1.125 percent to 2.0 percent based on the Debt Rating, or 
(2) the  base  rate  specified  in  the  credit  agreement  plus  the  Five-Year  Revolving  Credit  Facility  Margin,  less  one percent  per  annum.  
Throughout  the  term  of  the  Five-Year  Revolving  Credit  Facility,  we  pay  a  facility  fee  on  the  daily  unused  amount  of  the  underlying 
commitment which ranges from 0.15 percent to 0.35 percent depending on our Debt Rating.  At July 26, 2016, based on our Debt Rating 
on that date, the Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility Margin was 2.0 percent and the facility fee was 0.35 percent.  At July 26, 2016, we 
had no borrowings outstanding, no letters of credit issued, and $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under the Five-Year Revolving 
Credit Facility.
Noncontrolling interest—In February 2016 and May 2016, Transocean Partners declared and paid an aggregate distribution of 
$50 million,  of  which  $14 million  was  paid  to  the  holders  of  noncontrolling  interest.    In  the  year  ended  December 31,  2015, 
Transocean Partners declared and paid an aggregate distribution of $100 million to its unitholders, of which $29 million was paid to the 
holders of noncontrolling interest.
On  November 4,  2015,  Transocean Partners  announced  that  its  board  of  directors  approved  a  unit  repurchase  program, 
authorizing it to repurchase up to $40 million of its publicly held common units.  Subject to market conditions, Transocean Partners may 
repurchase units from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  It may suspend or discontinue the program at 
any  time.    The  common  units  repurchased  under  the  program  will  be  cancelled.    As  of  July 26,  2016,  Transocean Partners  had 
repurchased  478,376 of  its  publicly  held  common  units  for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $4 million.    At  July 26,  2016,  we  held  a 
71.3 percent limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners.
- 33 -
Share  repurchase  program—In  May 2009,  at  our  annual  general  meeting,  our  shareholders  approved  and  authorized  our 
board of directors, at its discretion, to repurchase an amount of our shares for cancellation with an aggregate purchase price of up to 
CHF 3.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $3.6 billion.  On February 12, 2010, our board of directors authorized our management to 
implement the share repurchase program.  At December 31, 2015, we held 2.9 million of our shares.  On October 29, 2015, shareholders 
at  our  extraordinary  general  meeting  approved  the  cancellation  of  all  shares  that  have  been  repurchased  to  date  under  our  share 
repurchase  program.    The  shares  repurchased  under  our  share  repurchase  program  were  cancelled  as  of  January 7,  2016  upon 
registration of the cancellation in the commercial register.  In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we did not purchase any shares under 
our share repurchase program.
Based upon our ongoing capital requirements, the price of our shares, regulatory and tax considerations, cash flow generation, 
the amount and duration of our contract backlog, general market conditions, debt ratings considerations and other factors, we may elect to 
retain  cash,  reduce  debt,  make  capital  investments  or  acquisitions  or  otherwise  use  cash  for  general  corporate  purposes,  and 
consequently, we may elect not to repurchase any additional shares under this program.  Decisions regarding the amount, if any, and 
timing of any share repurchases will be made from time to time based upon these factors.  Any repurchased shares under the share 
repurchase program would be held by us for cancellation by the shareholders at a future general meeting of shareholders.  At July 26, 
2016, the authorization remaining under the share repurchase program was for the repurchase of up to CHF 3.2 billion, equivalent to 
approximately $3.3 billion, of our outstanding shares.
Contractual  obligations—As  of  June 30,  2016,  there  have  been  no  material  changes  to  the  contractual  obligations  as 
previously disclosed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual 
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Other commercial commitments—As of June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the commercial commitments 
as previously disclosed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual 
report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Contingencies and Uncertainties 
Macondo well incident
On April 22, 2010, the ultra-deepwater floater Deepwater Horizon sank after a blowout of the Macondo well caused a fire and 
explosion  on  the  rig  off  the  coast  of  Louisiana.    At  the  time  of  the  explosion,  Deepwater Horizon  was  contracted  to  BP.    Litigation 
commenced shortly after the incident, and most claims against us were consolidated by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation 
and transferred to the MDL Court.  A significant portion of the contingencies arising from the Macondo well incident has now been resolved 
as a result of settlements with the DOJ, BP, the PSC and the States.  We believe the remaining most notable claims against us arising 
from the Macondo well incident  are the potential settlement class opt-outs from the PSC Settlement Agreement.  We can provide no 
assurance as to the outcome of the remaining claims arising from the Macondo well incident, the timing of any upcoming appeal or further 
rulings, or that we will not enter into additional settlements as to some or all of the remaining matters related to the Macondo well incident.  
See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 11—Contingencies.
Tax matters
We conduct operations through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Each country has its own 
tax regimes with varying nominal rates, deductions and tax attributes.  From time to time, we may identify changes to previously evaluated 
tax  positions  that  could  result  in  adjustments  to  our  recorded  assets  and  liabilities.    In  March 2016,  the  U.K.  publicly  announced  its 
2016 Budget  and  Finance  Bill.    These  tax  reform  proposals  include  measures  that  would  deny  tax  deductions  or  require  inclusion  of 
taxable income for certain cross-border structure arrangements and transactions and are expected to be declared effective January 1, 
2017.  The U.K. continues to modify the initial proposals.  Although the final legislation could result in a higher effective tax rate and an 
associated increase in tax costs due to our controlling interest in Transocean Partners, we do not believe that the proposals, as currently 
drafted, would result in an increase in our tax costs.  We continue to monitor developments for potential applicability to our structure.
We file federal and local tax returns in several jurisdictions throughout the world.  Tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are 
examining our tax returns and in some cases have issued assessments.  We are defending our tax positions in those jurisdictions.  We are 
also defending against tax-related claims in courts, including our ongoing civil trial in Norway.
While we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final outcome of these proceedings, we do not expect the ultimate liability 
to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations, although it may have a 
material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows.

Regulatory matters
For a description of regulatory and environmental matters relating to the Macondo well incident, please see “—Macondo well
incident.”
- 34 -
Other matters
In addition, from time to time, we receive inquiries from governmental regulatory agencies regarding our operations around the 
world, including inquiries with respect to various tax, environmental, regulatory and compliance matters.  To the extent appropriate under 
the circumstances, we investigate such matters, respond to such inquiries and cooperate with the regulatory agencies.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated 
financial statements.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with disclosures included in the notes to our condensed consolidated 
financial statements related to estimates, contingencies and other accounting policies.  Significant accounting policies are discussed in 
Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in Note 2 to our consolidated financial 
statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
To prepare financial statements, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities,  revenues,  expenses  and  related  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities.    On  an  ongoing  basis,  we  evaluate  our 
estimates, including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts, materials and supplies obsolescence, investments, property and 
equipment, income taxes, defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefits, contingent liabilities and share based 
compensation.  These estimates require significant judgments and assumptions.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on 
various  other  assumptions  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making 
judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
For a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use in the preparation of our condensed consolidated 
financial  statements,  see  “Item 7.  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations—Critical 
Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  We have discussed the 
development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.  
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the types of judgments, assumptions and estimates 
upon which our critical accounting estimates are based.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk, primarily associated with our long-term and short-term 
debt, our restricted cash balances and investments and our international operations.  For a discussion of our interest rate risk and currency 
exchange rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to these previously reported matters during the six months ended 
June 30, 2016.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures—We  carried  out  an  evaluation,  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of 
management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  disclosure  controls  and 
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined  in the  United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”),  Rules 13a-15  and  15d-15,  were  effective  as  of  June 30,  2016  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that 
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (1) accumulated and communicated to our 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
and  (2) recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission’s rules and forms.
Internal control over financial reporting—There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the 
quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting.

PART II. 
Item 1.
OTHER INFORMATION 
Legal Proceedings
We have certain actions, claims and other matters pending as discussed and reported in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies” and “Part II. Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contingencies and Uncertainties—Macondo 
well incident” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  We are also involved in various tax matters as 
described  in  “Part II.  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data—Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements—Note 6—Income 
Taxes” and in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contingencies 
and Uncertainties—Tax matters” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  All such actions, claims, tax 
and other matters are incorporated herein by reference.
As of June 30, 2016, we were also involved in a number of other lawsuits, claims and disputes, which have arisen in the ordinary 
course of our business and for which we do not expect the liability, if any, to have a material adverse effect on our current consolidated 
statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any of the 
matters referred to above or of any such other pending or threatened litigation or legal proceedings.  There can be no assurance that our 
beliefs or expectations as to the outcome or effect of any lawsuit or claim or dispute will prove correct and the eventual outcome of these 
matters could materially differ from management’s current estimates.
In addition to the legal proceedings described above, we may from time to time identify other matters that we monitor through our 
compliance  program  and  in  response  to  events  arising  generally  within  our  industry  and  in  the  markets  where  we  do  business.    For 
example, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we began investigating statements made by a former employee of Petróleo Brasileiro 
S.A. (“Petrobras”) related to the award to us of a drilling services contract in Brazil.  These statements were made in connection with an 
ongoing criminal investigation by the Brazilian authorities into Petrobras and certain other companies and individuals.  We have completed 
our internal investigation, and we have not identified any wrongdoing by any of our employees or agents in connection with our business.  
We have voluntarily met with governmental authorities in the U.S. to discuss the statements made by the former Petrobras employee and 
our  internal  investigation  as  well  as  our  findings.    We  will  continue  to  investigate  these  types  of  allegations  and  cooperate  with 
governmental authorities.  Through the process of monitoring and proactive investigation, we strive to ensure no violation of our policies, 
Code of Integrity or law has, or will, occur; however, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in “Item 1A. Risk
Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Failure to complete, or delays in completing, the merger with Transocean Partners could negatively impact the market price 
of our shares and our financial results.
Completion  of
the  proposed  merger  with  Transocean Partners  LLC,  a  Marshall
liability  company 
(“Transocean Partners”) is subject to various conditions, including, among others, approval by the unitholders of Transocean Partners, the 
absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions, and the truth and accuracy of representations and warranties, including those relating to 
the absence of any material adverse effect.  There is no certainty that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary 
approvals will be obtained.  If these or other conditions are not satisfied or if there is a delay in the satisfaction of such conditions, then we 
may not be able to complete the merger timely or at all, and such failure or delay may have other adverse consequences.  If the merger is 
not completed or is delayed, we will be subject to a number of risks, including:
Islands
limited
 


we will not realize the expected benefits of the combined company; 
the market price of our shares may decline to the extent that their current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will 
be completed; and 
some costs relating to the merger, such as certain financial advisor and legal fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.

The results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on 
global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national 
referendum.  The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least 
two years after the government of the U.K. formally initiates a withdrawal process.  Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant 
uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that 
will apply as the U.K. determines which European Union-derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal.  The referendum 
has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal.  These developments, or 
the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions 
and  the  stability  of  global  financial  markets,  and  may  significantly  reduce  global  market  liquidity  and  restrict  the  ability  of  key  market 
participants to operate in certain financial markets.  Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, 
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

to  statutory  tax  in  satisfaction  of  withholding  taxes  due  upon  the  vesting  of  restricted  shares  granted  to  our  employees  under  our  Long-Term 
Incentive Plan. 
In May 2009, at the annual general meeting of Transocean Ltd., our shareholders approved and authorized our board of directors, at its discretion, to 
repurchase  an  amount  of  our  shares  for  cancellation  with  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  up  to  CHF 3.5 billion,  equivalent  to  approximately 
$3.6 billion.  On February 12, 2010, our board of directors authorized our management to implement the share repurchase program.  Since inception 
of  the  share  repurchase  program,  we  repurchased  2,863,267 of  our  shares  under  the  share  repurchase  program  for  an  aggregate  cost  of 
$240 million, equivalent to an average cost of $83.74 per share, and at December 31, 2015, we held such shares in treasury.  On October 29, 2015, 
shareholders at our extraordinary general meeting approved the cancellation of all shares that have been repurchased to date under our share 
repurchase program.  The cancellation of our shares held in treasury became effective as of January 7, 2016 upon registration of the cancellation in 
the commercial register.  Based upon our ongoing capital requirements, cash flow generation and general market conditions, among other factors, 
we may elect not to repurchase any additional shares under this program.  See “Part I. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Operating Results—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources and uses of liquidity.”
