<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/29, extended the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health as originally set out in resolutions 2002/31 and 2004/27 of the 
Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with his mandate, the Special Rapporteur regularly receives information 
related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health. This information sometimes 
includes credible allegations of serious violations of the right to health. In such cases, the Special 
Rapporteur writes to a Government or other relevant actor, independently or together with other 
special procedures, inviting comments on allegations, seeking clarifications and urging remedial 
action where appropriate.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. This addendum contains summaries of communications, on a country-by-country basis, 
sent by the Special Rapporteur between 2 December 2006 and 1 December 2007 as well as 
responses from Governments received between 2 December 2006 and 21 January 2008. The 
report also reflects two communications that originated prior to 2 December 2006 but for which 
a response from the Government was received after that date and therefore was not included in 
the last year&#8217;s report on communications. 
</p>
<p>4. Most of the communications of the Special Rapporteur have been sent jointly with one or 
more special procedures of the Human Rights Council. During the period under review, the 
Special Rapporteur sent a total of 27 communications to 22 Member States and one 
communication to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The 
Special Rapporteur has received 17 replies from Governments and one from UNMIK. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to those Governments and international organizations 
that have replied to his communications. However, he regrets that some Governments, have 
failed to respond at all, or have responded only partially to the questions arising from the 
communication. Full responses to these communications remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>REPLIES FROM GOVERNMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>6. On 2 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur on torture and Special Rapporteur on the 
right to health brought to the Government&#8217;s attention the situation concerning Sanad Ali Yislam 
Al-Kazimi, Yemeni national, and Fahd Muhammed Abdullah Al-Fawzan, a Saudi national, both 
of whom were, at the time of the communication, detained at the U.S. Naval Base in 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</p>
<p>7. According to the information received Mr. Al-Kazimi was arrested in Dubai, United Arab 
Emirates, in early January 2003 and was detained for eight months and 16 days. While in 
detention in Dubai, it is alleged that he was subjected to spatial and temporal disorientation by 
having his eyes and ears covered and by being held in complete darkness. It was reported that on 
or about 16 to 18 August 2003, he was transferred to the custody of United States forces and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>taken to Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was held for nine months. It is alleged that he was 
physically and psychologically tortured by Jordanian interrogators under the supervision of U.S. 
personnel and he attempted suicide three times by hitting his head into the cell wall. It was 
further reported that on or about 16 May 2004, he was transferred to Bagram, where he was held 
in U.S. custody for four months and tortured. According to the information received on or about 
18 September 2004, he was taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was detained at the time 
of the communication. It is reported that the detainee was suffering from chronic constipation, 
haemorrhoids, and blood in his faeces since his detention. Moreover, it is alleged that he was not 
permitted to see a lawyer, relatives or friends before his transfer to Guantanamo Bay, and also 
that he has not seen any member of his family since his arrest in early 2003. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received Mr. Al-Fawzan was apprehended between October 
and December 2001 by Pakistani tribesmen who turned him over to the Pakistani military. He 
was reportedly interrogated by Pakistani military and shortly afterwards transferred to U.S. 
military custody in Kohat, Pakistan; thereafter he was taken to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where he 
was held for two months. It is alleged that while in detention in Afghanistan, Mr. Al-Fawzan was 
threatened with firearms, strangled with wires and shocked with electricity by unidentified U.S. 
officials. It was further reported that in early 2002, he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
where he was detained at the time of the communication. While in Guantanamo, he allegedly 
suffered severe abuse and torture in the course of interrogations. It was reported that he had not 
seen any member of his family since his departure for Afghanistan in October 2001. 
</p>
<p>9. It was reported that since both Mr. Al-Kazimi and Mr. Al-Fawzan were arrested, they were 
tortured for purposes of intimidation, coercion to extract information and punishment for not 
complying with demands by U.S. personnel. In addition, it is alleged that prisoners in 
Guantanamo routinely refused to ask for medical treatment due to a fear that treatment would be 
withheld or that knowledge of their medical condition by interrogators would be exacerbated 
during interrogations. As a consequence, both detainees refused medical treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> Observation 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of the report, the  
 Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Angola

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 4 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health sent a letter concerning the 
health situation in Xa-Muteba municipality. According to information received, there was a 
complete lack of State-provided maternal health care in the Xa-Muteba municipality. In addition, 
the public health posts in the municipality allegedly did not offer pre- and/or post-natal 
consultations or obstetric services. Maternal health care is reportedly hampered due to limited 
allocation of financial resources. Allegations were also made regarding the lack of healthcare 
facilities within a short distance, the high cost of consultations, untrained and often absent health 
staff due to unpaid salaries, and the unaffordability of private clinics providing services of 
questionable quality. Lack of certain essential medicines required for the health of children in the 
area, which led to a high number of neonatal deaths from tetanus and improper immunization </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/11/Add.1 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>processes, were also reported. Considering that malaria was reported to be the leading cause of 
death in the group under 5 years of age, accounting for 51.6 per cent of deaths, additional claims 
were made with respect to the lack of available effective malaria treatment. The Special 
Rapporteur was concerned that the Global Fund was funding the roll-out of the Artemisin-based 
Combination Therapy (ACT), a first-line treatment for malaria in Angola, whereas Xa-Mutabe 
was not included in the list of prioritized municipalities. It was also alleged that the State had 
failed to ensure access to clean water and adequate sanitation since the end of the war, which had 
led to major outbreaks of epidemic diseases such as Marburg haemorrhagic fever and cholera. 
<b> Observation 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of the report, the  
 Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Australia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning 
Mr. Amer Haddara, Mr. Shane Kent, Mr. Izzydeen Attik, Mr. Fadal Sayadi, Mr. Abdullah Merhi, 
Mr. Ahmed Raad, Mr. Ezzit Raad, Mr. Hany Taha, Mr. Aimen Joud, Mr. Shoue Hammoud, 
Mr. Majed Raad, Mr Bassam Raad and Mr Abdul Nacer Benbrika (collectively &#8220;the detainees&#8221;), 
who were being held on remand as non-convicted prisoners in the maximum security Acacia 
Unit of Barwon Prison in Victoria. According to the information received, the detainees were 
subjected to periods of extended solitary confinement, had extremely limited and restrictive 
visitation rights, and were allowed outside of their cells for a very limited time each day. 
Reportedly, there was an overall lack of access to adequate health care and particularly mental 
health care in Victorian prisons. It was also reported that the conditions of confinement had a 
deleterious effect on the mental health of some of the detainees. Further, the Senate Select 
Committee on Mental Health accepted in its 2006 report that the provision of health care for 
forensic patients and mentally ill prisoners in all Australian jurisdictions was inadequate, 
including in Victoria. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>12. By letter dated 22 February 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 8 December 2006 and stated, inter alia, that the alleged offenders had never been held in 
solitary confinement; rather, each prisoner had an individual cell. Remand prisoners were 
permitted one non-contact visit per week of one hour duration and one contact visit per month 
with any children they had under the age of 16 years. It was further confirmed that all prisoners, 
upon entering the prison, are medically assessed, including a psychiatric assessment, and, if 
needed, are provided with adequate treatment. As the Government was finalizing its response to 
the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health report, it could not comment on it in this 
response.

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>13. By letter dated 5 January 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 12 October 2006 (A/HRC/4/28/Add.1, paragraph 9). In this communication the Special 
Rapporteur expressed concern regarding the access to health care of individuals holding a 
Bridging Visa E (BVE), as well as the enjoyment of the right to health of asylum seekers in 
detention centers in Australia. In its response, the Government stated that most of the people 
holding a BVE are those who have been found not to meet Australia&#8217;s protection obligations. 
The Government also informed that access to Australia&#8217;s universal healthcare system, Medicare, 
which provides subsidized or free charge care, is granted only to holders of BVE, but emergency 
medical treatment is available to all persons including holders of BVE or any other temporary 
visa. Regarding financial assistance, the Government stated that Asylum Seeker Assistance 
(ASA) is available to protection visa applicants who are unable to meet their basic needs for 
food, accommodation and health care. The ASA provides financial assistance to asylum seekers 
who have been awaiting a primary decision on their protection visa application for six months or 
more, although there are generous exemptions to this criterion to ensure the most vulnerable are 
supported. Therefore, asylum seekers who hold BVEs and are eligible for the ASA may receive 
financial assistance for health services. The Government recognized that some people may 
experience mental health concerns while in immigration detention and confirmed that additional 
funding has been allocated to ensure that mental health care of people in detention is addressed. 
The Government also confirmed that all detention facilities in Australia have safe and potable 
water and sewage systems in place. The Department for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
has recently completed a review of the Bridging Visa system in order to establish a system which 
is clearer and more consistent and, at the same time, sufficiently flexible to respond to individual 
circumstances.

<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>14. On 13 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on right to health sent an urgent appeal regarding Ms. Sigma Huda, a lawyer, head of 
the human rights group Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights, and the 
United Nations Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children. 
According to the information received, since 5 July 2007 she has been detained in custody in 
connection with a case of alleged extortion. Reportedly she had potentially life-threatening heart 
and kidney conditions and is not getting adequate treatment in prison. It was reported that 
according to a senior consultant in cardiology, she was suffering from coronary heart disease, 
diabetes mellitus and a chronic renal (kidney) failure. According to the information received 
Sigma Huda was under treatment and observation when she was taken into custody. Allegedly 
she was taken to court in an ambulance, and to the courtroom on a stretcher, to hear the charges 
against her. She was then sent to back to jail. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>15. By letter dated 24 July 2007, the Government replied that the Anti-Corruption Commission 
had filed formal complaints against Ms. Huda and her husband and detailed the charges. The 
Government reiterated that it was adhering to strict legal principles in dealing with her case. 
She was being represented by two of the most prominent attorneys in Bangladesh. According 
to the letter received the Government had noted concerns expressed on the health condition of 
Ms. Huda. According to the latest information received from the concerned authorities, 
Ms. Huda appeared to be in good health, having recovered from her earlier ailment. It is also 
reported that Ms. Huda was receiving the necessary medical care, including the assistance from 
doctors of her choice. 
</p>
<p>16. By letter dated 16 August 2007, the Government informed that Ms. Huda was being 
provided with proper and timely medical treatment as and when required, under the exiting Jail 
Code of Bangladesh. She was also receiving specialized medical care. As desired by her, a 
renowned cardiac specialist of BSM Medical University, the country&#8217;s most reputed Medical 
Hospital, attended her on 14 July 2007. She was also sent to this specialized hospital recently to 
obtain medical advice. On 6 August 2007, she was again referred to this hospital. Subsequently, 
as per advice of the doctors, she was admitted to the same hospital, where she was then in receipt 
of necessary medical care. A copy of a medical certificate was provided by the Government.

<p>17. On 18 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to education, sent a joint letter regarding Fabrice Nimubona, a fifteen year old boy who 
was being detained at Prince Regent Charles Hospital in Bujumbura. According to the 
information received, Fabrice Nimbuona was admitted to the hospital after being injured in 
July 2004 and where he spent a year undergoing surgery and treatment until he was declared 
well enough to be discharged in July 2005. However, it was alleged that he had been detained 
because his mother had not been able to pay the hospital charges, which, according to an 
estimate made in October 2006, amounted to 3.050.065 FBU or US$ 2,891. According to the 
report, Fabrice Nimbuona had missed more than a year of school as a consequence of his 
detention in the hospital since July 2005.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 1 February 2007, mandates of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health and the Special Rapporteur on torture sent an urgent appeal 
regarding three men, Mohammad Mahjoub, Mahmoud Jaballah and Hassan Almrei in 
immigration detention on so-called &#8220;security certificates.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>19. According to the information received Mohammad Mahjoub, a citizen of Egypt was 
accepted as a convention refugee in Canada in 1996. It was reported that Mohammad Mahjoub 
was arrested in Toronto in June 2000 under a security certificate. His certificate was upheld in 
October 2001 and he was denied bail in November 2003 and again in November 2005. 
Furthermore, according to the information received Mahmoud Jaballah, also an Egyptian citizen 
was arrested under a security certificate in August 2001, days before the hearing on his asylum 
claim. Reportedly he had previously been detained under a security certificate for seven months 
in 1999 before a judge declared the certificate null and void. The second certificate was also 
declared null and void by a judge as well, but, a third certificate having been issued, he was not 
released. It was also reported that Hassan Almrei, from Syria, was accepted by Canada as 
convention refugee in June 2000. Allegedly he was arrested under a security certificate in 
October 2001 and his certificate was upheld by a judge the same year. He has been refused bail 
twice. While <i>de jure</i> in immigration detention, the three men had spent most of the more than 
five years (in the case of Mr. Mahjoub, more than six-and-a-half) of their detention in a 
provincial (criminal) high-security prison, several of those years in solitary confinement. 
According to the reports, Mohammad Mahjoub, Mahmoud Jaballah and Hassan Almrei were, at 
the time of the communication, detained at the Kingston Immigration Holding Centre, where the 
three men were on a liquids-only hunger strike. As of the 30 January 2007, Mohammad Mahjoub 
had been on hunger strike for 67 days, while Mahmoud Jaballah and Hassan Almrei had been on 
hunger strike for 56 days. According to the information received, the authorities in charge of the 
Kingston Immigration Holding Centre were not medically monitoring the vital signs (i.e., blood 
pressure, cardiac and respiratory rates) nor the general health status of the three detainees. 
Moreover, Mohammad Mahjoub had reportedly not received treatment for his hepatitis C since 
September 2006. In addition, Mr. Mahjoub and Mr. Jaballah were, according to the information 
received, particularly vulnerable to a variety of health difficulties because they had been tortured 
in their country of origin. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>20. In the response dated 2 March 2007, the Government of Canada informed that the 
detainees were being housed at the Kingston Immigration Holding Centre (KIHC), which opened 
in 2006 for the purpose of housing persons who were subject to security certificates and, 
although within the confines of the federal penal institution of Millhaven Penitentiary at Bath, it 
was operated by the Canada Border Services Agency, the governmental agency responsible for 
enforcing Canada&#8217;s immigration laws. Access to essential medical, mental and dental care is 
provided to detainees. A nurse visits daily KIHC and is able to monitor the vital signs of the 
detainees if they consent. Licensed physicians are also available to provide examinations and 
treatment. With respect to the potential mental health problems that may arise out of their </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/11/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>confinement, Canada reiterated that the detainees had psychological and medical care available, 
should they choose to access it. Canada was aware of the risks to the mental health of the 
detainees but considered that a certain amount of psychological stress is an inevitable 
consequence of the fact of detention. Nevertheless, it is committed to minimizing the potential 
impact of their confinement on the detainees. Some of the measures implemented in that regard 
include the availability of daily family visits and telephone use; spiritual and religious services; 
availability of special or religious diets on request; daily outdoor activity in the exercise yard; 
daily access to an indoor gym; shared library material; a common room where table games may 
be played; personal televisions; and medical care.

</b></p>
<p>21. On 10 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent an 
urgent appeal regarding restrictions on events and human rights defenders promoting human 
rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, as well as the treatment for haemophiliacs infected with HIV 
through blood products. According to information received, the Shanghai authorities arrested 
three haemophiliacs, Mr. Zhao Chenyang, Mr. Wang Xinyang and Mr. Yang Shoufu in front of a 
hospital in Shanghai on 24 October 2006 and Mr. Kong Delin, the leader of the Chinese 
Haemophilia Association, on the following day. Each of these individuals had been raising issues 
regarding the protection of the human rights of haemophiliacs. Though Kong Delin was released 
on 30 November 2006, it was reported, the others were kept in detention without any update on 
their condition and whereabouts. Furthermore, it was reported that on 24 November 2006, 
Dr. Wan Yanhai, founding member and director of the Beijing ZHIAIXING Information and 
Counseling Centre (commonly known as the AIZHIXING Institute), an organization which 
promotes and defends the rights of individuals living with HIV/AIDS, was instructed by the 
police to cancel the workshop on &#8220;Blood Safety, AIDS, Law and Human Rights&#8221;, scheduled 
for 25 November 2006. He was then reportedly taken into police custody in an undisclosed 
location and remained therein for more than 48 hours without being charged, in breach of both 
the PRC Public Order Management Punishment Law and the Regulations on Procedures of 
Processing Administrative Detention by Public Security Authorities. He was released on 
27 November 2006. It was also reported that Dr Wan had been threatened on previous occasions 
in relation to his work on HIV/AIDS and health rights. He was reportedly detained for one 
month in August 2002 on suspicion of &#8220;illegally leaking state secrets&#8221; for electronic distribution 
to the organization&#8217;s mailing list of a government document regarding the issue of HIV/AIDS 
epidemic in Henan Province. The AIZHIXING Institute was allegedly prevented from 
registering as a non-profit non-governmental organization and was required to register as a for-
profit business. The information received also alleged that at that time there was neither 
satisfactory treatment nor compensation for haemophiliacs infected with HIV/AIDS and 
hepatitis. The free medication and treatment made available to HIV/AIDS patients by the 
Government since 2003 was reportedly not suitable for haemophiliacs. In addition, it is known </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>that haemophiliacs are prone to develop various syndromes such as malformation, impaired 
mobility and bleeding, conditions for which treatment was not made available by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>22. On 9 March 2007, the Government replied and informed that, on 17 August 2002, 
Wan Yanhai unlawfully gained possession of classified government documents and transmitted 
to third parties outside the country. Therefore, on 25 August 2002, Wan Yanhai was legally kept 
in custody for investigative purposes. Following the investigation, Wan Yanhai confessed his 
unlawful actions, voluntarily acknowledged his guilt and rendered positive assistance to the State 
security authorities in tracing other persons who had unlawfully provided secrets to third parties. 
In view of the good attitude shown by Wan Yanhai, the Beijing city public security bureau 
decided to release him on 20 September 2002. The Government stressed that Wan Yanhai was 
not taken into custody because of his work towards the protection of the rights of people infected 
with HIV/AIDS, but because of his violation of the country&#8217;s law. In November 2006, in Beijing, 
Wan Yanhai organized the second symposium on Blood Safety, AIDS, the Law and Human 
Rights. On 24 November, becoming aware of the event, the public security authorities sought 
further information on it from Wan Yanhai, but did not take any coercive measures against him 
or take him into custody in an undisclosed location, as alleged. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding the provision of free medical treatment to HIV-infected haemophilia patients in 
China, it was stressed that AIDS patients living in unfavourable economic conditions were 
entitled to receive antiretroviral treatment and drugs free of charge as well as social assistance. 
With regard to the issue of haemophilia patients infected with HIV through coagulation factor 
infusions, it was informed that the Ministry of Health issued circulars regarding appropriate 
treatment and care programmes for haemophilia patients infected with HIV in which the 
principle of antiretroviral treatment provided free of charge for those living in conditions of 
economic need was reaffirmed. Thus, since 2001, Shanghai city has been providing free medical 
services and welfare benefits for haemophilia patients listed in the city&#8217;s household as infected 
with HIV through coagulation factor infusions. Apart from providing free treatment, the 
Shanghai city government has mounted a range of fundraising activities to provide these patients 
with subsistence allowances. It was also claimed that in Suzhou city, Nantong city, Tongshan 
county, Zhejiang province and Hubei province,<b> </b>haemophilia patients who have become infected 
with HIV as a result of infusions of blood plasma and blood products receive a lump-sum 
compensation payment and a monthly subsistence allowance. It was also mentioned that the 
implementation of these policies<b> </b>in provinces with relatively depressed economic conditions was 
somewhat uneven, and that some haemophilia patients had not received compensation or medical 
and subsistence allowances or were not satisfied with the rates of compensation and the 
allowances paid in their areas. Therefore,<b> </b>in recent years there have been pleas for help, which 
on some occasions have become radical mass protests where some people take advantage to 
perpetrate unlawful criminal activities, for which they are duly punished. Finally, the 
Government said that none of the persons mentioned in the communication, namely, 
Zhao Chenyang, Wang Xinyang, Yang Shoufu and Kong Delin, had been arrested or taken into 
custody.<b> </b></p>

<p>24. On 12 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur on toxic wastes, the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to health and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Mr. Sun Xiaodi, a Gansu-based 
activist who spent more than a decade petitioning the central authorities over radioactive 
contamination from the No. 792 Uranium Mine in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture 
in Gansu Province. It was reported that since 1 December 2006, when Mr. Sun Xiaodi received 
the Nuclear-Free Future Award, he started facing problems like his house being raided at night 
and stones being thrown at his doors and windows. Mr. Sun Xiaodi reported the attacks to the 
local state security officers, who, instead of taking action, told him he was free to leave if 
desired. Moreover, since his brief detention in early 2006, Mr. Sun Xiaodi was reportedly facing 
interruptions in water and electricity supplies for no apparent reasons. Although no longer 
officially under surveillance, in practice all of his movements were allegedly monitored. 
Furthermore, Mr. Sun Xiaodi was unable to obtain official permission to seek medical treatment 
in Beijing for a tumour, a potentially life-threatening health condition. It was also reported that 
residents of the area where he lives were suffering an unusually high rate of cancer and other 
health conditions which might be associated with radioactive contamination. Mr. Sun Xiaodi 
reportedly experienced physical discomfort and, in addition to the tumour, suffered from gall 
stones and coronary heart disease. Concerns were expressed that the absence of response 
regarding Mr. Sun Xiaodi request for further treatment in Beijing may be in retaliation for his 
legitimate activities in the defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>25. By letter dated 26 February 2007, the Government presented clarifications. To begin with, 
it was said that on 29 April 2005 Sun Xiaodi was taken into criminal detention in accordance 
with the law for suspicion of having provided State secrets to third parties outside the country. 
Then, on 4 June 2005, his arrest warrant was approved by the competent authorities and on 
19 September 2005 the measure of restraint implemented against him was amended to residential 
surveillance. He was later released from residential surveillance and by the time of the reply no 
public security authorities were applying restraint measures against him. In respect to the 
treatment and disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear plant 792, the Government reported 
that the mentioned plant stopped operating in 1994 and was definitively closed in 2002, when the 
Gansu Longjiang Nuclear Company Ltd. was set up in its place with the specific responsibility 
for decommissioning and treatment projects as well as for the recovery of disused ore. In 
addition, according to relevant State model regulations and design criteria, plant 792 carried out 
sorting, treatment and disposal procedures for its polluting equipment and installations, while the 
waste rock and tailings from uranium mining activities and hydro-metallurgical processing only 
contain the low-level radioactive materials found in naturally occurring radioactive nuclides. The 
decommissioning and treatment work for the closure of the mine was supposed to be completed 
by 2007 in order to gradually restore the area&#8217;s natural environmental system. </p>

<p>26. On 19 June 2007, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group on arbitrary detention, 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Peng Ming, who was at the 
time detained at Han Yang Prison No. 16 in Wu Han City, Hu Bei province. His case was the 
subject matter of Opinion no. 43/2005 of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, adopted on 
29 November 2005, in which the Working Group found that &#8220;any limitation of Mr. Peng Ming&#8217;s 
legitimate political and non-violent activities carried out peacefully and in exercise of his rights 
to freedom of association and expression would be contrary to the international human rights law 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8221; and concluded that Mr. Peng Ming&#8217;s 
detention from 28 May 2004 onwards, was &#8220;arbitrary, being in contravention of articles 19 and 
20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#8221;. According to the information received, 
Mr. Peng Ming, who was still detained at the time of the communication in spite of the Working 
Group&#8217;s Opinion, suffered from serious health problems - including kidney stones, infections, 
swelling and open wounds on arms and legs - whereas the prison authorities were denying him 
adequate medical care. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>27. By letter dated 31 July 2007, the Government replied. It was reported that Peng Ming 
was arrested on 17 June 2004 on suspicion of kidnapping and on 23 June 2004 he was put in 
custody. On 20 July 2005, proceedings were instituted against him by the Wuhan city people&#8217;s 
procurator for the offences of setting up and directing a terrorist organization, kidnapping and 
possessing counterfeit currency. On 13 October 2005, the Wuhan city people&#8217;s intermediate 
court, passing judgment at first instance, sentenced Peng Ming to life imprisonment for the 
offence of setting up and directing a terrorist organization and deprived him of his political 
rights in perpetuity; for the offence of kidnapping, he was sentenced to 13 years fixed-term 
imprisonment, deprivation of political rights for two years, and payment of a fine of 
20,000 yuan; for the offence of possession of counterfeit currency, the court sentenced him to 
six years fixed-term imprisonment and to the payment of a fine of 15,000 yuan. The court ruled 
that the final consolidated sentence should be life imprisonment, with the deprivation of his 
political rights in perpetuity, and the payment of a fine of 35,000 yuan. It was also reported that 
refusing to accept the court&#8217;s verdict at first instance, Peng Ming lodged an appeal. The Hubei 
provincial people&#8217;s high court, after hearing the case at second instance, found that the 
determination of the offences by the court of first instance had been based on clearly established 
facts, the evidence had been sound and ample, the classification of the offences had been 
accurate, the sentence was commensurate with the offences and the trial proceedings had 
followed due process. Accordingly, on 15 December 2005, the court reached its ruling at 
second instance and, on 23 December, made public its judgment in which Peng Ming&#8217;s 
appeal was dismissed and the original judgment should stand. Upon entering prison, the results 
of Peng Ming&#8217;s physical examination showed that he was suffering from high blood pressure, 
kidney stones in his right kidney and hepatitis. Following medication and treatment over the </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/11/Add.1

</p>
<p>course of nearly one year, his state of health improved demonstrably so that in December 2006 
the results of his medical examination were normal, apart from a slight kidney stone problem. He 
then continued receiving treatment as before. The Government finally affirmed that the 
allegations in the communication that Peng Ming suffered from serious health problems and that 
the prison authorities were denying him adequate medical care were completely groundless.

Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, Iranian citizen, aged 49, who has already been the subject of a 
joint urgent appeal dated 20 December 2006. 
</p><p>31. According to the new information received, Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s trial was held 
on 10 June 2007 before the Special Court for the Clergy and he was denied legal counsel. It 
remained unclear whether he was sentenced to death or whether his case was still under 
consideration. Allegedly, the trial was related to Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s religious views, since he 
supported freedom of religion and the separation between religion and politics. At the time of the 
communication, Mr. Boroujerdi was detained in Evin prison, where in addition to the severe 
conditions of detention, he was allegedly beaten and had cold water spilled on him while 
sleeping. He is also suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart

</p>
<p>since 9 June 2007 Palestinians had been unable to leave the Gaza Strip. As a consequence, 
patients with severe health conditions were unable to leave the Gaza Strip. Hospitals in Gaza 
lacked the specialized personnel and equipment required to treat a range of conditions such as 
cancer, cardio-vascular diseases, complex surgeries and other emergencies. Reportedly, prior to 
the ban on the Rafah Crossing, every month several hundreds of Palestinian inhabitants of the 
Gaza Strip used to receive medical treatment or undergo surgery in Egyptian hospitals/medical 
facilities, and some of them were sent to other countries subject to them receiving security 
clearance. Since 9 June, only the most urgent medical cases had been allowed by the Israeli 
authorities to leave the Gaza Strip to go to hospitals in Israel. Some patients reportedly died 
because of the late Israeli permission or the refusal from authorities in the basis of &#8220;security

the communication, in preliminary detention at Riga Central prison since December 2006. 
Mr. Grilyanov was allegedly suffering from severe spinal atrophy and was officially recognized 
as &#8220;1st group invalid&#8221;. In spite of his illness, he was reportedly not receiving any special 
assistance in the prison - guards and other members of staff were not regularly coming to his 
cell, therefore depriving him from receiving food and water with regularity. Mr Grilyanov was 
also not receiving medical treatment or any medication for his condition, which caused the 
atrophy to progress rapidly together with severe pain. Moreover, it was alleged that he filed 
complaints with the prison administration, prison doctors and the prosecutor's office but did not 
receive any replies.

concerning the United States - Malaysia Free Trade Agreement that was under negotiation. 
According to the information received, the Agreement could extend patent protections in 
Malaysia in a way that would not make use of the flexibilities contained in the TRIPS 
Agreement and further elaborated in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public 
Health. It was also alleged that provisions in the Agreement could conflict with the ability of the 
Malaysian Government to implement tobacco control measures. It was noted that access to 
medication in the context of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is a 
fundamental element for achieving progressively the full realization of the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health, as recognized in many international treaties. The Special 
Rapporteur also drew the attention of the Government to the Framework Convention on Tobacco

<p>46. On 23 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health sent a letter to the 
Government of Philippines concerning the House Bill (HB) 6035 - An Act Providing for 
Cheaper Medicines and for other Purposes, - which includes legislative proposals intended to 
amend the Philippines Patents Act, RA 8293. According to information received, HB 6035 was 
not making full use of the flexibilities contained in the TRIPS Agreement and further elaborated 
in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Thus, the proposals could 
jeopardize the enjoyment of the right to health. Moreover, some of the proposals in HB 6035 
were unclear with regard to compulsory licensing. For instance, HB 6035 did not provide for 
compulsory licensing in the event of such medicines being made available to the public in 
insufficient quantity or quality or at an abnormally high price. Such a provision is or may be 
necessary to provide access to essential medicines, especially for medicines for certain rare 
diseases. Similarly, the proposal did not deal with the granting of compulsory licenses for 
importation. Under the TRIPS Agreement, compulsory licenses may legitimately be granted for 
the importation, as well as manufacture, of a protected product. Importation is crucial for 
developing countries with limited technological capabilities to undertake manufacturing of the 
protected product and to address emergency or anti-competitive situations in which rapid action 
is necessary.

not approved during the 13th Session of the Philippine Congress and provided some information 
from the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines regarding the points raised by the 
Special Rapporteur. </p>

<p>48. On 8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the 
adoption and implementation of an Executive Order (no. 0003 of series 2000) in Manila, which 
aimed to discourage the use of modern methods of contraception, including condoms, pills, 
intrauterine devices and surgical sterilization. According to the information received, this policy 
obstructed access to reproductive health information and modern methods of contraception. 
Furthermore, drug stores and other entities that sold contraceptives had reportedly found it 
difficult to obtain business licenses. The Women&#8217;s Health Care Foundation, a non-profit 
organization that provides emergency contraceptive services, was reportedly forced to stop its 
operations in the city and move its clinic outside of Manila because of &#8220;harassment&#8221; by the city 
authorities.

on 5 October 2006 by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education (A/HRC/4/28/Add.1, para. 38). In this communication, the Special Rapporteurs 
expressed concern regarding reports alleging discrimination and denial of medical care to 
children and young people living with HIV/AIDS. In its response, the Government stated that a 
National Strategy for Monitoring, Preventing and Controlling cases of HIV/AIDS for 2004-2007 
was adopted to provide measures to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS infection as well as to 
protect those already infected. The strategy was being implemented by an inter-ministerial 
commission that guaranteed a coordinated and transparent approach to the various aspects 
involved with the disease. The Government also indicated that the National Authority for the 
Protection of Children&#8217;s rights was taking actions to reduce discrimination of children living 
with HIV/AIDS. These actions were aimed at increasing tolerance and acceptance of children 
with HIV/AIDS as well as ensuring their right to education. Furthermore, awareness raising 
campaigns were organized to inform the population and to train professionals on the obligation 
to respect children&#8217;s rights and to ensure social reintegration of children living with HIV/AIDS.

<p>50. On 15 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur on the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers concerning a Russian defence lawyer, 
Mr. Mikhail Trepashkin, who was imprisoned at IK 13, an open prison colony located in 
Sverdlovsk Region. Although his situation was already the subject matter of past urgent appeals, 
the information received indicated that Mr. Trepashkin was still being denied access to adequate 
medical treatment for chronic, life-threatening asthma. Mr. Trepashkin had been preliminarily 
diagnosed with a level of asthma which, under Russian law, qualified him for transfer to a 
hospital for medical treatment and consideration of early release. According to the information 
received the head of the prison continued to object to such a transfer despite repeated statements 
by the head of the prison&#8217;s health department that the prison&#8217;s medical staff were unable to treat 
Mr. Trepashkin adequately. It was also alleged that prison authorities denied his lawyers the 
results of the medical examinations carried out in May and October 2006, thereby precluding any 
legal contest of the refusal to transfer. Further, it was alleged that Mr. Trepashkin had repeatedly 
been placed in a punishment cell, apparently in connection with his demands for medical 
treatment in compliance with the law. The dire hygienic conditions in those cells, which were 
neither heated nor ventilated irrespective of temperature, further contributed to the deteriorating 
status of Mr. Trepashkin&#8217;s health. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>51. By letter dated 28 December 2006, the Government of Russia responded to the joint 
communication and indicated that Mr. Trepashkin was under clinical observation at the 
medical section of the prison and repeatedly examined by specialists in April, May, June and 
October 2006. He was receiving recommended treatments. According to the Government, the 
claim that the head of prison&#8217;s medical unit requested the transfer of Mr. Trepashkin to a hospital 
was untrue. Having breached internal regulations, the prisoner was placed in a punishment cell. 
Before being sent there, medical staff had examined him. During his time in the punishment 
cell, he was examined daily by medical staff and received the treatment recommended. 
On 19 December 2006, Mr. Trepashkin was examined. His state of health was deemed 
satisfactory and he was thus receiving outpatient care.

question of torture sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Omrie Golley, a British born lawyer of 
Sierra Leonean descent, currently at Pademba Road Prison, Freetown, Sierra Leone. According 
to the information received on 12 January 2006, Mr. Golley was arrested in a hotel room in </p>

</p>
<p>Freetown without a warrant and was later charged with treason, which carries the death penalty. 
On 21 January 2006, he was transferred to Pademba Road Prison and since his incarceration his 
health had deteriorated. According to the reports he suffered from a serious heart problem 
resulting in palpitations and daily angina attacks, very high and fluctuating blood pressure 
despite medication, high cholesterol, impaired liver and kidney function, a kidney infection and 
anaemia. It was reported that during a previous visit in March 2007 to the local hospital, the 
doctor stated that he needed further tests after a period of about a month but he was not allowed 
to do so. Moreover, it was alleged that on 26 July 2007, the prisoner was unable to attend a court 
hearing because of his serious health condition but the prison doctor was subpoenaed to give 
evidence on Mr. Golley&#8217;s condition, which he did under oath. The doctor offered no date for 
Mr. Golley&#8217;s return to court and stated that he was in immediate need of diagnosis and treatment 
which he could not offer within the prison. With a view to Mr. Golley&#8217;s alleged health problems 
and the denial to offer adequate medical treatment, fear was expressed for his physical and 
mental integrity.

<p>53. On 10 August 2007, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on housing, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to health sent an urgent appeal concerning 149 Lao Hmong 
people at Nong Khai Immigration Detention Centre (IDC), of whom 90 were children 
and babies. All of them were recognized as refugees by UNHCR. According to the 
information received, the Hmong group was arrested by immigration police in Bangkok on 
17 November 2006 and on 8 December 2006 the group was transferred from Bangkok to 
Nong Khai IDC. On 30 January 2007, the authorities attempted to deport them to Laos but failed 
due to strong resistance by the group. On 12 and 29 June 2007, seven Lao Hmong men escaped 
from Nong Khai IDC, which caused the immigration officials to apply stricter measures towards 
the Lao Hmong. According to subsequent reports, the conditions of detention deteriorated. 
Allegedly, all of them were confined to tiny cells, without access to daylight, and were not 
allowed to leave the cells. It was further alleged that they had no access to clean, potable water 
and had to drink water from the bathrooms inside the cells. According to reports these 
restrictions as well as limited access to medical care caused the spreading of diseases, such as 
rashes, diarrhoea, respiratory infections and fever, especially among children. Furthermore, it 
was reported that contact with the outside world was not permitted and ten video cameras, 
directly connected to Bangkok Immigration, were installed to monitor detainees&#8217; activities. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received

<p>54. By letter dated 7 November 2007, the Government stated that from the time the joint 
urgent appeal was sent until the moment when the reply was written, the situation of the Laotian 
Hmongs in the Nong Khain IDC had improved considerably. Proper consideration was given to </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/11/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>the needs of these people, particularly the children. It was further explained that the center in 
Nong Khai was not constructed to respond to this particular situation or to a large influx of 
illegal migrants entering Thailand. The Government confirmed that after seven Laotian Hmongs 
escaped from the detention center, stricter measures were adopted. As a protest, the group started 
a hunger strike that lasted for four days. Even before the hunger strike occurred, the Immigration 
Bureau was already seeking approval for budgetary funding from the Government to expand 
facilities at the IDC. The Government refuted the allegations concerning the prisoners&#8217; lack of 
access to daylight and potable water. Except for the period that followed the referred escapes 
until the end of the hunger strike, the detainees were allowed to move around outside the 
detention rooms during the day. Clean water and food was offered to every detainee. It was also 
affirmed that medical care was provided to the Laotian Hmongs on a daily basis and that no 
serious diseases were found among the group. The Government considered the Laotian Hmongs 
mentioned to be illegal immigrants. As a consequence, they were subject to judicial process in 
accordance with the national legislation. However, the Government stated that the treatment 
given to these illegal immigrants was compliant with humanitarian principles and respectful to 
their human rights.

right to health sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. Donchu, currently held at Artemovsky SIZO 
(pre-trial detention centre), Donetsk Region. According to the allegations received, Mr. Donchu 
was arrested on 22 June 2005, already in poor health. At the time of the communication, he was 
allegedly diagnosed with &#8220;rheumatism (inactive phase), combined hart valve disease with a 
stenosis of the aortic isthmus, cardiac decompensation at 2B stage (on admission, cardiac 
decompensation had been at 2A stage), hypertension, chronic ciliary tachyarrhythmia 
accompanied by chronic bronchitis and respiratory failure of 1 degree&#8221;. The ward&#8217;s medical 
chief concluded that Mr. Donchu was seriously somatically ill and therefore needed proper 
treatment and further examination at a specialized (cardiologic) institution. Furthermore, at a 
recent court hearing, when an ambulance had to be called to treat Mr. Donchu, the treating 
doctor found that Mr. Donchu &#8220;was on the brink of a micro stroke or a micro infarction.&#8221; Given 
the refusal to hospitalize the prisoner despite the consistent medical advice to this end, concern 
was expressed for Mr. Donchu&#8217;s physical and mental integrity.

authorities, was arrested on suspicion of the commission of an offence covered by article 364, 
paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Upon entering the Artemovsk remand centre 
on 4 July 2005, Mr. Donchu was examined at the centre&#8217;s medical unit and referred for 
treatment. During his custody in the remand centre, the detainee repeatedly received medical </p>

<p>assistance - including, in 2005, specialized treatment in the local health care unit of the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Health. In addition, Mr. Donchu was examined by specialist from the 
cardiology division of Artemovsk central district hospital on five separate occasions. At the time 
of the reply, the detainee&#8217;s health state was consistent with the chronic illness from which he was 
found to be suffering, therefore being submitted to regular check-ups and proper treatment. The 
Government also reported that despite the several attempts of Mr. Donchu and his legal counsel 
to judicially have the measure of restraint to be replaced by a non-custodial measure, the court 
rejected all the applications. During the court hearings on 12 and 26 June 2007, emergency 
medical services were called when Mr. Donchu suffered health crises; however, the doctors that 
took care of him attested that Mr. Donchu was in no danger of a heart attack and did not need to 
be hospitalized. Finally, the Government affirmed that Mr. Donchu was being treated in 
accordance with the doctor&#8217;s recommendations and monitored by specialists, being sufficiently 
healthy to participate in the court hearings.

Yislam Al-Kazimi, Yemeni national, and Fahd Muhammed Abdullah Al-Fawzan, a Saudi 
national, both of whom were, at the time of the communication, detained at the U.S. Naval Base 
in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

<p>58. According to the information received Mr. Al-Kazimi was arrested in Dubai, United Arab 
Emirates, in early January 2003 and was detained for eight months and 16 days. While in 
detention in Dubai, it is alleged that he was subjected to spatial and temporal disorientation by 
having his eyes and ears covered and by being held in complete darkness. It was reported that on 
or about 16 to 18 August 2003, he was transferred to the custody of United States forces and 
taken to Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was held for nine months. It is alleged that he was 
physically and psychologically tortured by Jordanian interrogators under the supervision of U.S. 
personnel and he attempted suicide three times by hitting his head into the cell wall. It was 
further reported that on or about 16 May 2004, he was transferred to Bagram, where he was held 
in U.S. custody for four months and tortured. According to the information received on or about 
18 September 2004, he was taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he was detained at the time 
of the communication. It is reported that the detainee was suffering from chronic constipation, 
haemorrhoids, and blood in his faeces since his detention. Moreover, it is alleged that he was not 
permitted to see a lawyer, relatives or friends before his transfer to Guantanamo Bay, and also 
that he has not seen any member of his family since his arrest in early 2003. 
</p>

<p>was held for two months. It is alleged that while in detention in Afghanistan, Mr. Al-Fawzan was 
threatened with firearms, strangled with wires and shocked with electricity by unidentified U.S. 
officials. It was further reported that in early 2002, he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
where he was detained at the time of the communication. While in Guantanamo, he allegedly 
suffered severe abuse and torture in the course of interrogations. It was reported that he had not 
seen any member of his family since his departure for Afghanistan in October 2001.

tortured for purposes of intimidation, coercion to extract information and punishment for not 
complying with demands by U.S. personnel. In addition, it is alleged that prisoners in 
Guantanamo routinely refused to ask for medical treatment due to a fear that treatment would be 
withheld or that knowledge of their medical condition by interrogators would be exacerbated 
during interrogations. As a consequence, both detainees refused medical treatment.

<p>65. On 25 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health sent an urgent appeal 
concerning serious delays in the procurement of anti-retroviral drugs, which are produced in the 
United States of America and destined for HIV/AIDS patients in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
under a project financed by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. According 
to the information received, UNDP Iran has aimed to import anti-retroviral medicines for 
HIV/AIDS patients in Iran as part of the Global Fund project. Reportedly, an order was placed 
on 6 December 2005 for eleven types of anti-retroviral medicines, out of which six were 
received during the period of February to April 2006. However, the remaining five items, all 
manufactured by U.S. companies, had reportedly not been shipped because of delays in the 
issuance of the required licenses by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of 
Treasury. These medications are reported to be components of triple combination therapy, which 
cannot start without all three elements being available. According to the reports, the Iranian 
Transactions Regulations-31 C.F.R. Part 650, issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, 
indicates that medicines, which are intended to relieve human suffering, are permitted to be 
exported to Iran. The medications in question are essential for HIV/AIDS patients, and should 
therefore be legally authorized in a timely manner by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
Furthermore, it is reported that of the five medications only one has an acceptable substitute 
approved by the World Health Organization, which is produced outside of the United States.

<p>66. On 24 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to health sent an urgent appeal regarding Samil Al-Haj, a Sudanese cameraman who 
worked for Al-Jazeera and who has been detained in Guantanamo since June 2002. According to 
the information received Samil Al-Haj was arrested by Pakistani security forces at the Afghan 
border in December 2001 and transferred to US military custody in the Guantanamo Bay 
military base in June 2002, where he remained in detention ever since. Reportedly, Mr. Al-Haj 
began a hunger strike in December 2006 to protest against his detention. According to his 
lawyer, he had lost 18 kilograms and was suffering from intestinal problems. It was alleged that 
Mr. Al-Haj&#8217;s hunger strike has been followed by reprisals from medical and military personnel 
and that he was force fed. Allegedly, medical personnel had inflicted injuries on Mr. Al-Haj and 
other detainees on hunger strike by using large-diameter tubes or by inserting them into the 
lungs rather than the stomach. Four prisoners had allegedly died since June 2006 as a result of 
hunger-strikes and force-feeding. According to reports, the mental condition of Mr Samil Al-Haj 
has deteriorated and he exhibited signs of anxiety and paranoia attacks. At the time of the 
communication, no charges had been brought against Mr. Al-Haj.

<p>67. On 13 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health sent an urgent appeal 
regarding late Arellano Victoria, a 23-year old Mexican citizen, transgender and HIV patient 
who had been detained at San Pedro Detention Centre, California. According to the information 
received Arellano went by the name Victoria, was deported to Mexico in 2003. After that he was 
reportedly detained in early May 2007 for entering the United States of America illegally for the 
second time, and was awaiting a hearing to determine whether he could be deported to Mexico. 
Before his detention, he was prescribed a daily dose of Bactrim, a prophylactic given to HIV 
patients to prevent pulmonary infections from developing into life-threatening pneumonia. 
Arellano was later switched to Dapasone, another antibiotic, which he was taking when he was 
detained at San Pedro Detention Centre in May 2007. It is alleged that Arellano was denied 
medicines upon detention at the San Pedro Detention Centre, even though Dapasone is a potent 
anti-leprosy drug used as a preventive measure against pneumocystis pneumonia. Reportedly, 
Arellano spent most of his days in a bunk bed, complaining of debilitating headaches, back pain 
and stomach cramps. It is alleged that despite Arellano vomiting blood, no medical attention was 
provided to him. Eventually, when Arellano&#8217;s condition became critical, he was transferred by 
ambulance to San Pedro Hospital. Though too weak to walk to the bathroom alone and 
experiencing intense vomiting and bouts of diarrhoea, it is alleged that barely 24 hours later, he 
was returned to the detention centre. Subsequently, he was transferred to the Little Company of 
Mary Hospital&#8217;s intensive care unit, where he died on July 20, 2007. At the time of his death, 
Arellano was alleged to have been shackled to a hospital bed. </p>

<p>68. On 10 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health sent an urgent appeal 
with the independent expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing and 
the Special Rapporteur on toxic wastes concerning the issue of emergency medical treatment for 
internally displaced persons affected by lead contamination in northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;. The 
informed medical evidence revealed widespread lead poisoning among persons belonging to 
Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian minority groups who lived in or still live in the &#381;itkovac/Zhikovc, 
&#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; and Kablare/Kablar camps. Moreover, it was alleged that the 
Osterode camp where IDPs were voluntarily moved was also located on contaminated soil and 
the effectiveness of medical treatment is contingent upon removing affected persons from the 
source of poisoning where as it was referred to as a &#8220;lead-safer environment&#8221; in the press release 
of 1 September 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>69. By letter dated 16 April 2007, United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo 
(UNMIK) reported that after transfers, 395 RAE are still living in Camp Osterode and 100 at 
Cesmin Lug. Primary health care services are provided in Cesmin Lug and, even though Serbian 
politicians are opposed to any forced relocation, UNMIK is making efforts to convince the 
remaining occupants to voluntarily move to Roma Mahala. WHO monitors periodically Camp 
Osterode for lead contamination and its Chelaton Therapy clinic (operational since March 2006), 
in which 37 children out of 100 were treated, will be moved to Roma Mahala once the 
ambulanta, under construction at the time when the letter was written, is completed. UNMIK 
planned to hand over Camp Osterode to a successor organization by the end of 2007.
