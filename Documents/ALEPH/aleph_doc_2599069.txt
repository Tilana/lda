MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements and all information in the annual report are the responsibility of the 
Board  of  Directors  and  management.    The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  by 
management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.  Management maintains 
the  necessary  systems  of  internal  controls,  policies  and  procedures  to  provide  assurance  that  assets  are 
safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable and form a proper basis for the preparation of financial 
statements.
The Board of Directors ensures that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and internal 
control through an Audit Committee.  This committee, which reports to the Board of Directors, meets with the 
independent auditors and reviews the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by MacKay LLP, Chartered Accountants, who were 
appointed by the shareholders.  The auditors’ report outlines the scope of their examination and their opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding  the  reliability  of  the  Company’s  financial  reporting  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with 
accounting principles generally accepted in Canada and in the United States of America.  Internal control over 
financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; providing reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance 
with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and providing reasonable assurance 
that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our 
financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Because of its inherent limitations, 
internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of 
our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  This evaluation included review of 
the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating 
effectiveness  of  controls  and  a  conclusion  on  this  evaluation.    Based  on  this  evaluation,  management 
concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2009.

Auditors' Report
To the Shareholders of
International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. as at May 31, 2009, 
2008 and 2007 and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss and deficit and cash flows 
for the years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  in  Canada  and  the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that 
we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the company as at May 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the results of its operations and its cash flows 
for the years then ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Comments by Auditors for U.S. Readers on Canada – United States Reporting Differences
In  the  United  States,  reporting  standards  for  auditors  require  the  addition  of  an  explanatory  paragraph 
(following the opinion paragraph) when the financial statements are affected by conditions and events that 
cast substantial doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, such as those described in 
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.  Our report to the shareholders dated August 6, 2009, is 
expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards which do not permit a reference to such events 
and  conditions  in  the  auditor’s  report  when  these  are  adequately  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements.  
Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  vary  in  certain  significant  respects  from  accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States.  Application of accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States would have affected results of operations for each of the years in the three year period 
ended May 31, 2009 and shareholders’ equity as at May 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 to the extent summarized 
in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

INTERNATIONAL TOWER HILL MINES LTD.
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars) 
Years ended May 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
1.
NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
The Company is in the business of acquiring, exploring and evaluating mineral properties, and either 
joint venturing or developing these properties further or disposing of them when the evaluation is 
completed.  At May 31, 2009, the Company was in the exploration stage and had interests in properties 
in Alaska and Nevada, U.S.A.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally 
accepted accounting principles on a going concern basis, which presume the realization of assets and 
discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  The Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern has been dependent upon achieving profitable operations and/or 
obtaining additional financing.  During the current year the Company has raised $37,913,974 (2008 – 
$1,209,275; 2007 - $29,978,674) through the issuance of share capital and has working capital at May 
31, 2009 of $32,459,316 (2008 - $10,600,403; 2007 - $21,163,884) which is considered sufficient to 
fund  its  operations  and  exploration  program  for  the  ensuing  year.    These  consolidated  financial 
statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that 
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in business.
The business of mining and exploration involves a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance 
that current exploration programs will result in profitable mining operations.  The Company has no 
source  of  revenue,  and  has  significant  cash  requirements  to  meet  its  administrative  overhead  and 
maintain its mineral property interests.  The recoverability of amounts shown for mineral properties is 
dependent on several factors.  These include the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the 
ability  of  the  Company  to  obtain  the  necessary  financing  to  complete  the  development  of  these 
properties, and future profitable production or proceeds from disposition of mineral properties.  The 
carrying value of the Company’s mineral property interests does not reflect current or future values.
2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  following  is  a  summary  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  used  by  management  in  the 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted 
accounting principles.
a)  Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of International Tower Hill Mines 
Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Talon Gold Alaska, Inc. (an Alaska corporation), Talon 
Gold  (US)  LLC  (a  Colorado  limited  liability  company),  Talon  Gold  Nevada  Inc.  (a  Nevada 
corporation) and 813034 Alberta Ltd. (an Alberta corporation).  All intercompany transactions and 
balances have been eliminated.

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
b)  Cash equivalents
The Company considers cash equivalents to consist of highly liquid investments that are cashable 
on demand, and which are subject to insignificant credit and interest rate risk.
At May 31, 2009, the Company held  a total of $10,004,000 short term investments which consist 
of  $3,002,000  of  Government  of  Canada  Treasury  Bills  due  June  11,  2009  bearing  interest at 
0.222% per annum, $2,002,000 of Bank of Nova Scotia Bankers Acceptance due July 06, 2009 
bearing interest at 0.163% per annum, $2,500,000 of Montreal Trust GIC due March 12, 2010 
bearing interest at 0.90% per annum and $2,500,000 TD Mortgage Corp GIC due March 12, 2010 
bearing interest at 0.80% per annum (2008 - $8,721,062 of Bank of Nova Scotia bank discount note 
due June 26, 2008 bearing interest at 3.08% per annum; 2007 - $5,002,500).
c) Marketable securities
Marketable securities are classified as held-for-trading, and are carried at quoted market value, 
where applicable, or at an estimate of fair value.  Resulting realized and unrealized gains or losses, 
net of applicable income taxes, are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
d)  Foreign currency translation
Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  at  period-end  exchange  rates;  other  assets  and 
liabilities  have  been  translated  at  the  rates  prevailing  at  the  date  of  transaction.    Revenue  and 
expense items, except for amortization, are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period. 
 Amortization is converted using rates prevailing at dates of acquisition.  Gains and losses from 
foreign currency translation are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
e)  Property and equipment
Property  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  amortization.    Amortization  is 
recorded over the estimated useful life of the assets at the following annual rates: 
Computer equipment 
Furniture and equipment 
Computer software 
Leasehold improvements
30% declining balance 
20% declining balance  
3 years straight line 
straight-line over the remaining lease term
- 
- 
- 
-
f)  Mineral properties
Mineral properties consist of mining claims, leases and options.  Acquisition options, leasehold and 
exploration costs are capitalized and deferred until such time as the property is put into production 
or the properties are disposed of either through sale or abandonment.  If the property is put into 
production, the costs of acquisition and exploration will be written-off over the life of the property, 
based  on  estimated  economic  reserves.    Proceeds  received  from  the  sale  of  any  interest  in  a 
property will first be credited against the carrying value of the property, with any excess included 
in operations for the period.  If a property is abandoned, the property and deferred exploration costs 
will be written-off to operations in the period of abandonment.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
f)  Mineral properties (cont’d)
Recorded costs of mineral properties and deferred exploration and development expenditures are 
not intended to reflect present or future values of mineral properties.
Deferred costs related to mineral property interests are periodically reviewed for impairment.  A 
review for potential impairment is subject to potentially material measurement uncertainty.  If a 
review indicates that a mineral property interest has been impaired the related deferred costs are 
written down or written off.
Although  the  Company  has  taken  steps  to  verify  title  to mineral properties in which it has an 
interest, based on industry norms for the current stage of exploration of such properties, these 
procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title.  Property title may be subject to unregistered 
prior agreements and inadvertent non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
g)  Asset retirement obligation
The Company has adopted the CICA Handbook Section 3110 “asset retirement obligations” which 
establishes  standards  for  the  recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure  of  liabilities  for  asset 
retirement  obligations  and  the  associated  asset  retirement  costs.    The  standards  apply  to  legal 
obligations  associated  with  the  retirement  of  long-lived  tangible  assets  that  arise  from  the 
acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets.  The standards require 
that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
and  when  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  can  be  made.    Furthermore,  a 
corresponding asset retirement cost is recognized by increasing the carrying amount of the related 
long-lived asset.  The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated in a rational and systematic 
method over the underlying asset’s useful life.  The initial fair value of the liability is accreted, by 
charges to operations, to its estimated future value.
h)  Share capital
The Company has adopted the residual value method with respect to the measurement of shares and 
warrants issued as private placement units.  The residual value method first allocates value to the 
more easily measurable component based on fair value and then the residual value, if any, to the 
less easily measurable component.
The fair value of the common shares issued in the private placements was determined to be the 
more  easily  measurable  component  and  were  valued  at  their  fair  value,  as  determined  by  the 
closing quoted bid price on the announcement date.  The balance, if any, was allocated to the 
attached warrants.  Any fair value attributed to the warrants is recorded as warrants.
Share capital issued as non-monetary consideration is recorded at the fair market value of the 
shares issued, which is determined by the Board of Directors of the Company and is generally 
based on the trading price of the shares at the time an agreement to issue shares has been reached.
Share  issue  costs  incurred  on  the  issue  of  the  Company’s  shares  are  charged  directly to share

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
i)  Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 
the period.  The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year was 45,089,555 
(2008 – 39,193,360; 2007 – 27,101,104).  Diluted loss per share has not been presented separately 
as the outstanding options and warrants are anti-dilutive for each of the periods presented.
The  Company  uses  the  treasury  stock  method  of  calculating  fully  diluted  per  share  amounts 
whereby any proceeds from the exercise of stock options or other dilutive instruments are assumed 
to be used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the year.
j)
Income tax
Income taxes are accounted for using the future income tax method.  Under this method income 
taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable for the current year and future income 
taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and 
liabilities and for the benefit of losses available to be carried forward for tax purposes that are more 
likely than not to be realized.  Future income taxes assets and liabilities are measured using tax 
rates  expected  to  apply  in  the  years  in  which  the  temporary  differences  are  expected  to  be 
recovered or settled.  To the extent that future income tax assets are not considered more likely than 
not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
k) Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using a fair value based method with respect 
to all stock-based payments measured and recognized, to directors, employees and non-employees. 
 For directors and employees, the fair value of the options is measured at the date of grant.  For 
non-employees, the fair value of the options is measured on the earlier of the date at which the 
counterparty performance is completed or the date the performance commitment is reached or the 
date at which the equity instruments are granted if they are fully vested and non-forfeitable.  The 
fair value of the options, determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is accrued and 
charged either to operations or mineral properties, with the offset credit to contributed surplus.  For 
directors and employees the options are recognized over the vesting period, and for non-employees 
the  options  are  recognized  over  the  related  service  period.    If  and  when  the  stock  options  are 
ultimately exercised, the applicable amounts of contributed surplus are transferred to share capital.
l)
Joint venture accounting
Where  the  Company’s  exploration  and  development  activities  are  conducted  with  others,  the 
accounts reflect only the Company’s proportionate interest in such activities.

2.       SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
m) Measurement uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount 
of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial 
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those reported.
Significant  areas  requiring  the  use  of  management  estimates  relate  to  the  determination  of 
impairment of mineral properties and determination of the fair value of asset retirement obligations. 
By  their  nature,  these  estimates  and  related  future  cash  flows  are  subject  to  measurement 
uncertainty, and the impact on the financial statements of future periods could be material.
n) Capital disclosures
In February 2007, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants’ (“CICA”) issued Handbook 
Section  1535,  “Capital  Disclosures”,  which  requires  the  disclosure  of  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative information that provides users of financial statements with information to evaluate the 
entity’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital.  The new section is effective for 
years  beginning  on  or  after  October  1,  2007  and  was  adopted  June  1,  2008.    Other  than  the 
additional disclosure in Note 12, the adoption of this Section has had no impact on the Company’s 
consolidated financial statements.
o) Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement; Disclosure and Presentation
This standard sets out criteria for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments for 
fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2006.  This standard requires all financial instruments 
within its scope, including derivatives, to be included on a Company’s balance sheet and measured 
either  at  fair  value  or,  in  certain  circumstances  when  fair  value  may  not  be  considered  most 
relevant, at cost or amortized cost.  Changes in fair value are to be recognized in the statements of 
operations or comprehensive income.
All financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the entity becomes a party to the contract 
creating the item.  As such, any of the Company’s outstanding financial assets and liabilities at the 
effective date of adoption are recognized and measured in accordance with the new requirements as 
if these requirements had always been in effect.  Any changes to the fair values of assets and 
liabilities  prior  to  June  1,  2007  were  recognized  by  adjusting  opening  deficit  or  opening 
accumulated other comprehensive income.
All financial instruments are classified into one of the following five categories: held for trading, 
held-to-maturity,  loans  and  receivables,  available-for-sale  financial  assets,  or  other  financial 
liabilities.  Initial and subsequent measurement and recognition of changes in the value of financial 
instruments  depends  on  their  initial  classification.    Transaction  costs  related  to  financial 
instruments will be expensed in the period incurred.

2.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
o)    Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement; Disclosure and Presentation (cont’d)
The Company classified its financial instruments as follows: 
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
(cid:120)
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as held for trading. 
 Accounts receivable are classified as loans and receivables. 
 Marketable securities are classified as held for trading. 
 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities have been classified as other liabilities.
The  new  Sections  3862  and  3863  replace  Handbook  Section  3861,  Financial  Instruments  – 
Disclosure  and  Presentation,  revising  and  enhancing  its  disclosure  requirements,  and  carrying 
forward unchanged its presentation requirements.  These new sections place increased emphasis on 
disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and how the 
entity manages those risks.  These new standards were adopted on June 1, 2008.
p)   Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is the change in shareholders’ equity during a period from transactions and 
other events from non-owner sources.  This standard requires certain gains and losses that would 
otherwise be recorded as part of the net earnings to be presented in other “comprehensive income” 
until they are considered appropriate to recognize into net earnings.  This standard requires the 
presentation of comprehensive income, and its components in a separate financial statement that is 
displayed  with  the  same  prominence  as  the  other  financial  statements.    There  are  no  material 
differences between comprehensive income (loss) and net loss for the years reported.
q)   Assessing Going Concern
The Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) amended CICA Handbook Section 1400, to include 
requirements  for  management  to  assess  and  disclose  an  entity’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going 
concern.  This section applies to interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years 
beginning on or after January 1, 2008.  This section relates to disclosures and did not have an 
impact on the Company’s financial results, when adopted by the Company on June 1, 2008.
r)   Future accounting changes
i)   Goodwill and Intangible Assets
In  February  2008,  the  CICA  issued  Handbook  Section  3064  “Goodwill  and  Intangible 
Assets”, replacing Section 3062, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, and Section 3450, 
“Research and Development Costs”.  These sections establish standards for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of goodwill subsequent to its initial recognition 
and of intangible assets by profit-oriented enterprises.  Standards concerning goodwill are 
unchanged from the standards included in the previous Section 3062.  The new sections are 
effective  for  years  beginning  on  or  after  October  1,  2008.    The  Company  believes  the 
adoption of these new sections will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements, 
when adopted June 1, 2009.

ii)
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
In 2006, the AcSB published a new strategic plan that will significantly affect financial 
reporting  requirements  for  Canadian  companies.    The  AcSB  strategic  plan  outlines  the 
convergence of Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) with IFRS 
over an expected five year transitional period.  In February 2008 the AcSB announced that 
2011 is the changeover date for publicly-listed companies to use IFRS, replacing Canada's 
own GAAP.  The date is for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years 
beginning on or after January 1, 2011.  The transition date of June 1, 2011 will require the 
restatement for comparative purposes of amounts reported by the Company for the years 
ended May 31, 2011 and earlier where applicable.  While the Company has begun assessing 
the adoption of IFRS for 2011, the financial reporting impact of the transition to IFRS cannot 
be reasonably estimated at this time.
iii)   Business combinations
In January 2009, the CICA issued Handbook Section 1582, Business Combinations, which 
replaces the existing standards.  This section establishes the standards for the accounting of 
business combinations, and states that all assets and liabilities of an acquired business will be 
recorded at fair value.  Estimated obligations for contingent considerations and contingencies 
will  also  be  recorded  at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.    The  standard  also  states  that 
acquisition-related costs will be expensed as incurred and that restructuring charges will be 
expensed  in  the  periods  after  the  acquisition  date.    This  standard  is  equivalent  to  the 
International Financial Reporting Standards on business combinations.  This standard is 
applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 
2011.  Earlier adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of 
adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
iv)   Consolidated financial statements
In  January  2009,  the  CICA  issued  Handbook  Section  1601,  consolidated  financial 
statements, which replaces the existing standards.  This section establishes the standards for 
preparing  consolidated  financial  statements  and  is  effective  for  interim  and  annual 
consolidated financial statements beginning on or after January 1, 2011.  The Company is 
currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  adopting  this  standard  on  its  consolidated  financial 
statements.
v)   Non controlling interests
In January 2009, the CICA issued Handbook Section 1602, Non-controlling interests, which 
establishes standards for the accounting of non-controlling interests of a subsidiary in the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements subsequent to a business combination.  This 
standard is equivalent to the International Financial Reporting Standards on consolidated and 
separate financial statements.  This standard is effective for interim and annual consolidated 
financial statements beginning on or after January 1, 2011.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity 
of these financial instruments.
The  Company’s  risk  exposure  and  the  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial  instruments  are 
summarized below:
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counter-party to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The Company manages credit risk, in respect of cash 
and cash equivalents, by purchasing highly liquid, short-term investment-grade securities held at 
major Canadian financial institutions in accordance with the Company’s investment policy.  The 
credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents is minimized substantially by ensuring that 
these  financial  assets  are  placed  with  major  Canadian  financial  institutions  with  strong 
investment-grade  ratings  by  a  primary  ratings  agency.    The  Company  has  no  asset  backed 
securities.
The Company’s concentration of credit risk and maximum exposure thereto is as follows relating 
to financial assets:
Cash and cash equivalents 
Accounts receivable
$    32,489,341 
  $           76,634
$  10,859,942 
$           24,833
$  21,908,273
$         113,870
2009
2008
2007
The Company’s cash at May 31, 2009 consists of $32,409,242 in Canada and $80,099 in the 
United States.  Concentration of credit risk exists with respect to the Company’s Canadian cash 
and cash equivalents as all amounts are held at major Canadian financial institutions.  Credit risk 
with regard to cash held in United State is mitigated as the amount held in the United States is 
only sufficient to cover short-term requirements.  With respect to receivables at May 31, 2009, 
the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk as the majority are from governmental and 
regulatory agencies or related parties.
(b)  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as 
they fall due.  The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to provide reasonable 
assurance that it will have sufficient funds to meet liabilities when due.  The Company manages 
its  liquidity  risk  by  forecasting  cash  flows  from  operations  and  anticipated  investing  and 
financing activities.  The Company normally maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to 
meet  the  Company’s  business  requirements.    At  May  31,  2009,  the  Company  had  accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities of $386,673 (2008 - $724,798; 2007 - $955,363), which are all 
payable within six months.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont’d)
(c)  Market risk
Market  risk  is  the  risk  that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in market prices.  Market risk comprises four types of risk: interest 
rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and other price risk.
i.   Interest rate risk
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consists of cash held in bank accounts and short 
term deposit certificates of GIC’s with several major Canadian financial institutions that earn 
interest at varying interest rates.  Due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments, 
fluctuations in market rates do not have a significant impact on estimated fair values as of 
May 31, 2009.  Future cash flows from interest income on cash and cash equivalents will be 
affected  by  interest  rate  fluctuations.    The  Company  manages  interest  rate  risk  by 
maintaining  an  investment  policy  that  focuses  primarily  on  preservation  of  capital  and 
liquidity.  The Company’s sensitivity analysis suggests that a 1% change in interest rates 
would affect interest income by approximately $100,000.
ii.   Foreign currency risk
The  Company  is  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risk  to  the  extent  that  certain  monetary 
financial  instruments  and  other  assets  are  denominated  in  United  States  dollars.    The 
Company  has  not  entered  into  any  foreign  currency  contracts  to  mitigate  this  risk,  as  it 
believes this risk is minimized by the minimal amount of cash held in United States funds.  
The Company’s sensitivity analysis suggests that a consistent 5% change in the absolute rate 
of exchange for the United States dollars, the foreign currency for which the Company has 
net  assets  employed,  would  affect  net  assets  and  foreign  exchange  gain  (loss)  by 
approximately $315,000.
As at May 31, 2009, the Company had the following financial instruments in US$:
Cash
Accounts payables and accrued liabilities
295,418 
  $
  $       250,793
$           270,604
$          229,727
CAD$ equivalent
US$
As at May 31, 2009, US$ amounts were converted at a rate of US$ to $1.0917 Canadian 
dollars.
iii.  Other price risk
Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate 
risk  or  foreign  exchange  risk  or  commodity  price  risk.    The  Company  has  no  financial 
instruments exposed to such risk.

INTERNATIONAL TOWER HILL MINES LTD.
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars) 
Years ended May 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
6.  MINERAL PROPERTIES (cont’d)
(a)  Siwash Silver Claims, B.C.
On September 22, 2006, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Ravencrest Resources 
Inc. (“Ravencrest”) whereby Ravencrest will acquire all of the Company’s interest in ninety-seven 
mineral claims and one lot in exchange for the Company retaining a 5% net smelter returns royalty 
and  Ravencrest’s  assumption  of  all  liabilities  and risks concerning the property.  The original 
mining venture agreement dated March 31, 2005 between the Company and Ravencrest was also 
terminated.  Accordingly, the Company wrote down the Siwash Silver Claims to a nominal value 
of $1, recognizing a charge to operations of $1,030,315 during the year ended May 31, 2007.
The Company had pledged a $2,500 term deposit as reclamation security for work on Siwash 
property as required by the Province of British Columbia.  During the fiscal year ended May 31, 
2008, the deposit was returned to the Company.
(b)  BMP Project, Alaska
In  September,  2006,  the  Company  staked  a  total  of  108  Alaska  state  mining  claims  at  a  new 
location in the Bethel Recording District.  The claims cover a base metal target developed from the 
Company’s exploration program conducted in 2006.
On  March  26, 2008, the Company executed an agreement with respect to the exploration and 
option to lease of key exploration ground adjoining the Company’s BMP claim block from Cook 
Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI), an Alaska Native Regional Corporation.
ITH and CIRI have signed an exploration agreement with an option to lease, covering a 6,200 
hectare area located immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the Company’s existing BMP claim 
block.  The general terms of the agreement are as follows:
Exploration Agreement (2 year initial term with automatic 3 year renewal)
(cid:127) Payments: Annual rental payment of USD 20,000 per year for the first 2 years (paid), 
increasing to USD 40,000 for years 3 through 5. At the end of year 2, the Company will be 
required to reduce the lands subject to the agreement by 50% unless otherwise justifiable 
geologically, in which case a bonus of USD 5.00 per acre is payable upon the renewal for all 
lands retained in excess of 3,100 hectares. 
(cid:127) Work Commitments: USD 275,000 in year 1 escalating to USD 500,000 in year 5. 
(cid:127) Lease Option: Upon having expended a minimum of USD 800,000, drilled 2,500 feet of 
core drilling and produced a positive pre-feasibility study over an area within the CIRI lands 
that contains mineralization and may be capable of development into a mine, the Company 
may elect to enter into a mining lease over the ground that is the subject to the positive pre-
feasibility study.

6.  MINERAL PROPERTIES (cont’d)
(b)  BMP Project, Alaska (cont’d)
Mining Lease (15 year initial term, and so long thereafter as commercial production continues)
(cid:127) Advance Minimum Royalty: Payments of USD 150,000 in years 1-3, USD 200,000 in 
years  4-5  and  USD  400,000  for  year  6  and  beyond  (unless  a  feasibility  study  has  been 
completed). AMR payments are 50% deductible from royalty payments. 
(cid:127) Sliding  Scale  Royalty:  An  NSR  Royalty  of  between  1  and  2.5%  before  payback  and 
between 3 and 5% (depending upon the gold price) after payback is payable in respect of 
precious metals, and an NSR Royalty of 1% before payback and 3% after payback is payable 
in  respect  of  base  metals.    In  both  cases,  CIRI  will  have  the  option  to  replace  the  NSR 
Royalty with a Net Profits Interest Royalty (10% before payback and 20% after). 
(cid:127) CIRI Participation Option: Upon a production decision being made, CIRI will have the 
right to acquire up to a 15% working interest in the leased area by contributing 2 times its 
pro rata share of the cumulative project expenditures by the Company (other than AMR 
payments) to the date of the exercise of CIRI’s participation option.
The Company will also make annual donations of USD 10,000 (paid USD 20,000) to the CIRI 
Foundation or other scholarship fund designated by CIRI during the continuance of the exploration.
(c)  West Tanana Project, Alaska
On August 14, 2006, the Company acquired an interest in the West Tanana Project from Doyon 
Limited  (“Doyon”),  an  Alaska  Native  Regional  Corporation,  by  way  of  a  mining  exploration 
agreement  with  the  option  to  lease.    The  agreement  with  Doyon  is  a  two  stage  Exploration 
Option/Mining Lease, whereby the Company has the option to enter into one or more mining leases 
over some or all of the Doyon conveyed lands (25,920 acres) and up to three leases totalling 8,000 
acres over the Doyon selected lands (25,872 acres) subject to the exploration option agreement.
In order to maintain the option to lease in good standing, the Company is required to pay Doyon 
USD 350,000 over six years (five years plus one year extension, USD 50,000 first year), make 
annual scholarship donations of USD 10,000 per year (paid USD 100,000 in lease payment and 
USD  20,000  in  scholarship  donations);  and  incur  exploration  expenditures  totalling  USD 
2,625,000, subject to reduction to USD 2,125,000 if the lands subject to the option are reduced by 
50% or more (USD 75,000 commitment for the first year).  If the Company does not terminate the 
option prior to January 1 in any option year, the specified minimum expenditures for that year 
become a commitment.
At any time during the option period, the Company may enter into a mining lease with Doyon with 
respect to any one or more area(s) of the lands in respect of which it has expended at least USD 
600,000, carried out at least 10,000 feet of core drilling, and submitted a pre-feasibility study.  
Each mining lease will have a term of 15 years and for so long thereafter as commercial production 
continues and requires advance minimum royalty payments of USD 250,000 per year during the 
first  five  years  of  the  term.    The  Company  is  also  required  to  incur  minimum  mandatory 
exploration expenditures equal to the greater of USD 25/acre or USD 250,000 for each of the first 
five years

and USD 50/acre or USD 500,000 in the sixth and each succeeding year.  If, on or before the 5th 
year of the term, the Company has not produced a feasibility study and made a production decision, 
the  annual  advance  minimum  royalty  payments  increase  to  USD  500,000.    Advance  royalty 
payments are credited against 50% of production royalties.  Upon commencement of commercial 
production, the Company is required to pay a production royalty on precious metals, calculated as 
the greater of 2% of net smelter returns pre-payout and 4% of net smelter returns post-payout or 
10% of net profits pre-payout and 20% of net profits post payout, and on base metals, calculated as 
the greater of 1% of net smelter returns pre-payout and 3% of net smelter return post-payout or 
10%  of  net  profits  pre-payout  and  20%  of  net  profits  post  payout.    Payout  occurs  when  the 
Company  has  recouped  cumulative  gross  revenues  from  production  equal  to  its  cumulative 
expenditures since the effective date of the lease.  Upon the Company having made a production 
decision with respect to any leased area, Doyon will also have the right to acquire a minimum of 
5%, and a maximum of 10%, participating interest in the Company’s interest in that leased area by 
contributing  an  amount  equal  to  2.25  times  Doyon’s  elected  percentage  of  the  Company’s 
cumulative  project  expenditures  to  the  joint  venture  to  be  formed  upon  Doyon’s  election  to 
participate.  Such contribution will be applied to fund 100% of joint venture expenditures until 
exhausted following which each party will be required to contribute its pro rata share of further 
expenditures.
As a consequence of the Company’s determination to focus on its Livengood Project, on October 1, 
2008  the  Company  terminated  the  agreement  with  Doyon  and  wrote  off  the  $1,168,530  in 
associated costs.
(d) South Estelle Project, Alaska
On June 15, 2007, the Company signed a binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with Hidefield Gold Plc. 
of London England. (AIM: HIF) and its partner, Mines Trust Ltd. (a private Alaskan company) 
pursuant to which the Company can earn up to a 80% interest in the South Estelle project located in 
southwest Alaska.  The project consists of 168 State of Alaska unpatented lode mining claims.
Under the LOI the Company can earn up to an aggregate 80% interest in the project as follows:
(cid:127)  the Company can earn an initial 51% interest by making payments of USD 42,000 upon 
TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) acceptance of the transaction (paid) and an additional 
USD 50,000 on or before January 8, 2008 (paid), and incurring aggregate exploration 
expenditures of USD 2,000,000 prior to December 31, 2009;
(cid:127)  the Company can earn an additional 19% interest (aggregate of 70%) by incurring an 
additional USD 3,000,000 in exploration expenditures before December 31, 2011; and,
(cid:127)  the Company can earn an additional 10% interest (aggregate of 80%) by funding all 
expenditures required to prepare and deliver a positive bankable feasibility study.  There 
is no time limit for the delivery of such feasibility study.

(d) South Estelle Project, Alaska (cont’d)
At any time after the Company earns its initial 51% interest, Hidefield/Mines Trust can convert 
their interest into a 1.5% net smelter return royalty.  Following the Company having earned its 
interest, if Hidefield/Mines Trust do not elect to convert to an NSR, the parties will enter into a 
joint venture, in which each will be responsible for its pro rata share of further expenditures.  If the 
interest of either the Company or Hidefield/Mines Trust in such joint venture is reduced to 10% or 
less, such interest will be converted to a 1.5% NSR royalty.
On April 2, 2008, the Company sold its interest in the property to Millrock Resources Inc., a public 
company  listed  on  the  TSXV,  in  consideration  of  the  issuance  of  650,000  common  shares  of 
Millrock to the Company and the grant to the Company of a 1% net smelter return royalty on 
Millrock’s interest in the property.  The Company recognized a gain of $89,246 on the sale.
(e) Properties acquired from AngloGold, Alaska
Pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Sale and Indemnity Agreement dated June 30, 2006, as amended 
on  July  26,  2006,  (the  “AngloGold  Agreement”)  among  the  Company,  AngloGold  Ashanti 
(U.S.A.) Exploration Inc. (“AngloGold”) and Talon Gold Alaska, Inc. (the Company’s wholly 
owned Alaskan subsidiary), the Company acquired all of AngloGold’s interest in a portfolio of 
seven mineral exploration projects in Alaska (then aggregating 246 square kilometres) and referred 
to as the Livengood, Chisna, Gilles, Coffee Dome, West Pogo, Blackshell, and Caribou properties 
(the “Sale Properties”) in consideration of cash payment USD 50,000 on August 4, 2006, and the 
issuance  of  5,997,295  common  shares,  representing  approximately  19.99%  of  the  Company’s 
issued shares following the closing of the acquisition and two private placement financings raising 
an aggregate of $11,479,348.  AngloGold has the right to maintain its percentage equity interest in 
the Company, on an ongoing basis, provided that such right will terminate if AngloGold’s interest 
falls below 10% at any time after January 1, 2009.
As further consideration for the transfer of the Sale Properties, the Company granted to AngloGold 
a 90 day right of first offer with respect to the Sale Properties and any additional mineral properties 
in Alaska in which the Company acquires an interest and which interest the Company proposes to 
farm out or otherwise dispose of.  If AngloGold’s equity interest in the Company is reduced to less 
than 10%, then this right of first offer will terminate.  Details of the Sale Properties are as follows:

The agreement with the University of Alaska is a two stage Exploration Agreement with 
Option to Lease.  The Exploration Agreement has an effective date of January 1, 2007 and 
covers approximately 1,166 hectares of land.  The key terms of the Exploration Agreement 
(and any resulting mining lease) are as follows:
Exploration  Agreement:  In  order  to  maintain  the  option  to  lease  in  good  standing,  the 
Company is required to pay the University USD 117,500 over five years (paid USD 57,500) 
and incur exploration expenditures totalling USD 400,000 over five years (USD 25,000 
commitment  for  the  first  year,  $50,000  for  the  second  year).    If  the  Company  does  not 
terminate  the  option  prior  to  January  1  in  any  option  year,  the  specified  minimum 
expenditures for that year become a commitment of the Company.  The Company is also 
responsible for all taxes and assessments on the lands subject to the option to lease.
Mining Lease: At any time during the option period, the Company has the right to enter into 
a mining lease over some or all of the lands subject to the option.  The mining lease will have 
an initial term of 15 years and for so long thereafter as commercial production continues and 
requires escalating advance royalty payments of USD 30,000 in year 1 to USD 150,000 in 
year  9  and  beyond.    Advance  royalty  payments  are  credited  against  50%  of  production 
royalties.  The Company is also required to incur escalating minimum mandatory exploration 
expenditures of USD 125,000 in year 1 to USD 350,000 in year 5 and beyond and to deliver 
a  feasibility  study  within  10  years  of  the  commencement  of  the  lease.    Upon  the 
commencement of commercial production, the Company is required to pay a sliding scale net 
smelter return royalty of from 3% (USD 300 and below gold) up to 5% (USD 500 and up 
gold).  The Company will also pay a sliding scale net smelter return royalty of from 0.5% 
(USD 450 and below gold) to 1% (USD 450 and above gold) on any federal or Alaska state 
claims staked by the Company or its affiliates within a 2 mile area of interest surrounding the 
University land (not including the Company’s existing leased claims).

(iii)  Blackshell Creek Property
The Blackshell Creek property is located approximately 80 kilometres east of Fairbanks, 
Alaska, and consists of 35 State of Alaska mining claims owned 100% by the Company.  As 
of May 31, 2007 the Company decided to terminate further work on the project and has 
written off its investment in the property totalling $316,233.
(iv)  West Pogo Property
The West Pogo property is located approximately 50 kilometres north of Delta Junction,

owned 100% by the Company.
(vi)  Gilles Property
The Gilles property is located approximately 30 kilometres north of Delta Junction, Alaska, 
and consists of 86 State of Alaska mining claims owned 100% by the Company.  Due to 
disappointing  exploration  results  and  the  Company’s  desire  to  focus  on  its  Livengood 
Project, effective September 1, 2008 the Company abandoned the claims and wrote off the 
associated costs of $449,255.
(vii)  Caribou Property
The  Caribou  property  is  located  approximately  75  kilometres  north  of  Delta  Junction,

expenditures  of  USD$10/acre/year  in  years  1  –  3,  USD20/acre/year  in  years  4  –  6  and 
USD30/acre/year in years 7 – 9 and advance royalty payments of USD5/acre/year in years 1 
-  3,  USD15/acre/year  in  years  4  –  6  and  USD25/acre/year  in  years  7  –  9.    An  NSR 
production royalty of between 2.5% and 5.0% (depending upon the price of gold) is payable 
to the lessor with respect to the lands subject to this lease.
During the year ended May 31, 2007, the Company determined that results to date on the 
Caribou property did not warrant further work, and the lease was terminated and the property 
returned to the lessor.  Accordingly, the related mineral property costs of $126,950 were 
written off.

(f)  Properties optioned from AngloGold, Alaska
In  conjunction  with  the  closing  of  the  acquisition  of  the  Sale  Properties,  the  Company 
entered into an option/joint venture with AngloGold with respect to two additional mineral 
projects  in  Alaska,  referred  to  as  the  LMS  and  the  Terra  properties  (the  “Optioned 
Properties”).
The  Terra  Property  now  consists  of  235  State  of  Alaska  unpatented  lode  mining claims 
(15,552 hectares) held by or on behalf of AngloGold and 5 State of Alaska unpatented lode 
mining claims (324 hectares) leased from an individual.  The lease requires a payment on 
execution  of  USD  25,000  (paid), and advance minimum royalties of USD 25,000 on or

on or before March 22, 2008 (paid), USD 100,000 on or before March 22, 2009 (paid) and 
each  subsequent  March  22  until  March  22,  2015,  and  thereafter  USD  125,000  until  the 
expiry of the lease (all of which are recoverable from production royalties).  The lessor is 
entitled to receive a net smelter returns production royalty on gold equal to 3.0% if the gold 
price is less than USD 450/ounce and 4% if the gold price is USD 450/ounce or higher, plus 
a net smelter returns royalty of 4% on all other mineral products other than gold.  1% of the 
royalty may be purchased for USD 1,000,000 and a further 1% for USD 3,000,000.
The LMS property consists of 92 State of Alaska unpatented lode mining claims (5,691 
hectares) owned by AngloGold.
(i) With respect to the LMS property, the Company will have the right to earn a 60% interest by 
incurring  aggregate  exploration  expenditures  of  USD  3.0  million  by  January  30,  2010 
(incurred), of which the Company has committed to incur minimum exploration expenditures 
of USD 1.0 million during the 2006 calendar year and of USD 750,000 during the 2007 
calendar year.
Upon the Company having earned its 60% interest in the LMS property, AngloGold will 
have  the  right  to  re-acquire  a  20%  interest  (for  an  aggregate  60%  interest)  and  become 
manager  of  the  joint  venture  by  incurring  a  further  USD  4.0  million  in  exploration 
expenditures over a further two years.
(ii) With respect to the Terra property, the Company will have the right to earn a 60% interest by 
incurring aggregate exploration expenditures of USD 3.0 million by January 30, 2010, of 
which  the  Company  has  committed  to  incur  minimum  exploration  expenditures  of  USD 
500,000 during the 2006 calendar year and of USD 750,000 during the 2007 calendar year.  
Upon the Company having earned its 60% interest in the Terra property, AngloGold will 
have  the  right  to  re-acquire  a  20%  interest  (for  an  aggregate  60%  interest)  and  become 
manager  of  the  joint  venture  by  incurring  a  further  USD  4.0  million  in  exploration 
expenditures over a further two years.
In either case, following the parties having earned their final respective interests, each party 
will be required to contribute its pro rata share of further exploration expenditures or be 
diluted.  A party that is diluted to 10% or less will have its interest converted to a 2% net 
smelter return royalty.

(f) Properties optioned from AngloGold, Alaska (cont’d)
On  November  5,  2007  the  Company  provided  notice  to  AngloGold  that  it  has  incurred 
sufficient expenditures to vest its 60% ownership in the Terra project.  AngloGold had 90 
days to decide whether or not to exercise its right to earn back an additional 20% interest in 
the Terra project by incurring USD 4,000,000 in expenditures over the next two years, and 
elected not to do so.  As AngloGold elected not to exercise its back-in right, each party is 
therefore responsible for contribution its share of ongoing joint venture expenditures.
On June 10, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the interest of 
AngloGold in the Terra and LMS projects, plus certain other AngloGold rights on the Gilles 
and West Pogo properties, for the purchase price of $751,500 to be satisfied by the issuance 
of  450,000  shares  of  the  Company  to  AngloGold  (issued  November  24,  2008).    The

can earn an initial 60% interest in each project by making payments and exploration expenditures 
and has the option to earn an additional 10% interest (aggregate 70%) by funding all expenditures 
to take a project to feasibility.  There is no time limit by which a feasibility study is required to be 
delivered.
North Bullfrog: To earn its initial 60% interest, the Company must make total payments of USD 
190,000 and incur total expenditures of USD 4,000,000 over 4 years to March 15, 2011.  The first 
year  requirement  is  a  payment  of  USD  20,000  on  TSXV  acceptance  (paid)  plus  exploration

The  fourth  payment  of USD 50,000 is due by March 15, 2010 and the fifth payment of USD 
50,000 is due by March 15, 2011.
The Company is also required to pay the advance minimum royalty payments to the owners of 
certain  patented  mining  claims  which  are  fully  recoupable  against  production  royalties.    The 
advance minimum royalty in year 1 to 3 is USD 32,300 per year and year 4 onwards is USD

850,000 per 1%.
Painted Hills: To earn its initial 60% interest, the Company must make total payments of USD 
170,000 and incur total expenditures of USD 2,500,000 over 4 years to March 15, 2011.  The first

number of issued shares of the Company at the time of the granting of the options.  Options granted 
under the 2006 Plan will have a maximum term of five years.  The exercise price of options granted 
under the 2006 Plan will not be less than the discounted market price of the common shares (defined as 
the last closing market price of the Company’s common shares immediately preceding the issuance of a 
news  release  announcing  the  granting  of  the  options,  less  the  maximum  discount  permitted  under 
TSXV policies), or such other price as may be agreed to by the Company and accepted by the TSXV.  
Options  granted  under  the  2006  Plan  vest  immediately,  except  for  options  granted  to  consultants 
conducting investor relation activities which will become vested over time with the right to exercise 
one-fourth of the option vesting upon the conclusion of each three month period subsequent to the date 
of the grant of the option, unless otherwise determined by the directors at the date of grant.

Options and stock-based compensation (cont’d)
On  July  16,  2008,  the  Company  amended  the  expiry  dates  and  exercise  prices  of  an  aggregate  of 
3,675,000 outstanding incentive stock options to extend the expiry date for up to eighteen months, such 
that all such options (which were originally granted for a period of two years with expiry dates ranging 
from January 26, 2009 to May 23, 2009) will now expire on July 16, 2010; and to reduce the exercise 
prices (which ranged from $2.70 to $2.95, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.75) to $1.75.  
This amendment was subject to disinterested shareholders’ approval with respect to insiders of the 
Company who hold 2,405,000 of these options (approval received October 21, 2008).  Following this 
approval, additional stock-based compensation charges of $1,688,874 have been included in those 
charges as detailed below.
The Company uses the fair value method for determining stock-based compensation expense for all 
options granted during the fiscal periods.  The fair value of options granted was $2,386,502 (2008- 
$325,063; 2007- $7,077,444), determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the

In addition, the Company has available mineral resource related expenditure pools for Canadian income 
tax purposes totalling approximately $2,628,000 which may be deducted against future taxable income 
in Canada on a discretionary basis.  The Company also has available mineral resource expenses that are 
related to the Company’s exploration activities in the United States of approximately $40,234,000, 
which may be deductible for US tax purposes.  Future tax benefits, which may arise as a result of 
applying these deductions to taxable income, have not been recognized in these accounts due to the 
uncertainty of future taxable income.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (cont’d)
These  amounts  were  unsecured,  non-interest  bearing  and  had  no  fixed  terms  of  repayment.  
Accordingly, fair value could not be readily determined.
The Company has entered into a retainer agreement dated August 1, 2008 with Lawrence W. Talbot 
Law  Corporation  (“LWTLC”),  pursuant  to  which  LWTLC  agrees  to  provide  legal  services  to  the 
Company.  Pursuant to the retainer agreement, the Company has agreed to pay LWTLC a minimum 
annual retainer of $50,000 (plus applicable taxes and disbursements).  The retainer agreement may be 
terminated by LWTLC on reasonable notice, and by the Company on one year’s notice (or payment of 
one year’s retainer in lieu of notice).  An officer of the Company is a director and shareholder of 
LWTLC.
The Company’s purchase of AngloGold’s interest in the Terra, LMS, Gilles and West Pogo Projects in 
Alaska  (Note  6(f))  completed  on  November  24,  2008,  and  the  private  placement  to  AngloGold 
subsequent to May 31, 2009 (see note 13(a)) are considered related party transactions by virtue of a 
common  directorship  and  the  ownership  by  AngloGold  of  in  excess  of  10%  of  the  Company’s 
outstanding common shares.
These transactions with related parties have been valued in these financial statements at the exchange 
amount, which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the related parties.

11.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CANADIAN AND UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (“GAAP”)
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in Canada, which 
differs in certain respects from GAAP in the United States.  The material differences between Canadian 
and United States GAAP, in respect of these financial statements, are as follows:
a) Mineral property exploration and development
Under United States GAAP, all mineral exploration and development property expenditures are 
expensed in the year incurred in an exploration stage company until there is substantial evidence 
that a commercial body of minerals has been located.  Canadian GAAP allows mineral exploration 
and  development  property  expenditures  to  be  deferred  during  this  process.    The  effect  on  the 
Company’s financial statements is summarized below:

Under United States GAAP, the Company would classify the marketable securities as “Securities 
available  for  resale”,  which  is  consistent  with  the  Company’s  change  in  accounting  policy 
described  in  Note  2(o).    The  carrying  value  on  the  balance  sheet  at  May  31,  2009  would  be 
$113,750 (2008 - $247,000, 2007 - $Nil) and the unrealized loss of $133,250 (2008 - $Nil, 2007 - 
$Nil) was recognized in the statements of operations and deficits as other loss.
c) Stock-based compensation
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, and records 
compensation  cost  for  stock-based  employee  compensation  plans  at  fair  value.    Accordingly, 
compensation cost for stock options granted is measured as the fair value at the date of grant, and 
there is no difference in these financial statements.
d) Loss per share
Under both Canadian and United States GAAP basic loss per share is calculated using the weighted 
average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Under United States GAAP, the 
weighted  average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  excludes  any  shares  that  remain  in 
escrow, but may be earned out based on the Company incurring a certain amount of exploration 
and development expenditures.  The weighted average number of shares outstanding under United 
States GAAP for the year ended May 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 45,089,555, 39,193,360 and 
27,101,104 respectively.
e)
Income taxes
Under United States GAAP, the Company would have initially recorded an income tax asset for the 
benefit of the resource deduction pools.  This asset would have been reduced to $Nil by a valuation 
allowance.  The result is no difference in net income reported between Canadian and United States 
GAAP.

12.    CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company manages its capital structure, and makes adjustments to it, based on the funds available 
to the Company, in order to support future business opportunities.  The Board of Directors does not 
establish quantitative return on capital criteria for management, but rather relies on the expertise of the 
Company’s management to sustain future development of the business.
The Company currently has no source of revenues.  As such, the Company is dependent upon external 
financings to fund activities.  In order to carry future projects and pay for administrative costs, the 
Company will spend its existing working capital and raise additional funds as needed.  Management 
reviews its capital management approach on an ongoing basis and believes that this approach, given the 
relative size of the Company, is reasonable.  There were no changes in the Company’s approach to 
capital management during the year ended May 31, 2009.  The Company is not subject to externally 
imposed capital requirements.
13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to May 31, 2009, the Company:
a) As a consequence of the election on July 10, 2009 by AngloGold to exercise its right to maintain its 
13.2907% equity interest in the Company pursuant to the AngloGold Agreement (note 6(e)), the 
Company has agreed to sell to AngloGold, on a private placement basis, an aggregate of 1,218,283 
common shares at a price of $2.68 per share for a gross proceeds of $3,264,998.  AngloGold’s 
equity interest had been diluted by virtue of the Company’s issuance of shares since January 1, 
2009, principally due to the exercise of 7,753,385 warrants, broker options and broker warrants in 
May, 2009.  The placement is expected to close on August 25, 2009.
b) Pursuant to a purchase agreement dated July 30, 2009 among the Company, Talon Gold Nevada 
Inc. (“Talon Nevada”), Redstar and Redstar Gold U.S.A. Inc. (“Redstar US”), Talon Nevada has 
agreed  to purchase all of Redstar’s and Redstar US’s interest in the North Bullfrog Project in 
Nevada (see notes 6(g), (h) and (i)).  The purchase price is $934,000, to be settled by Talon Nevada 
paying Redstar US $250,000 and delivering to Redstar 200,000 common shares of the Company 
(valued,  for  such  purposes,  at  $684,000).    The  Company  has  guaranteed  Talon  Nevada’s 
obligations under the purchase agreement, and will issue the 200,000 common shares to Redstar in 
consideration of the issuance to it by Talon Nevada of shares in the capital stock of Talon Nevada 
having a value of $684,000.  Closing is subject, among other things, to the receipt by each of 
Redstar  and  the  Company  of  the  acceptance  for  filing  of  the  transaction  by  the  TSXV  (both 
received)  and  the  approval  of  the  transaction  by  the  NYSE-Amex  on  behalf  of  the  Company.  
Completion  of  the  acquisition  will  eliminate  the  Company’s  current  vesting  requirements  for 
expenditures, payments and share issuances in order to earn up to a 70% interest in the North 
Bullfrog Project (including the Mayflower and Connection properties).
14.  COMPARATIVE FIGURES
Certain of the comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the consolidated financial 
statement presentation adopted in the current year.
