<p><i> Guided</i> by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> <i>also</i> by the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the

United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the protection of

rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p> <i>Condemning</i> all forms of violence against civilians and deploring the loss of human lives 
in the context of the current situation,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that the Israeli military attacks and operations in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, constitute severe violations of 
international humanitarian law and of the human rights of the Palestinian people therein and 
undermines international efforts towards achieving a just and lasting peace in the region based 
on the two States solution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also </i>that the Israeli siege imposed on the occupied Gaza Strip, including the 
closure of border crossings, leads to disastrous humanitarian, economic, and environmental 
consequences.  
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Demands</i> that the occupying power, Israel, end its occupation of the Palestinian land 
occupied since 1967, and to respect its commitments within the peace process towards the 
establishment of the independent sovereign Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, 
living in peace and security with all its neighbours; </p>
<p> 2.<i> Strongly condemns</i> the Israeli military attacks and operations in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, which have resulted 
in the killing and injury of thousands of Palestinians civilians, including a large number of 
women and children;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying power, Israel, stop the targeting of civilians and the 
systematic destruction of the cultural heritage of the Palestinian people, in addition to the 
destruction of public and private properties, and the targeting of United Nations Facilities, as laid 
down in the Fourth Geneva Convention; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 4. <i>Demands</i> <i>further</i> that Israel, the occupying power, cease immediately all current 
excavations beneath and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and refrain from any act that 
may endanger the structure, or change the nature of the holy sites both Islamic and Christian in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in and around Jerusalem;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> immediate international protection of the Palestinian people in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, in compliance with international human rights and humanitarian 
law both applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also calls</i> for the immediate cessation of all Israeli military attacks and operations 
throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the firing of crude rockets by Palestinian 
combatants against southern Israel;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying power, Israel, immediately stop its illegal decision to 
demolish a large number of Palestinian houses in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of al-Bustan 
in the Selwan area, near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which will be resulting in the displacement of 
more than 1,500 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Demands </i>that the occupying power, Israel, release Palestinian prisoners and 
detainees;  
</p>
