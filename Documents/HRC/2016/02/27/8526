<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the past, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances carried 
out analysis that led to the conclusion that few States had codified enforced disappearance 
as a separate criminal offence under domestic law. As the Working Group always 
considered this issue of the utmost importance and, given that article 4 of the United 
Nations Declaration for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (&#8220;the 
Declaration&#8221;)1 requires that States treat all acts of enforced disappearance as offences under 
criminal law, the Working Group decided to draft a study on the criminal law treatment of 
enforced disappearances in States around the world.  
</p>
<p>2. Based on this decision, a first questionnaire was submitted to States through a note 
verbale by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 22 March 
</p><p>2005. A few States responded, which only allowed the Working Group to come up with 
limited conclusions. 
</p>
<p>3. In 2008, the Working Group decided to renew its request. Based on this decision, on 
18 December 2009, OHCHR sent a note verbale to all States requesting their views on the 
subject and submitting a list of questions.  
</p>
<p>4. In resolution 14/10 of 18 June 2010 entitled &#8220;Enforced or involuntary 
disappearances&#8221;, the Human Rights Council requested the Working Group to prepare a 
report for submission to the Human Rights Council at its sixteenth session on best practices 
on enforced disappearances in domestic criminal legislation, based on inputs solicited from 
Member States.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report is submitted pursuant to the above-mentioned resolution and aims 
at highlighting best practices in the matter of the criminal treatment of enforced 
disappearance and at formulating recommendations to assist States in enhancing existing 
legislation, and developing new legislation on enforced disappearance. The Working Group 
would like to express its deepest gratitude to those States that responded to the 
questionnaire and for the detailed information provided therein.2  
</p>
<p>6. From the answers received, the Working Group found that States have made 
significant progress between 2005 and 2010 in the enactment of legislation to address 
enforced disappearance. Numerous examples of best practices can be drawn from these 
national experiences and be used by those States which intend to enact new legislation or to 
revise their current legislation in the near future. 
</p>
<p>7. Before concentrating on those practices in the field of criminal law, the Working 
Group would like to congratulate those States where the non-derogable right of all persons

</p>

Korea, Ukraine and Yemen. The following States have provided responses to the second 
questionnaire (2009): Argentina, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon,

and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). The full texts of the submissions are available from the 
Secretariat. </p>

</p>
<p>not to be subjected to enforced disappearance is embodied in the Constitution.3 Although 
not directly touching upon the issue of the criminal sanction of enforced disappearance, the 
Working Group deems it important that this right be fully recognized as a human right at 
the level of the Constitution, as it makes it clear that this right should be respected by all 
institutions of the State in all their activities. 
</p>
<p>8. The questionnaire sent by the Working Group covered six areas: the codification of 
the crime of enforced disappearances in domestic law (part I); the definition of the 
constitutive elements of the crime (part II); the continuous nature of the offence and its 
consequences in criminal law (part III); the modes of participation to the crime of enforced 
disappearance (part IV); applicable sanctions (part V); and the guarantees against impunity 
of perpetrators (part VI). 
</p>
<p><b> II.  The codification of the crime of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>9. Article 4 of the Declaration provides that &#8220;all acts of enforced disappearance shall be 
offences under criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties which shall take into 
account their extreme seriousness&#8221;.  In 1995, the Working Group adopted a general 
comment on this provision, noting that the obligation to codify enforced disappearance as a 
separate offence in domestic criminal codes &#8220;applies to all States regardless of whether acts 
of enforced disappearance actually take place or not. It is not sufficient for Governments to 
refer to previously existing criminal offences relating to enforced deprivation of liberty, 
torture, intimidation, excessive violence, etc. In order to comply with article 4 of the 
Declaration, the very act of enforced disappearance as stipulated in the Declaration must be 
made a separate criminal offence&#8221;.4 The same concept was reiterated by the Working 
Group on a number of occasions. 
</p>
<p>10. Even if the absence of an autonomous crime does not excuse States from 
investigating and punishing acts of enforced disappearances, the obligation to criminalize 
enforced disappearance under national legislation as a separate offence is a powerful 
mechanism for overcoming impunity. The Supreme Court of Nepal found that &#8220;in the 
absence of pertinent laws, no real, effective or practical investigation can be carried out. &#8230; 
For the purpose of addressing this problem effectively, it is necessary to urgently enact a 
law which includes provisions that the act of disappearance is a criminal offence, defining 
the act of disappearance pursuant to the definition stated in the International Convention&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>11. A number of States admit that they have not yet incorporated the crime of enforced 
disappearance into their domestic legislation, but argue that their legislation provides for 
safeguards from various offences that are linked with enforced disappearance or are closely 
related to it, such as abduction, kidnapping, unlawful detention, illegal deprivation of 
liberty, trafficking, illegal constraint and abuse of power. However, a plurality of 
fragmented offences does not mirror the complexity and the particularly serious nature of 
enforced disappearance. While the mentioned offences may form part of a type of enforced 
disappearance, none of them are sufficient to cover all the elements of enforced 
disappearance, and often they do not provide for sanctions that would take into account the 
particular gravity of the crime, therefore falling short for guaranteeing a comprehensive 
protection.

<p>12. The analysis of the responses given by States shows great progress made in a few 
years. In most of the cases, the impulse for codifying the crime of enforced disappearance 
seems to have been the ratification and thus the implementation of the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) in domestic law. At the same time, a number of States 
have also simultaneously or alternatively codified enforced disappearance as an 
autonomous crime in their domestic legislation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The codification of enforced disappearance in conformity with the 
Statute of the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>13. A significant number (45) of States analysed6 have indeed criminalized enforced 
disappearance as a crime against humanity, when it is committed as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack, 
following the definition given of crimes against humanity and of enforced disappearance 
provided for in article 7 of the Rome Statute. The Working Group welcomes those positive 
developments that make the crime of enforced disappearance specifically punishable under 
certain domestic laws. 
</p>
<p>14. During its recent mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina &#8211; one of those States that 
codified enforced disappearances pursuant to the Rome Statute &#8211; the Working Group was 
pleased to learn that a number of convictions had occurred on the basis of this crime. Those 
convictions positively succeed in grasping the specificity of those acts, which cannot be 
described satisfactorily with other qualifications such as &#8220;murder&#8221; or &#8220;torture&#8221;. Thus, the 
Working Group encourages more States to ratify the Rome Statute and to transpose the

</p>
<p>crimes of the ICC Statute into domestic law, including the crime of enforced disappearance 
as a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p>15. However, the Working Group would like to reiterate the reservations it has already 
expressed (see its general comment on the definition of enforced disappearances)7 on the 
specific definition of enforced disappearances resulting from the Rome Statute. In this 
regard, the Working Group  recommends that the definition of enforced disappearance 
provided for by the Rome Statute be interpreted by the national authorities in line with the 
more adequate definition provided for in article 2 of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Codification of enforced disappearance as an autonomous crime 
</b></p>
<p>16. Experience shows that enforced disappearances often do not occur as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack against civilians. In this perspective, criminalizing 
enforced disappearance in domestic law only when committed in this specific context 
implies that many acts of enforced disappearances remain outside the scope of domestic 
criminal law and the jurisdiction of national courts. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group has pointed out that &#8220;since most cases of enforced 
disappearance occur in isolation and not necessarily as part of a systematic attack with the 
intention to remove the victims from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of 
time &#8230; efforts have to be increased to include enforced disappearance in all domestic 
criminal codes with appropriate punishment, and to bring the perpetrators to justice before 
domestic courts under national as well as universal jurisdiction&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>18. Even if it cannot lead to invoking the jurisdiction of the International Criminal 
Court, an isolated act of enforced disappearance nonetheless remains an international crime 
and a gross human rights violation, which determines the criminal responsibility of the 
perpetrators, as required by several international human rights treaties. It follows that States 
cannot limit the criminalization of enforced disappearances only to those instances which 
would amount to crimes against humanity in the sense of the ICC Statute, but should 
encompass in the definition of the offence any kind of such act.  
</p>
<p>19. A number of good practices can be seen in this regard. Two States have thus 
established in their domestic legislation two separate offences: one in the context of article 
7 of the ICC Statute and, another, punishing enforced disappearances that do not take place 
in a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population.9 Other States, however, 
have a single offence in their domestic law, which is sufficiently broad to include any 
instance of this crime, be it committed as an isolated act or as part of a widespread or 
systematic attack against a civilian population.10 Some of those States have chosen to

 9 Panama (arts. 150 and 432 Criminal Code); Uruguay (arts. 18 and 21 Law No. 18.026 of 4 October 
</p>
<p>2006). In the case of Uruguay, enforced disappearance as an autonomous offence (not in the context 
of article 7 of the ICC Statute), is nevertheless qualified as a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p> 10 Armenia (art. 392 Criminal Code); Bolivia (art. 292-bis Criminal Code), Colombia (art. 165 Criminal 
Code), El Salvador (art. 364 Criminal Code), Guatemala (art. 201-ter Criminal Code), Mexico (art. 
215-A Criminal Code), Nicaragua (art. 488 Criminal Code), Paraguay (art. 236 Criminal Code), Peru 
(art. 320 Criminal Code), Uruguay (art. 21 Law 18.026 of 4 October 2006), and Venezuela (art. 180-
A Criminal Code). </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>qualify enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity, even if it is not committed in 
the context of a widespread or systematic attack.11 
</p>
<p>20. All those form distinct practices which are in conformity with article 4 of the 
Declaration and thus should be followed by States that are contemplating the adoption of 
legislation concerning enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The constitutive elements of the offence 
</b></p>
<p>21. Since 1995, the Working Group has clarified that States are not bound to strictly 
follow the definition of the offence as contained in the Declaration, ensuring however &#8220;that 
the act of enforced disappearance is defined in a way which clearly distinguishes it from 
related offences such as enforced deprivation of liberty, abduction, kidnapping, 
incommunicado detention, etc. The following three cumulative minimum elements should 
be contained in any definition: (a) Deprivation of liberty against the will of the person 
concerned; (b) Involvement of government officials, at least indirectly by acquiescence; (c) 
Refusal to disclose the fate and whereabouts of the person concerned&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p><b> A.  The deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>22. Every enforced disappearance starts with the deprivation of liberty of the victim. 
The Working Group pointed out that &#8220;under the definition of enforced disappearance 
contained in the Declaration, the criminal offence in question starts with an arrest, detention 
or abduction against the will of the victim, which means that the enforced disappearance 
may be initiated by an illegal detention or an initially legal arrest or detention. That is to 
say, the protection of a victim from enforced disappearance must be effective upon the act 
of deprivation of liberty, whatever form such deprivation of liberty takes, and not be limited 
to cases of illegitimate deprivations of liberty&#8221;.13  
</p>
<p>23. Thus the definition of the crime in domestic law should cover all the varieties of 
situations covered by the generic term of &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221;. For instance, using the 
term &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; alone is inappropriate, as it refers only to a certain type of illegal 
abduction. 
</p>
<p>24. Good practices can be identified in laws that simply use the term &#8220;deprivation of 
liberty of the victim&#8221;14 or &#8220;deprivation of liberty in whatever form&#8221;15 &#8211; which is even better. 
The terms &#8220;legally or illegally detain a person&#8221; can fit, provided they are interpreted 
broadly so as to cover all forms of deprivation of liberty in any place, and not only in 
official detention centres by competent authorities (although acting illegally).16 Definitions 
inspired from the Rome Statute use the same wording as article 7, paragraph 2-i, that is to 
say, &#8220;the arrest, detention or abduction of persons&#8221;, which should be interpreted as 
sufficiently broad to cover all types of deprivation of liberty.

</p>
<p><b> B.  The perpetrators of the offence 
</b></p>
<p>25. In its general comment on the definition of enforced disappearance, the Working 
Group recalled that &#8220;with respect to the perpetrators of the crime, (&#8230;) for purposes of its 
work, enforced disappearances are only considered as such when the act in question is 
perpetrated by State actors or by private individuals or organized groups (e.g. paramilitary 
groups) acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence 
of the Government&#8221;.17 Where domestic criminal legislation did not include acts committed 
by individuals acting on behalf of the Government or with its direct or indirect support, 
without necessarily having received orders or instructions from Government agents to 
commit the offence, the Working Group found that the definition was partial and, as such, 
needed to be amended.18 The Working Group also noted that it &#8220;concurs with the provisions 
of article 3 of the International Convention, in connection with the fact that States shall take 
appropriate measures to investigate acts comparable to enforced disappearances committed 
by persons or groups of persons acting without the authorization, support or acquiescence 
of the State and to bring those responsible to justice&#8221;.19  
</p>
<p>26. Good practices therefore flow from the implementation of the Rome Statute, which 
contemplates the repression of enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity when 
committed &#8220;by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political 
organization&#8221;, a wording which covers the broadest spectrum of instances of enforced 
disappearances. The same can be said of the definition of enforced disappearance as an 
autonomous offence which foresees the perpetration of the crime by &#8220;any individual&#8221;.20 The 
Working Group however recalls that such broad definitions shall not be construed to dilute 
the responsibility of the State and should take into account the specificity of the offence of 
enforced disappearance that result from the other constitutive elements, and in particular the 
fact that such a crime results in placing the victim outside the protection of the law. 
</p>
<p>27. Equally positive and more in line with the language of the Declaration are the 
domestic laws restricting the category of potential perpetrators to those persons who have a 
link &#8211; whatever nature &#8211; with the State, following for instance the wording used in article 2 
of the International Convention.21 
</p>
<p><b> C.  The refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or the 
concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person 
</b></p>
<p>28. According to definitions of enforced disappearance in international law, one of the 
constitutive elements of the offence is the refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty 
of the victim, or the concealment of his or her fate or whereabouts. This element in fact 
distinguishes enforced disappearance from other offences, such as arbitrary detention.22 
Good practices of States include the codification of enforced disappearance following the 
definition given by the Rome Statute (&#8220;the arrest, detention or abduction of persons&#8230; 
<i>followed by</i> a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on

<p>the fate or whereabouts of those persons&#8221;), as well as the codification of an autonomous 
offence including such an element in its definition.23 Other wordings are equally 
acceptable, provided they are interpreted as covering all the cases contemplated in the 
Declaration, the International Convention and the Rome Statute, that is to say: refusal to 
acknowledge the deprivation of liberty; refusal to give information on/concealment of the 
fate or the whereabouts of the person.24  
</p>
<p><b> D. The placement of the disappeared person outside the protection of the 
law and the intent of the perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>29. All definitions of enforced disappearance in international law indicate that the victim 
is placed outside the protection of the law. This peculiarity of enforced disappearance 
entails the suspension of the enjoyment of all other human rights and freedoms of the 
victim and places him or her in a situation of complete defencelessness. This is strictly 
related to the right of everyone to be recognized as a person before the law, which is a pre-
requisite to enjoy all other human rights.  
</p>
<p>30. Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Declaration provides that any act of enforced 
disappearance <i>has the consequence</i> of placing the persons subjected thereto outside the 
protection of the law. 
</p>
<p>31. With the aim of construing the definition of the offence in a way that is most 
conducive to the protection from enforced disappearance, the Working Group &#8220;admits cases 
of enforced disappearance without requiring that the information whereby a case is reported 
by a source should demonstrate, or even presume, the intention of the perpetrator to place 
the victim outside the protection of the law&#8221;.25  
</p>
<p>32. Good practices come from those States that include this element of &#8220;placement of 
the victim outside the protection of the law&#8221; as a <i>consequence</i> of the other constitutive 
elements, in conformity with the Declaration and the position of the Working Group.26  
</p>
<p><b> IV.  The continuous nature of the offence and its consequences in 
criminal law 
</b></p>
<p>33. Article 17.1 of the Declaration establishes that &#8220;acts constituting enforced 
disappearance shall be considered a continuous offence as long as the perpetrators continue 
to conceal the fate and the whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts 
remain unclarified&#8221;. In its general comment on enforced disappearance as a continuous 
crime, the Working Group pointed out that &#8220;enforced disappearances are prototypical 
continuous acts. The act begins at the time of the abduction and extends for the whole time 
that the crime is not complete, that is to say until the State acknowledges the detention or 
releases information pertaining to the fate or whereabouts of the individual&#8221;.

<p>34. Responses to the questionnaire sent by the Working Group reveal best practices in 
this matter. In particular, some States expressly define enforced disappearance as a 
continuous offence under their criminal law.27 This explicit characterization of the offence 
as continuous has facilitated domestic tribunals in convicting the accused for enforced 
disappearance in cases where the commission of the act had began before the offence was 
codified under domestic law.28 In other cases, although the offence is not expressly 
qualified as continuous, domestic tribunals have equally upheld this notion with regard to 
enforced disappearance and the application of the principle of non-retroactivity.29 Other 
States where enforced disappearance is not codified as a separate offence nonetheless 
recognize the notion of continuous crime,30 which might facilitate its application to acts of 
enforced disappearances. In one State, the offence of enforced disappearance is codified, 
but the case law has not yet applied to it the notion of &#8220;permanent&#8221; crime, even though 
other offences related to the violation of personal liberty, such as abduction, have been 
qualified as permanent.31 
</p>
<p><b> V. Participation in the commission of enforced disappearance 
and inchoate offences 
</b></p>
<p>35. The different forms of participation in the commission of enforced disappearance, 
such as complicity, command responsibility or instructions, instigation, consent, 
acquiescence and active concealment, shall also be punishable under domestic criminal law. 
This is important notably as regards the criminal responsibility of persons involved in the 
</p>
<p>  
 27 Guatemala; Uruguay; and Venezuela. Nicaragua answered that the notion of continuous crime is 
</p>
<p>known under Nicaraguan legislation (art. 83 Criminal Code) and enforced disappearance is 
considered as such.

<p>chain of command. Usually many perpetrators are implicated in the commission of an 
enforced disappearance and not necessarily all of them are aware of the whereabouts or the 
fate of the victim.32  
</p>
<p>36. Although the Declaration does not contain a detailed provision on this matter, article 
6, paragraph 1, of the International Convention provides that States shall take the necessary 
measures to hold criminally responsible at least &#8220;a) any person who commits, orders, 
solicits or induces the commission of, attempts to commit, is an accomplice to or 
participates in an enforced disappearance; b) a superior who: (i) knew, or consciously 
disregarded information which clearly indicated, that subordinates under his or her effective 
authority and control were committing or about to commit a crime of enforced 
disappearance; (ii) exercised effective responsibility for and control over activities which 
were concerned with the crime of enforced disappearance; and (iii) failed to take all 
necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to prevent or repress the 
commission of an enforced disappearance or to submit the matter to the competent 
authorities for investigation or prosecution&#8221;.33  
</p>
<p>37. Good practices from a great number of States result from the implementation of the 
Rome Statute in their domestic legislation and in particular of articles 25 and 28 of this 
Statute, which provide for a detailed account of forms of responsibility, comparable to the 
one that can be found in article 6 of the International Convention.34 However, this only 
concerns responsibility of persons having committed the crime of enforced disappearance 
as a crime against humanity, under the condition and the specific definition given in article 
7 of the Statute.35

<p>11: &#8220;The Supreme Court of Justice of Peru declared that &#8220;the duty to provide information is crucial 
for the codification of the offence. [&#8230;] As long as the situation of disappearance lasts, all those

to provide information. To be held criminally responsible, it is not necessary that perpetrators or 
participants intervene since the very beginning of the commission of the offence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 33 Art. 6, 1(c) of the International Convention establishes that: &#8220;subparagraph (b) above is without 
prejudice to the higher standards of responsibility applicable under relevant international law to a 
military commander or to a person effectively acting as a military commander&#8221;.

<p> 35 In Uruguay, enforced disappearances are always crimes against humanity even when not perpetrated 
under the conditions set by the Rome Statute. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>38. When it comes to enforced disappearance as an autonomous crime, one State 
establishes a comprehensive regime specifically dealing with those who solicit or induce 
the commission of, attempt to commit, are accomplice to, or participate in an enforced 
disappearance.36 Another State more generally provides for the responsibility of &#8220;those who 
participate or conceal the offence&#8221;.37 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Sanctions  
</b></p>
<p>39. Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Declaration states that: &#8220;All acts of enforced 
disappearance shall be offences under criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties 
which shall take into account their extreme seriousness&#8221;.38 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group found that a penalty of 25 to 40 years of imprisonment for the 
offence of enforced disappearance is consistent with the Declaration.39 Good practices in 
this regard can be found in a limited number of States.40 
</p>
<p>41. In some States, the penalty provided for by domestic legislation does not seem 
appropriate at first sight when applied to enforced disappearance as an autonomous offence, 
even though in certain cases, a very broad choice is let to the appreciation of the judge or 
the jury pronouncing the sentence, including through the consideration of possible 
aggravating circumstances.41 Penalties contemplated to punish enforced disappearance as a 
crime against humanity as defined by the Rome Statute are generally more appropriate, 
although it is not always the case. However, the Working Group deems that if enforced 
disappearance as a crime against humanity is abhorrent, enforced disappearance as a single 
act is still a very serious crime that deserves a correspondingly severe sentence. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Declaration states: &#8220;Mitigating circumstances may be 
established in national legislation for persons who, having participated in enforced 
disappearances, are instrumental in bringing the victims forward alive or in providing 
voluntarily information which would contribute to clarifying cases of enforced 
disappearance&#8221;.42 
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group found that the criminal legislation that &#8220;provides for mitigating 
measures only in the case that the perpetrators cooperate in the liberation of the victim or in 
the finding of the remains of the victim, as the case may be&#8221; meets the requirements of 
article 4, paragraph 2, of the Declaration.43 
</p>
<p>44. A number of States establish specific aggravating or mitigating circumstances for 
enforced disappearance,44 while others refer to the generic circumstances, if any, 
</p>
<p>  
 36 Colombia (art. 340, 348, 441, 446, 449 and 450 Criminal Code). 
 37 Venezuela (art. 180-A Criminal Code). 
 38 Similarly, see article 7 of the International Convention. 
 39 A/HRC/4/41/Add.1, para. 33. See also E/CN.4/2006/56/Add.1,  para. 27. 
 40 Colombia (320/540 months of prison and up to 480/600 months in case of aggravating circumstances, 
</p>
<p>plus pecuniary sanction, plus disqualification from public offices for 160/360 months); Guatemala 
(25/40 years of prison, but also the death penalty: see below). 
</p>
<p> 41 Bolivia (5 to 15 years of prison and up to 30 years in case of aggravating circumstances); Peru (&#8220;no 
less than 15 years of prison&#8221; and disqualification from office of public servants); Uruguay (2 to 25 
years).

 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>established in the Criminal Code. When specific aggravating circumstances are provided 
for, they relate, among others, to the event of the death or of serious physical or 
psychological harm to the disappeared person, the fact that the victim is a member of a 
particularly vulnerable group, the fact that the perpetrator is a public official, or the fact that 
the act considered is a continuous crime.45 In some other States, the commission of a crime 
over a longer period of time is considered as an aggravating circumstance.46 As regards 
mitigating circumstances, they include, among others, the fact that the victim is freed 
within a given lapse of time or the fact that the person implicated provides information 
which makes it possible to clarify the case or to identify the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>45. As regards accessory sanctions, the Working Group held that domestic legislation 
dealing with enforced disappearance shall provide that perpetrators must suffer 
administrative disqualification.47 Accordingly, some States expressly provide for 
disqualification from office for public servants convicted of enforced disappearance.48  
</p>
<p>46. The obligation to provide for appropriate criminal sanctions shall not detract from 
the duty to ensure that full civil reparation is granted to the victims. The Working Group 
recalled that &#8220;in addition to the applicable criminal penalties, the alleged perpetrators of 
enforced disappearance bear general civil liability&#8221;.49 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Guarantees against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>47. In its 1994 report (E/CN.4/1994/26), the Working Group specifically referred to the 
question of impunity, reminding States of their obligations not to make or enact laws that 
would in effect give immunity to perpetrators of disappearances. Subsequent reports have 
repeated this concern. There exists a vicious circle between the commission of enforced 
disappearance and impunity. As noted by the Working Group and the Commission on 
Human Rights, impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced 
disappearance and one of the major obstacles to the elucidation of the cases thereof.50 In 
this regard, the Working Group notes a number of good practices from States that 
progressively contributed to put an end to a situation of impunity on their territory.   
</p>
<p><b> A.  Amnesty 
</b></p>
<p>48. Article 18 of the Declaration provides that &#8220;persons who have or are alleged to have 
committed an enforced disappearance shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or 
similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal 
</p>
<p>  
Uruguay (arts. 15 and 21.3 Law No. 18.026 of 4 October 2006), and Venezuela (art. 180-A Criminal 
Code).  
</p>
<p> 45 E.g. Nicaragua (art. 83 Criminal Code). 
 46 E.g. Czech Republic (Sect. 42.m of the Criminal Code). 
 47 A/HRC/7/2/Add.1, paras. 39 and 66.c). Article 5 of the Declaration establishes that, without prejudice 
</p>
<p>to the international responsibility of the State concerned in accordance with the principles of 
international law, in addition to such criminal penalties as are applicable, enforced disappearance 
render their perpetrators and the State or State authorities which organize, acquiesce in or tolerate 
such disappearances liable under civil law.

<p>proceedings or sanction&#8221;.51 The Working Group issued a thorough interpretation of this 
provision in its general comment on article 18 of the Declaration.52 It detailed those cases 
where an amnesty would be deemed contrary to article 18 and gave examples of &#8220;similar 
measures&#8221; which should also be prohibited. It also stated that &#8220;article 18 of the Declaration, 
when construed together with other provisions of the Declaration, allows limited and 
exceptional measures that directly lead to the prevention and termination of disappearances, 
as provided for in article 3 of the Declaration, even if, prima facie, these measures could 
appear to have the effect of an amnesty law or similar measure that might result in 
impunity&#8221; &#8211; and gave a detailed account of the types of measures that could be taken (see in 
particular paragraph 8 of the general comment). 
</p>
<p>49. The best practices emanate from States that expressly exclude the crime of enforced 
disappearance from the application of amnesty laws or similar measures, wherever the act 
is qualified as a crime against humanity or not.53 Some other States limit the exclusion to 
disappearances which fall under the definition of crimes against humanity.54 Again, the 
Working Group would like to underline that whereas enforced disappearance as a crime 
against humanity is abhorrent, enforced disappearance as a single act is still a very serious 
crime and should be as such excluded from any measure of amnesty that would not respect 
the conditions set by the Working Group in its general comment on article 18. 
</p>
<p>50. In some States, there exists no restriction at all that would prevent the granting of an 
amnesty for acts of enforced disappearances.55 The Working Group would like to 
recommend those States to follow the best practices by the States mentioned above, by 
excluding disappearances from the application of amnesty laws or similar measures.56 In 
any event, those States should refrain from adopting any amnesty law or similar measure 
that would not respect the conditions detailed by the Working Group in its general 
comment on article 18. 
</p>
<p>51. In a number of other States, previous amnesty laws or similar measures have been 
reviewed, limited in their scope of application or even declared illegal <i>ex post facto</i>, thus 
allowing the opening or reopening of judgements over crimes committed in the past, 
including still unsolved cases of enforced disappearances.57

2006), and Venezuela (arts. 180-A Criminal Code and 29 Constitution). In Guatemala, the amnesty 
law itself does exclude enforced disappearance from its scope (art. 8 Decree145-1996 Law of 
National Reconciliation, 1996).

<p> 55 Bosnia and Herzegovina; Czech Republic; Eritrea; Slovenia. 
 56 Estonia clarified its position that no amnesty would be applied to enforced disappearances, despite the 
</p>
<p>fact that no explicit provision provides for such an exclusion. 
 57 In Argentina, in 2003, the Parliament declared null and void the two mentioned amnesty laws and on 
</p>
<p>14 June 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice declared them unconstitutional, thus concretely allowing 
the opening or re-opening of judgments over the crimes committed by the military in the Seventies, 
including thousands of cases of enforced disappearances (Reference is made to Supreme Court of 
Justice, Case S.1767.XXXVIII, Sim&#243;n, Julio H&#233;ctor y otros s/ privaci&#243;n ileg&#237;tima de la libertad, etc., 
judgment of 14 June 2005.) On 13 July 2007, the Supreme Court adopted a decision whereby it 
declared ineffective the pardon of 1990 in one specific case, establishing a significant precedent. 
Reference is made to Supreme Court of Justice, Case Santiago Omar Riveros, judgment of 13 July 
</p><p>2007. In Chile, the Supreme Court adopted a series of decisions excluding the application of the

<p><b> B. Due obedience to superior orders 
</b></p>
<p>52. All international human rights instruments dealing with enforced disappearance 
make it clear that no order or instruction from any public authority, civilian, military or 
other, may be invoked to justify an offence of enforced disappearance.58 The Working 
Group stressed that this principle shall be duly mirrored by domestic legislation.59 None of 
the mentioned international instruments refers to the fact that superior orders could be 
considered a ground for mitigation of punishment if justice so requires. Indeed, even if 
national legislation were to introduce mitigation of sentence based on superior orders, 
mitigation could not be without limits: if too great a reduction of penalty were permitted by 
national law, it would contravene the obligation to provide for &#8220;appropriate penalties&#8221; 
contained, among others, in article 4 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>53. According to the responses received by the Working Group, it appears that a number 
of States already include in their domestic legislation provisions that expressly state that no 
order or instruction may be invoked to justify an enforced disappearance, in most of the 
cases when this act receives the qualification of crime against humanity.60 In other States, 
acting pursuant to an order normally excludes responsibility, unless the order was 
&#8220;manifestly unlawful&#8221;61 or out of the limits of the superior&#8217;s powers,62 or the subordinate 
</p>
<p>  
Amnesty Decree-Law of 1978 to crimes against humanity. The Supreme Court also decided that the 
doctrine of &#8220;continuing offence of kidnapping&#8221; should prevent any application of amnesty or 
prescription to cases of enforced disappearances. In El Salvador, in a judgement of 26 September 
2000, the Supreme Court of Justice affirmed that the Decree of 20 March 1993 granting amnesty to 
all those who participated in crimes prior to 1 January 1992 could not be declared unconstitutional, 
but that judges had the faculty of avoiding its application in specific cases, which happened once, in a 
case of extrajudicial executions (See the Working Group&#8217;s report on El Salvador, para. 64.) In this 
case, however, the Working Group has urged the Legislative Assembly to amend the Decree in order 
to bring it into line with the points made in paragraph 8 of the Working Group&#8217;s General Comment on 
Article 18 of the Declaration (see A/HRC/7/2/Add.2, par. 90.) In Iraq, article 15, par. 6 of the Law of 
the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Code establishes that amnesty decrees prior to the coming into force of

<p> 58 See art. 6 of the Declaration; art. VIII of the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of 
Persons; and arts. 6.2 and 23.2 of the International Convention. All mentioned provisions also 
establish that States shall ensure that orders or instructions prescribing, authorizing or encouraging 
enforced disappearance are prohibited; and that a person who refuses to obey such an order will not 
be punished. On this subject see also art. 33 of the Rome Statute.

<p>would commit a criminal act by carrying out the order.63 With regard to these States, the 
Working Group suggests that it should be specified, either by way of judicial interpretation 
or legislative amendment, that the order to commit or to participate in any way in the crime 
of enforced disappearance is &#8220;manifestly unlawful&#8221; or criminal. 
</p>
<p>54. Finally, some other States still retain the principle according to which obeying an 
order is an exempting circumstance for the subordinate. The Working Group recommends 
those States to amend their legislation on this issue and to put in line with international law, 
following the good practices of other States. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Statute of limitations 
</b></p>
<p>55. The qualification of any instance of enforced disappearance as not being subjected 
to statute of limitations is a concrete guarantee against impunity. This must always be 
recognized when the offence is committed in a context in which it becomes a crime against 
humanity. In other cases, if States decide to enact statutes of limitations, it must be made 
clear by domestic legislation that these terms shall not start for as long as the fate or 
whereabouts of the victims remain unclarified. 
</p>
<p>56. Best practices emanate from States that have established that enforced 
disappearances are not subjected to statute of limitations.64 In other States, it is established 
that crimes against humanity in general are not subjected to statute of limitations,65 which 
in most of the cases &#8211; in particular when the crime against humanity is the result of the 
implementation of the Rome Statute - includes enforced disappearances. Some other States 
informed that they subject crimes, including in some cases enforced disappearances, to 
statute of limitations.66 A good practice though, is set by those States which, among them,

99 Criminal Code for sanctions); Nicaragua (art. 131 Criminal Code); Panama (art. 120 Criminal 
Code); Paraguay (art. 5 Constitution and art. 102 Criminal Code), Uruguay (art. 7 Law No. 18.026 of 
4 October 2006); Venezuela (arts. 180-A Criminal Code and 29 Constitution).

</b></p>
<p>interpreted the statute of limitations in combination with the principle according to which 
enforced disappearance is to be considered as a continuous crime, thus admitting that the 
statute of limitations runs from the moment when the offence ceases.67 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Competent tribunal to judge enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Working Group has pointed out that the codification of enforced disappearances 
as offences under criminal law, &#8220;refers to the relevant domestic criminal codes that are to 
be enforced by competent ordinary courts, i.e. neither by any special tribunal, in particular 
military courts (article 16, par. 2 of the Declaration), nor by administrative agencies or 
tribunals&#8221;.68It reiterated that domestic legislation shall &#8220;stipulate that those responsible for 
the offence of enforced disappearance shall be tried only by the competent ordinary courts, 
in each State, and not by any other special tribunal, in particular military courts&#8221;.69  
</p>
<p>58. Some States expressly establish in domestic legislation that enforced disappearance 
can never be considered as an in-service offence and that military courts have no 
jurisdiction on enforced disappearance.70 Other States affirmed that enforced disappearance 
could only be tried by competent ordinary courts.71 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Universal jurisdiction and aut dedere, aut judicare 
</b></p>
<p>59. As a crucial guarantee against impunity, domestic legislation shall provide for the 
application in cases of enforced disappearance of the principle of universal jurisdiction, in 
addition to or in combination with that of <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>. This allows States to 
bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for enforced disappearance who are found 
on their territory.  
</p>
<p>60. A number of States reported to have domestic provisions that allow for the 
application of the principles of universal jurisdiction and/or <i>aut dedere aut judicare.72</i> In 
</p>
<p>  
282 and 309 Criminal Code); Eritrea (3 to 25 years depending on the sanction envisaged for the 
offence concerned, art. 225-238 Transitional Penal Code); Estonia (5 to 10 years, but crimes against 
humanity are not subjected to statute of limitations, see above); Kazakhstan (2 to 20 years, but crimes 
against the security of mankind are excepted, see above); Madagascar (for punishment, 20 years in 
case of criminal offences; for criminal proceedings, 1 to 10 years depending on the sanction 
contemplated for the offence concerned); Moldova (2 to 25 years, art. 60 Criminal Code, but crimes 
against peace and security of mankind are not covered, see above); Poland (30 years for homicide and 
20 years for other crimes); Qatar (3 to 10 years, depending on the offence); Togo (10 years). 
</p>
<p> 67 Belgium; Lebanon has no specific crime of enforced disappearance but states that enforced 
disappearance would be regarded as a continuous offence if codified, and accordingly the statute of 
limitation would begin on the date on which the deprivation of liberty comes to an end, i.e. when the 
abducted person recovers his personal liberty; Thailand has no specific crime of enforced 
disappearance either but it stated that offences relating to detaining, confining or depriving of liberty 
of a person are regarded as continuous crimes and the prescription shall be activated as from the date 
of the end of such offences; Poland.

</p>
<p> 71 Paraguay; Peru.

</p>
<p>some States, <i>aut dedere aut judicare </i>is recognized for at least some international crimes, 
but not the principle of universal jurisdiction.73 In at least two States, universal jurisdiction 
is provided for by procedural law, while <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i> is not.74 In a limited 
number of States one principle or the other, or the combination of the two principles apply 
to any act of enforced disappearance.75 In many cases those principles are codified with 
express reference only to crimes against humanity or more generally to crimes coming 
under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.76 One State informed that its law 
does not make specific reference to the principle of universal jurisdiction, although two 
instances closely reflect the concept, namely the exercise of jurisdiction over genocide and 
the offences that this State is bound to suppress under its treaty obligations.77 Also, in the 
same State, while the Criminal Procedure Code does not make specific reference to the 
principle <i>aut dedere aut judicare</i>, the principle is largely observed by virtue of the 
legislation in force and jurisprudence tends to apply it. 
</p>
<p>61. However, several States observed that, as enforced disappearance is not codified as a 
separate offence under their criminal legislation, the principles of universal jurisdiction and 
<i>aut dedere aut judicare</i> would not apply to such offence considered as such, which does not 
prevent to apply it to other acts linked to enforced disappearance78. This confirms the 
crucial importance to combat impunity of the codification of enforced disappearance as a 
separate offence.

<p>62. <b>The Working Group would like to thank all the States that have responded to 
its questionnaires, thus providing a reliable legal basis for its study on best practices. 
While the details of those best practices are developed in the report itself, the Working 
Group would like to highlight certain of those best practices that should be followed 
by all States: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Ratification of the relevant international instruments and incorporation 
of those instruments in domestic legislation, in particular, the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court and the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Codification of an autonomous offence of enforced disappearance 
sufficiently broad to cover enforced disappearances committed as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population, but also isolated acts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Inclusion in the definition of the crime of the three following cumulative 
minimum elements: (i) deprivation of liberty of the victim; (ii) involvement of 
Government officials, at least indirectly by acquiescence; and (iii) refusal to disclose 
the fate and whereabouts of the person concerned;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Inclusion of the element of &#8220;placement of the victim outside the 
protection of the law&#8221; as a <i>consequence</i> of the other constitutive elements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Characterization of the offence of enforced disappearance as a 
continuous crime; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Establishment of a comprehensive regime of individual responsibility in 
relation to enforced disappearances, including superior responsibility;

<p><b> (g) Providing for appropriate penalties which take into account the extreme 
seriousness of the crime, whether qualified as a crime against humanity or not;
