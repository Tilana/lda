</p>
<p><b>Summary</b> 
</p>
<p>Mandated by Human Rights Council decision S-4/101 to assess the human rights 
situation in Darfur and the needs of the Sudan in this regard, members of the High-Level Mission 
on the situation of human rights in Darfur carried out their programme of work from 5 February 
to 5 March 2007 in Geneva, Addis Ababa, N&#8217;Djamena, Abeche and the refugee camps of 
Eastern Chad, meeting hundreds of relevant persons, reviewing thousands of pages of 
documents, assessing the human rights situation and corresponding needs, and preparing its 
report to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>Having determined that the effective protection of civilians in Darfur was the central 
issue at hand, and that the most appropriate framework for<b> </b>addressing this question was the 
framework of international human rights and humanitarian law, the Mission decided to employ 
an analysis drawn from the <i>responsibility to protect</i>.  Confirming that the Sudan has accepted the 
responsibility to protect, the Mission proceeds to an assessment of the situation in Darfur, noting 
the complex historical, economic, political and other causes of the conflict.   With the emergence 
of armed rebellion in the region, and the recruitment by the Government of proxy militias to 
respond to the rebellion, civilians emerged as the primary targets and victims.  Government 
forces often acted in concert with Janjaweed/militia, including in violations of human rights.  
Rebel movements also engaged in human rights abuses.  Armed banditry and criminal activities 
have increased significantly. 
</p>
<p>Numerous efforts by the international community have not been successful in ending the 
conflict.  Rebel movements have become increasingly fragmented and abuses have continued.  
Even after the signing of the DPA, war continues and the human rights situation has further 
deteriorated.<b> </b> Today, millions are displaced, at least 200,000 are dead, and conflict and abuse are 
spilling over the border into Chad.  Making matters worse, humanitarian space continues to 
shrink, and humanitarian and human rights actors are increasingly targeted.  Killing of civilians 
remains widespread, including in large-scale attacks.  Rape and sexual violence are widespread 
and systematic.  Torture continues.  Arbitrary arrest and detention are common, as is repression 
of political dissent, and arbitrary restrictions on political freedoms.<b>  </b>Mechanisms of justice and 
accountability where they exist are under-resourced, politically compromised, and ineffective.  
The region is heavily armed, further undercutting the rule of law, and meaningful disarmament 
and demobilization of the Janjaweed, other militia and rebel movements is yet to occur.  Darfur 
suffers from longstanding economic marginalization and underdevelopment, and the conflict has 
resulted in further impoverishment.  As violations and abuses continue unabated, a climate of 
impunity prevails. 
</p>
<p>For its part, the international community, acting through the United Nations and the 
African Union, has intervened with diplomatic, humanitarian, human rights and development 
assistance, but the vast majority of its recommendations remain unimplemented by the 
Government, and effective protection for civilians is yet to be secured.  Critical needs for  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>improving the situation of human rights in Darfur are numerous, and include (1) enhanced 
protection (2) renewed progress toward peace (3) expanded humanitarian space (4) increased 
accountability for perpetrators (5) programmes to address root causes (6) efforts to ensure the 
implementation of existing recommendations from authoritative human rights bodies; and 
(7) compensation for the victims of violations of human rights.  To these ends, the Mission 
makes a number of specific recommendations for action by the Human Rights Council, the 
Government, rebel movements and the international community. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The High-Level Mission 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 13 December 2006, at its fourth special session, the Human Rights Council adopted 
by consensus decision S-4/101 on the situation of human rights in Darfur, in which it decided to 
dispatch a High-Level Mission (HLM) with the mandate &#8220;to assess the human rights situation in 
Darfur and the needs of the Sudan in this regard &#8230; and to report to the Council at its fourth 
session to be held from 12 March to 5 April 2007&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Members and staff 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 26 January 2007, HRC President, Ambassador Luis Alfonso de Alba announced the 
appointment of the members of the Mission.  The members, serving in their personal capacities, 
included Professor and Nobel Peace Laureate Jody Williams (Head of Mission), 
Professor Bertrand Ramcharan, the Honorable Mart Nutt, H.E. Ambassador Makarim Wibisono, 
H.E. Ambassador Patrice Tonda, as well as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Sudan, Dr. Sima Samar.  On 14 February 2007, H.E. Ambassador Makarim 
Wibisono discontinued his participation in the mission and thus did not take part in the 
preparation of this report.  The HLM was supported and accompanied by a team of staff 
appointed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The members of the Mission would 
like to express their appreciation to the members of the OHCHR secretariat for their extreme 
professionalism and dedication to the successful completion of the Mission.   
</p>
<p><b>3.  Terms of reference and working methods 
</b></p>
<p>3. Convening on 5 February in Geneva, the HLM adopted its terms of reference, focusing 
on our mandate &#8220;to assess the human rights situation in Darfur, and the needs of the Sudan in this 
regard, and to report to the Council at its fourth session&#8221;.  We determined that assessing the 
situation did not require a human rights fact-finding mission, as such.  Volumes of 
documentation of abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL) in Darfur 
from early 2003 to today are abundant.  Therefore, for our assessment, we meant to gather as 
much information on the current situation from as many sources as possible.  Our intention was 
then to give our collective informed perspective on the human rights situation in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>4. We understood assessing the needs of the Sudan vis-&#224;-vis the human rights situation in 
Darfur to include needs of the Government of the Sudan, civil society and affected communities 
and individuals that the Government, in the first instance, has the responsibility to protect.  We 
noted that the Human Rights Council decision welcomed the signing of the Darfur Peace 
Agreement (DPA), urged its full implementation and called upon non-signatories to sign and all 
parties to observe the ceasefire.  The DPA was negotiated in 2005, and signed on 5 May 2006.  
We therefore decided that our assessment of the situation would primarily focus on the period 
from January 2005 to March 2007. 
</p>
<p>5. We convened in Geneva from 5 to 9 February to begin our work planning and 
consultation.  While in Geneva, we consulted<b> </b>a number of organizations and individuals and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reviewed relevant documentation.  Planning our programme, we decided that our work outside 
of Geneva would take place from 10 to 21 February, and that we would reconvene in Geneva 
from 26 February to 2 March to draft our report.   
</p>
<p>6. In considering our travel programme, we determined that priority should be given to 
visits to Khartoum, Darfur, Addis Ababa, and eastern Chad.  In Khartoum, we hoped to meet 
with senior government officials, United Nations and African Union Mission in the Sudan 
(AMIS) personnel, and representatives of civil society.  In Darfur, we intended to meet victims, 
witnesses and key parties.  In Addis Ababa, seat of the Africa Union, we sought to meet senior 
AU officials, given the vital role of the AU in addressing the Darfur crisis.  Finally, given that 
hundreds of thousands of Darfurians now reside in refugee camps and communities in eastern 
Chad, we thought it important for some of our members to also visit those areas to meet directly 
with witnesses and victims, many of whom are recent arrivals from Darfur.  This was 
particularly advisable given the critical security situation in Darfur, and the consequent greater 
access to and freedom of expression of those residing in Chad.   
</p>
<p>7. We decided that our report to the Human Rights Council would include a situation 
assessment and a needs assessment along with specific recommendations to the Council, to the 
Government of the Sudan, to the rebels, and to the international community toward stopping 
violations of human rights and alleviating the acute suffering of the people of Darfur.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Cooperation of the Government of the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>8. Decision S-4/101 had welcomed Sudanese cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in the Sudan and called upon the Government to &#8220;continue and 
intensify its cooperation with the Human Rights Council, its mechanisms, and the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8221;.  Unfortunately, the Sudanese authorities did not issue 
visas for the Mission to enter the Sudan.   
</p>
<p>9. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had the opportunity to discuss the HLM with 
President Bashir while at the AU Summit in Addis Ababa on 29-30 January and received his 
personal commitment and assurance that the Sudan would fully cooperate with the Mission as 
constituted. 
</p>
<p>10. The HLM applied for Sudanese, Ethiopian and Chadian visas in Geneva.  Problems with 
visas for the Sudan arose immediately.  Departing as planned on 10 February for Addis Ababa to 
continue our programme of work, we hoped that ongoing efforts on our behalf would result in 
Sudanese visas being issued while we were carrying out the Addis leg of our programme.  
</p>
<p>11. On 14 February, when we had planned to begin our work in the Sudan (in accordance 
with our programme of work), we still had no visas.  The continuing delay was creating 
significant logistical and planning challenges to our Mission.  Nevertheless, in a spirit of 
cooperation, and before changing our tickets from the Sudan to Chad that afternoon, we made a 
final, unsuccessful attempt to secure visas.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. All in all, more than a dozen attempts over the 20-day period from 26 January 
through 14 February 2007 were made in Geneva, Addis Ababa and Khartoum to obtain our visas 
and secure the cooperation of the Government of the Sudan.  Upon our return to Geneva, we 
continued to offer cooperation, seeking briefings and information from Government officials, but 
to no avail.  
</p>
<p><b>5.  Programme of work 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consultations 
</b>13. In Geneva, we had more than thirty consultations with representatives of United Nations 
agencies, former senior United Nations officials in Sudan, the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, international and Darfurian human rights organizations, human rights representatives 
from Darfur, and international humanitarian organizations, as well as with Darfur researchers.  
The HLM also met with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the Human 
Rights Council, and the Executive Director of the Commission of Inquiry for Darfur, and 
OHCHR staff.  We held discussion as well with United Nations Special Envoy Jan Eliasson and 
AU Special Envoy Salim Ahmed Salim.  Members of the Mission also met three times with the 
Ambassador of the Sudan in Geneva, and with Ambassadors from the African Union, with the 
Coordinator and other representatives of the European Union and with the Eastern European 
group. 
</p>
<p>14. In Addis Ababa, we were briefed by officials of the African Union, led by the 
Commissioner for Peace and Security.  We also received military and police briefings from 
AMIS.  We spoke with individuals from Darfur, including a former Governor and the head of a 
Darfurian human rights organization.  The HLM met with the ECA Acting Executive Secretary, 
and subsequently with representatives of the ECA&#8217;s Working Group on Darfur, and with a 
member of the United Nations Panel of Experts of the Sanctions Committee of the Security 
Council.  The HLM was also able to consult at length with the acting Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General for the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>15. Arriving in N&#8217;Djamena, members of the Mission met with the United Nations Country 
Team, as well as with representatives of rebel movements including the Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) and the secretariat of the National Redemption Front (NRF).  The Mission also 
discussed the case of Suleiman Jamous with advocates on his behalf.  In Abeche, we also had 
numerous discussions with United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees, and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs representatives, working 
both with Darfurian refugees and Chadians displaced by militia incursions from Darfur.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Field visits in eastern Chad 
</b>16. In Gaga Refugee Camp, UNHCR and the camp leadership provided a general briefing of 
the refugee situation in eastern Chad<b>, </b>as well as on Gaga itself.  Opened in May 2005, the camp 
houses more than 13,000 refugees from Darfur, most of whom have arrived in the past year. <b> 
</b>Gaga receives newly arriving refugees on a daily basis.  Following this introductory meeting, the 
Mission divided itself into three teams, the first meeting with a cross-section of the camp&#8217;s 
refugees, another with refugees who had undergone torture, and a third with a group of women 
refugees.  Members of the Mission heard first-hand accounts of violations suffered by residents. <b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. In Breidjing Camp, which opened in May 2005 and houses more than 29,000 people, 
members of the Mission held a general meeting with 70 camp leaders and residents, including 
both men and women.  Subsequently, we again divided into three teams, the first meeting with a 
group of about 30 women, the second with male victims of violence, and the third with a 
cross-section of camp residents.  Again, the Mission heard details of human rights violations 
committed in Darfur.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Document review 
</b>18. The HLM was provided with relevant United Nations and African Union documentation, 
and received additional documentation from many with whom it met and corresponded, 
including from human rights and humanitarian relief agencies and non-governmental 
organizations.  (For a full list of documents consulted, see annex IV.)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  The responsibility to protect 
</b></p>
<p>19. In a landmark decision at the World Summit in September 2005, the international 
community, building on the obligations of member States under the Charter of the 
United Nations, formally embraced the principle of the responsibility to protect.  In doing so, it 
declared that every State has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war 
crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, and that, where a state is unable or 
unwilling to do so, it is the responsibility of the international community to take action to ensure 
effective protection.  In assessing the human rights situation in Darfur and the needs of the Sudan 
in that regard, and in formulating our recommendations, we considered that the effective 
protection of civilians in Darfur was the central issue at hand.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Sudan joined in the adoption of the World Summit Outcome, explicitly accepting its 
responsibility to protect and pledging to act in accordance with it.<b>1</b>  With its ratification of 
various human rights and humanitarian law treaties it has also accepted specific legal obligations 
that underpin this responsibility.<b>2</b>  In signing other treaties while not yet ratifying them, it 
remains legally bound to refrain from acts that would defeat the objects and purposes of those 
treaties.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Subsequently, on 28 April 2006, the Security Council passed resolution 1674 (2006) 
</p>
<p>reaffirming the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome 
document regarding the responsibility to protect.  In addition to condemning violations of human 
rights and international humanitarian law, the resolution also states that &#8220;ending impunity is 
essential&#8221; to address abuses against civilians during armed conflict and prevent such abuses in 
the future. 
<b>2
</b>  These treaties include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child; the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights; and the four Geneva Conventions 
of 1949. 
<b>3
</b>  These include the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>21. The signature by the Sudan of various political agreements also reflects its acceptance of 
this responsibility.  In July 2004 during a visit to the Sudan by the Secretary-General, a Joint 
Communiqu&#233; was signed between the Government and the United Nations.  The communiqu&#233; 
contains a number of commitments relating to the Government&#8217;s responsibility to protect its 
populations, their lives and welfare, in particular during internal armed conflict, by taking action 
to guarantee human rights.<b>4</b>  Additionally, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that the 
Government signed with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) on 
9 January 2005 contains a number of provisions relating to the protection of human rights.  The 
Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) of 5 May 2006 contains an explicit section on human rights.   
</p>
<p>22. Sudan&#8217;s Interim National Constitution includes a Bill of Rights that guarantees most of 
the rights contained in the international human rights treaties, including rights contained in 
international instruments to which the Sudan is not a party (for example the Convention Against 
Torture).  It also provides for a national human rights Commission, to be established under its 
terms. 
</p>
<p>23. With<b> </b>regard to national plans and policies, the Government Plan for the Restoration of 
Stability and Protection of Civilians in Darfur (August 2006) is based on the DPA and the 
timeline established for its implementation.  It contains a number of human rights-related 
elements, with specific objectives, activities, implementation measures, timing and requirements 
for action by the United Nations and other partners.<b>5</b> The National Action Plan to End Violence 
against Women in Darfur (November 2005) also contains specific time-bound actions by various 
ministries.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  DARFUR:  SITUATION ASSESSMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Brief history and causes of the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>24. The causes of conflict in Darfur are complex.  Historically, tribal groups have come into 
conflict over land, water or livestock, but such disputes were settled through traditional tribal 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  This includes a moratorium on restrictions for all humanitarian work in Darfur, a commitment 
</p>
<p>to undertake concrete measures to end impunity, to deploy immediate investigations of all 
ceasefire violations, to provide adequate resources for (Independent Investigation Committee) 
investigations, to implement resulting recommendations, to ensure that all individuals accused of 
human rights violations are brought to justice without delay, to allow the deployment of human 
rights monitors and to establish a fair system, respectful of local traditions that will allow abused 
women to bring charges against alleged perpetrators.  It agreed as well to deploy a strong, 
credible and respected police force in all IDP areas as well as in areas susceptible to attacks, to 
train them in human rights law and to hold them responsible for upholding it. 
<b>5
</b>  See document S/2006/665 of 17 August 2006 containing the letter from the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>addressed to the President of the Security Council and transmitting the Plan of the Government 
of the Sudan for the restoration of stability and protection of civilians in Darfur.    </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mechanisms.<b>6</b>  But in the 1970s, in part in an effort to modernize, Khartoum introduced a number 
of administrative changes that began to erode those mechanisms.  First Darfur was divided into 
three states, fragmenting the collective power of tribal groups.  Khartoum then appointed new 
officials with both executive and judicial powers at the state level, and appointed leaders at the 
local level based upon loyalty to the central government, without regard to the traditional 
leadership recognized by the communities.<b>  </b>While traditional mechanisms were still sought out, 
those structures were severely weakened, just as power relations between groups were being 
distorted. 
</p>
<p>25. In the 1970s and the 1980s, increased desertification and drought resulted in significant 
movements of people, with nomadic groups moving deeper into southern areas as well as 
&#8220;newcomers&#8221; entering from Chad, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Mauritania.  With Darfur&#8217;s 
own issues of scarce water and other resources, relations became increasingly contentious.  The 
intensity of conflicts increased significantly with the formation of village defence groups and 
militias and the influx of small arms and light weapons into the region.  By the end of the 1980s 
most conflict was between the Fur and nomadic tribes. 
</p>
<p>26. In addition to the struggles around land and resources, the peoples of Darfur have felt 
discriminated against and marginalized by the central Government.  Generally excluded from 
social services normally provided by the State such as education and basic medical care, they 
have had no significant political voice in Khartoum.  Attempts by the Government to mediate 
ongoing tribal conflicts produced no long-term results, fuelling the perception that Khartoum 
was unwilling or unable to protect Darfurians or to address their broader needs.  Quite to the 
contrary, as fighting intensified between 1995-1998, the Government began its recruitment of 
militias, further aggravating divisions. 
</p>
<p>27. Against this backdrop of conflict and marginalization, two rebel groups began to organize 
in 2001/02 &#8211; the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) &#8211; drawing their members primarily from village defence groups.  Most rebels 
were from the Fur, Massalit and Zaghawa tribes.  Interestingly, they were calling for equality  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  While Darfur is made up of many dozens of ethnic groups and tribes, all are of the Muslim 
</p>
<p>faith and Arabic is the &#8220;lingua franca.&#8221;  Land is a fundamental issue in Darfur and ownership has 
traditionally been communal.  The predominant tribes in Darfur live in generally mutually 
accepted homelands, called <i>dar</i>.  These include that of the Fur around Jebel Marra and the 
Zaghawa in parts of West and North Darfur.  Also in West Darfur around El Geneina and to its 
south are the Masalit.  The Rizeigat, the largest and most powerful of the Arab tribes, are mainly 
found in the southern parts of South Darfur.   Some groups are primarily sedentary 
agriculturalists, and some of these also herd cattle.  Others, primarily Arab, are nomadic and 
semi-nomadic and traditionally have passed through other tribal homelands as they moved with 
their herds of camels and cattle.  The nomadic Arab tribes, north of Jebel Marra, are known as 
<i>Abbala</i>, and include the Taaysha, the Habaneya, the Beni Helba, the Mahameed and others.  The 
sedentary southern Arab tribes are collectively called <i>Baggara.</i>  Some tribal sections are Abbala 
in some parts of Darfur, but Baggara in others.  These complex tribal configurations become 
even more so with generations of intermarriage and other intertribal relations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and justice for all Sudanese and not just redress of more narrow tribal interests.  The rebel forces 
began attacking Government police and military targets in late 2002, and those attacks 
accelerated in 2003. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Nature of the Government&#8217;s response 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Government was not prepared either for the intensity or the successes of the rebel 
attacks.  With many of its forces engaged in its long war with the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation 
Army (SPLA) in South Sudan, Khartoum was also concerned because many rank-and-file 
soldiers in the Sudanese military were from Darfur.  The Government significantly picked up its 
recruitment of proxy militias, continuing to exploit the existing and ongoing tensions between 
tribal groups.  Those members of Arab tribes recruited to fight in Government-backed 
counterinsurgency operations became known as &#8220;Janjaweed,&#8221; which is a term used in Darfur for 
an armed man on horse or camel. 
</p>
<p>29. Janjaweed attacks, sometimes in concert with Government land and air forces have been 
and continue to be primarily directed against the civilian population of Darfur, and focused 
especially on the tribal groups from which most of the rebels have been drawn.  In both refugee 
camps, and in our discussions with a number of observers, we were told of such joint attacks on 
civilians.  Women, children and men have been killed indiscriminately.  Villages have been 
razed, livestock stolen or killed, and crops destroyed, and whole populations forcefully 
displaced, in part in an attempt to deprive rebel groups of support and resources.  In particular, 
rape and sexual assault have been widespread and systematic, terrorizing women and breaking 
down families and communities.<b>7</b>   
</p>
<p><b>III. THE DARFUR PEACE AGREEMENT, THE ENSUING VIOLENCE 
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
</b></p>
<p>30. Attempts to resolve the conflict began in 2003, and a ceasefire between the Government 
and the SLM/A was signed on 3 September of that year.  A report to the AU Peace and Security 
Council read: &#8220;Following the September Ceasefire Agreement, fighting largely stopped between 
the Government and the SLM/A.  However violence intensified against the civilian population.  
A militia group called &#8216;<i>DJanjaweed&#8217;</i> deliberately targeted civilians viewed as providing support 
to the SLM/A and the JEM.&#8221;<b>8</b>

PSC/PR/2(V), p. 2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. As violence and violations of human rights continued, so did attempts to stop the conflict.  
On 8 April 2004, the Government, the SLM/A, and JEM signed a humanitarian ceasefire 
agreement and protocols on establishing humanitarian assistance in Darfur.  The ceasefire 
agreement called for the establishment of a Ceasefire Commission (CFC) to monitor the 
cessation of hostilities, supported by an AU Observer Mission.  Appeals were made to the 
United Nations and the international community to support the CFC, to &#8220;ensure the scrupulous 
compliance&#8221; of warring parties to the ceasefire.<b>9</b>    
</p>
<p>32. Subsequent efforts for peace in Darfur took place in Addis Ababa and in Abuja mediated 
by the African Union and with all parties to the conflict participating.  But against this backdrop, 
violence was again on the rise in Darfur as all parties sought military gains to advantage them in 
the talks.  At the seventh round of negotiations, the Darfur Peace Agreement was signed on 
5 May 2006, but only by the Government and by one faction of the SLM (that of Mini Minawi, 
SLM/MM).  The SLA faction led by Abdul Wahid (SLM/AW) did not sign, nor did the JEM. 
</p>
<p>33. Since the signing of the DPA, the security situation in the region has deteriorated.<b>  
</b>Non-signatory rebel factions have splintered.  Though hostilities have been significantly reduced 
between the two signatories to the DPA, fighting between signatories and those opposed to the 
DPA escalated in violation of the ceasefire agreements.<b>10</b>  Attempts by these factions to meet and 
develop common positions for renewed efforts to open the DPA to new negotiations have been 
attacked and bombed by Government forces.<b>11</b> Violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law have increased by all parties to the conflict since the signing of the DPA.  
Armed banditry and other criminal activity have also increased. 
</p>
<p>34. People began to flee the fighting that erupted in Sudan&#8217;s western region of Darfur in 
early 2003.  By the end of 2004, some 200,000 Sudanese had fled across the border to 
neighbouring Chad and an estimated 1.6 million were displaced within Darfur.  The deteriorating 
security situation since the DPA has resulted in tens of thousands of newly displaced &#8211; now 
totalling well over two million displaced people in Darfur -- and 30,000 more refugees in the 
camps in Chad, with new arrivals daily.<b>12</b>

</b></p>
<p>  Briefings to HLM by UNHCR and OCHA, Geneva and Abeche, February 2007; &#8220;There are 
presently an estimated 2 million displaced persons in north, south and west Darfur, including 
250,000 who have fled fighting in the past six months. In West Darfur alone, where UNHCR&#8217;s 
teams are mainly based, there are an estimated 700,000 displaced&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. Cross-border attacks into Chad by Janjaweed and retaliations by rebels and Chadian 
forces have resulted in a dramatic increase in Chadian IDPs &#8211; from about 30,000 in June of 2006 
to over 113,000 by the end of that year.<b>13</b>  Today, the conflict is also having a growing impact in 
the Central African Republic.  If the conflict in Darfur is not meaningfully and equitably 
resolved, bringing peace and security to its people, it could increasingly engulf the region.  
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for a peace-keeping force along both borders. 
</p>
<p>36. Humanitarian aid has, since the beginning of the conflict, consistently been restricted by 
the Government with delays in the issuing of visas, travel permits to go to Darfur, daily travel 
permits to leave the capitals in Darfur, and fuel permits to travel around Darfur.  But with the 
spiralling of violence since the DPA, humanitarian access to populations in dire need has been 
increasingly strangled and in some areas it has ceased entirely.  Action by rebel groups has also 
impacted humanitarian access in recent months.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Attacks on humanitarian agencies have increased dramatically over the past months.  
On 17 January 2007, in an unprecedented initiative, 14 United Nations agencies with operations 
in Darfur issued a Joint Statement on the urgency of the situation.  They noted that:  12 aid 
workers have been killed in the past six months -- more than in the previous two years; 30 NGO 
and United Nations compounds were directly attacked by armed groups; and more than 400 aid 
workers were forced to relocate 31 times from different locations throughout the 3 Darfur states 
in both government and rebel controlled areas   There have also been three sexual assaults on 
relief workers in the previous five months &#8211; the first in September 2006 by Janjaweed /militia, 
the second in December 2006 by SLA/MM forces, and the third on 19 January 2007 by 
Government police and National Security agents.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. SUDAN&#8217;S ACTIONS REGARDING THE 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
</b></p>
<p>38. The witnesses, victims and observers with whom we spoke, and the United Nations and 
other documentation consulted underscore that the killing of civilians in Darfur remains 
widespread.  Violence has increased since late 2005 and has continued unabated into 2007.<b>16</b>  
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  See UNHCR briefing note January 2007 &#8220;While there has been a decrease in fighting between 
</p>
<p>the Chadian army and opposition forces, intercommunal conflict continues in south-eastern parts 
of the country near the border with Sudan&#8217;s Darfur region.  More than 10,000 Chadians have 
been driven from their homes in cross-border attacks by alleged Janjaweed militia in the Borota 
region, and another 10,000 have fled more than 20 villages and are now gathered in the town of 
Gassire, 8 km north of Goz Beida.  This insecurity is now posing a direct threat to refugee camps 
housing thousands of Sudanese from Darfur&#8221;.  See www.unhcr.org.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>There were numerous large scale attacks on civilian communities during this period.  
Descriptions of these attacks indicate that tactics used have been very similar to those used 
during the height of the war in Darfur in late 2003 and 2004, characterized by (1) coordination of 
operations between the Sudanese armed forces and government-supported militia, (2) failure to 
respect the principles of distinction and proportionality, and (3) grave violations of international 
human rights and humanitarian law.  While precise figures are not available, the United Nations 
estimates that 200,000 civilians have been killed as a direct result of the conflict or due to its 
devastating impact on access to health care, food and other life essentials.  
</p>
<p>39. Rape and sexual violence are widespread across Darfur, including cases of gang-rape.<b>17</b>  
Since May 2006 sexual violence has also been reported in intra-tribal attacks.  Despite the 
well-known patterns of rape of women around IDP camps, the authorities have done little to 
diminish the threat or investigate cases reported.  Monitoring of the criminal justice system over 
the last two years has shown that very few cases of rape are investigated or prosecuted relative to 
the number of incidents that occur.  Access to justice and prosecution of rape is further 
complicated both by cultural and by institutional factors, including the provisions of the criminal 
law combining rape and adultery in the same article.<b>18</b>  Women are also attacked in and around 
refugee camps in Chad.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>40. Arbitrary arrest and detention in Darfur by government security forces continue.  
Individuals reportedly targeted include lawyers, community leaders and others who work on

http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/sd/periodic_report.htm.<b>

</b></p>
<p>  Article 149 (1) of the Sudanese Criminal Act of 1991: <i>&#8220;There shall be deemed to commit the 
offence of rape, whoever makes sexual intercourse, by way of adultery, or sodomy, with any 
person without his consent&#8221;.<b></b></i><b> 
19
</b></p>
<p>  We were particularly struck by the stories of rape recounted to us by victims.  During our 
meeting with roughly thirty women in the camp of Breidjing, we learned of a total of nine rapes. 
Five women, who were 15, 17, 20, 21 and 45 years old, respectively, described having been gang 
raped in attacks on their villages. Another one while trying to return to her village to recover 
things left behind, and one by four Chadians when she left the refugee camp for firewood.  The 
45-year old woman was married and had eight children. When her husband learned of the rape, 
he divorced her. The other four rapes were described by a woman who told us that when her 
village was attacked and that she and three other women were surrounded.  An old woman was 
thrown into a fire and burned to death.  The woman telling us the story was being beaten while 
the two youngest women were repeatedly raped, and the husband of one of them was killed.  She 
became pregnant as a result of the rapes and when the baby was born it &#8220;died immediately&#8221; and 
she has been &#8220;sick&#8221; ever since.  All of the women &#8211; except for the one raped in Chad &#8211; said their 
attackers were Janjaweed.  When we had first met with the camp's leaders, one of the men talked 
about the raping of the women by the Janjaweed. He said, &#8220;Especially the raping of women -- 
how can they do this in the name of Islam? </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>human rights, Sudanese who work for international organizations or who are perceived as 
cooperating too closely with the international community, individuals who share the 
predominant ethnicities of various rebel groups, and Sudanese who display opposition political 
views.  Since May 2006 security forces have also targeted individuals who openly oppose the 
DPA.  Sudanese who work closely with IDPs are also targeted, often on the basis of accusations 
that they encourage popular discontent and anti-government sentiment. 
</p>
<p>41. Since September 2006 there has been a wave of arrests of Darfurians in Khartoum.  The 
arrests of over 30 Darfurian teachers, businessmen, journalists and university students 
predominately from the Fur, Masaalit and Zaghawa tribes have been carried out by the police 
and National Security, purportedly in furtherance of the investigation into the murder of 
Mohamed Taha, a prominent editor.  Former detainees suggest that the murder investigation is 
being used as a pretext to arrest those with perceived links to rebel movements in Darfur.  To 
date 13 detainees have been released due to lack of evidence, with three released as recently as 
29 January 2007.  Another three continue to be held without charge while 19 others have been 
charged with murder.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>42. Arbitrary restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly are 
widespread.  Human rights defenders, lawyers, local leaders and political opponents voicing 
concerns or expressing views that are critical, of the Government, continue to be particularly 
vulnerable to abuses by state security agencies.  The United Nations has documented numerous 
cases of people being harassed, arrested, detained and physically abused for voicing their human 
rights concerns.  The victims include members of NGOs, journalists, and people who file 
complaints with the police or other government officials.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>43. The HLM has also received credible information of torture, inhumane and degrading 
treatment by National Security and Military Intelligence during attacks and in the treatment of 
detainees.  The methods used include beatings with whips, sticks and gun butts, prolonged sun 
exposure, starvation, electrocution, and burning with hot candle wax or molten plastic.  Many 
detainees are held incommunicado without charge or access to a lawyer.   
</p>
<p><b>A.  Ongoing displacement and interference with humanitarian assistance 
</b></p>
<p>44. Ongoing attacks have resulted in massive displacement of civilians.  According to the 
United Nations, there were 25,000 new IDPs in Darfur as of January 2007, bringing the total to 
over 2 million in the three regions of Darfur.  We learned that there are 233,000 refugees from 
Darfur currently residing in Eastern Chad and receiving services from UNHCR.  Many other 
refugees are being hosted in communities along the border.  In addition to Chad, the Central 
African Republic has also suffered important consequences of the spill-over from Darfur.<b>21 
</b></p>
<p>45. Attacks on humanitarian workers, obstacles and interference with humanitarian aid by the 
Government and armed militia have increased during 2006-2007.  The humanitarian situation in

</b>  Article 130 of the Sudanese Criminal Act of 1991. </p>
<p><b>21
</b>  OCHA briefing note on the humanitarian situation in Chad, January 2007.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Darfur remains critical and humanitarian space and access in the three regions of Darfur has been 
rapidly diminishing over the past year.  Access has deteriorated to a level worse than in 2004, 
even as there has been a huge increase in the number of people relying on humanitarian aid.  In 
the last six months of 2006, more relief workers were killed than in the previous two years 
combined.  Just during the month of December 2006, 29 humanitarian vehicles were hijacked 
and 430 humanitarian workers relocated in all three Darfur states.   
</p>
<p><b>B.  Accountability and justice 
</b>46. Although formally, the national court system in Sudan is functional and has jurisdiction 
over human rights crimes perpetrated in Darfur, these courts have been unable to resolve human 
rights abuses there.  There is an acute shortage of judges and other judicial staff.  Although there 
have been a few exceptional cases of domestic courts charging state officials in cases involving 
conflict-related crimes, the justice system as a whole is unable or unwilling to pursue justice or 
prevent attacks, and this is compounded by a general lack of independence and resources, an 
ill-equipped police force and legislation that protects state officials from criminal prosecution. 
</p>
<p>47. In the face of growing international criticism over the lack of the rule of law, the fair 
administration of justice as well as of mechanisms to address impunity in Darfur, the 
Government of Sudan has announced a number of initiatives.  Between 2004 and 2006, it created 
at least five judicial and quasi-judicial bodies with the mandate to ensure accountability for 
human rights crimes in the war-torn region.  To date, these bodies have had limited results in 
dealing with the widespread and serious violations committed in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>48. The first of these bodies was the National Commission of Inquiry established in 
May 2004 by the President of the Sudan to investigate human rights violations committed by 
armed groups in Darfur.  Reportedly it met over 65 times and listened to 28 witnesses, and made 
a number of visits to Darfur.  But it appears that the Commission did not go beyond 
recommending &#8220;further investigations&#8221; into a number of specified incidents.<b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>49. Ad Hoc Investigatory Committees were established in Darfur in response to incidents of 
armed attacks against civilians.  Nothing significant has come from these initiatives in terms of 
redress for victims or accountability for perpetrators.  In July, the Minister of Justice established 
by Special Decree the Committees against Rape to look into the issue of rape and sexual 
violence in Darfur.  According to observers, no specific investigations or cases have been 
brought by the Committee to date.<b>23</b>  Another body known as the Unit for Combating Violence 
against Women and Children was established under the Ministry of Justice.  Though initially 
hailed as a positive step, it has reportedly not investigated human rights crimes, and has been 
criticized as ineffective.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. The most elaborate attempt by the Government of the Sudan to create an accountability 
mechanism with conventional judicial elements was the establishment of the Special Criminal 
Court on the Events in Darfur (SCCED).  Created by a decree of the Chief Justice, the Court was 
initially constituted as a panel of three judges, based in El Fasher but with ability to circuit to any 
location deemed appropriate.  It was granted wide jurisdiction covering all crimes in the 
Sudanese Penal Code and any charges concerning investigations into the violations cited in the 
report of the Commission of Inquiry and any charges pursuant to any other law, as determined by 
the Chief Justice.  On 26 November 2005, the Chief Justice established two additional Special 
Criminal Courts for Nyala and El Geneina with the same jurisdiction as the initial SCCED, but 
with the addition of international humanitarian law (IHL).  The SCCED statutes also contained 
explicit provisions on the right of observers from the AU or other entities to attend the court 
hearings.  
</p>
<p>51. The effectiveness of this court has been limited at best.  According to observers, only 
nine known cases have come before the Court.<b>24</b> The court delivered a verdict in eight of them.  
A ninth case was initially heard but later dismissed.  Only one of these cases dealt with the types 
of major violations of human rights and the laws of war that have characterized the conflict in 
Darfur -- an October 2005 attack on Tama in South Darfur.<b>25</b> No one was found guilty of taking 
part or held responsible for orchestrating the attack.  The men charged in relation to the attack 
were found guilty only of stealing property at the site of the attack after it took place.  According 
to informed observers, the SCCED has also<b> </b>not addressed the issue of criminal responsibility for 
senior-level officials in Darfur and Sudan.  Only one high-ranking official was ever charged and 
he was acquitted.  Ten State officials, all low-level officers, have been convicted by the SCCED. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The militias 
</b></p>
<p>52. Witnesses, victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between 
Government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in Darfur.  The DPA requires 
that the Government implement a plan for the neutralization and disarmament of the Janjaweed 
and other militia.  A phased plan to these ends is supposed to be implemented under AU 
supervision.  This requirement, to date, remains largely unimplemented.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. Arms continue to flow freely, and heavily armed militia continue to operate across the 
territory of Darfur with impunity.<b>26</b>  Victims and witnesses with whom the Mission met 
frequently identified the provision of arms by the Government to the Janjaweed and other 
militias as one of the most significant factors in fostering tensions and violence between tribal 
groups and communities.

</b>  Four in Nyala, three in El Fasher and two in El Geneina. 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  Such as the mass killings of civilians, widespread burning of villages, systematic rape, and the 
</p>
<p>other crimes documented by the International Commission of Inquiry. 
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  The DPA, including its disarmament provisions, is monitored by UNMIS, which reports 
monthly on these matters in <i>The DPA Monitor, </i>available at www.unmis.org. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Development, economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>54. Gross disparities between the centre and other regions of the country, including Darfur, 
and unbalanced development policies have created a dual economy in the country, constituting 
one of the roots causes of the conflict.  Disparities in the distribution of national wealth and 
public resources have repeatedly been identified by rebel groups and militia, (including 
non-signatories to the DPA) as one of their principal grievances, and an engine of conflict in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>55. While the centre has been the focus of economic activity, the periphery, including Darfur, 
has not benefited either from any substantial economic development activities, or from any 
re-distribution of income, including from oil exports.  At the same time, local factors such as 
competition between communities and tribes for land and water resources, continued 
desertification, and environmental degradation, have contributed to increasing conflict between 
groups in Darfur.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>56. Compounding and complicating these long-standing disparities, the consequences of the 
Darfur conflict have resulted in the disruption of food systems, the collapse of livelihoods and 
the disintegration of already limited basic services in Darfur.  In addition, the widespread 
displacement, the massive destruction of villages, properties, and lands have resulted in 
increasingly precarious access to food and income.  Insecurity, losses of physical infrastructure, 
reduced economic activity, rampant military expenditure, loss of assets and related 
vulnerabilities have all contributed to a critical situation of deprivation in the region.  Today, the 
people of Darfur face a dramatic humanitarian crisis, and one which is further hampered by the 
obstruction of humanitarian access and a general shrinking of humanitarian space.  
</p>
<p><b>E.  Rebel abuses 
</b></p>
<p>57. Rebel abuses of human rights and humanitarian law also continue.  Civilians have been 
targeted in armed rebel attacks, and acts of rape and torture by rebel forces have also been 
documented.  There have been reports of attacks on aid convoys by rebel forces, putting the 
populations in these areas in a particularly precarious situation.  Many of the violations 
committed by rebels relate to the fragmentation of rebel groups and intra-rebel fighting that first 
erupted in March and April 2006 in North Darfur, and the situation has been further exacerbated 
by increased acts of violent banditry by armed criminal elements taking advantage of the chaos.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>V. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY&#8217;S  
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Efforts by the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Security Council has been continuously seized of the situation since the crisis 
erupted.  The Council adopted resolution 1564 (2004) on 18 September 2004 calling for an 
International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to investigate violations of international 
humanitarian and human rights law.  The Commission carried out it work in the final three 
months of 2004 and presented its landmark report in January 2005, establishing that the 
Government and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of international human 
rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international law, and that these </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>violations were so widespread and systematic that they may constitute crimes against humanity.  
The Commission also found credible evidence that, while not widespread and systematic, rebel 
forces from the JEM and SLA were responsible for serious violations of human rights and 
humanitarian law which may amount to war crimes.    
</p>
<p>59. The Security Council also passed three additional key resolutions in March 2005.  While 
not directed to Darfur, resolution<b> </b>1590 (2005), (24 March) established the United Nations 
Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and authorized deployment of up to 10,000 military personnel, 
plus a civilian component, for a UN Peace Support Operation to support the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement (CPA), by monitoring its implementation, investigating violations, observing 
the movement of armed groups and ensuring an adequate human rights presence.<b>27</b>  
Resolution 1591 (2005), (adopted on 29 March) imposed an arms embargo on all parties in 
Darfur and provided for travel bans and the freezing of assets of individuals who continue to 
violate commitments to end the conflict (to be designated by the Security Council Panel of 
Experts).  Resolution 1593 (2005) (adopted on 31 March) referred the situation in Darfur to the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), allowing the ICC to examine and act on alleged perpetrators 
of crimes in Darfur, including those identified by the International Commission of Inquiry. 
</p>
<p>60. On 31 August 2006, the Security Council passed resolution 1706 (2006) explicitly 
reaffirming the elements of the responsibility to protect as contained in the 2005 World Summit 
outcome document, determined that the situation in the Sudan constitutes a threat to international 
peace and security, and decided to deploy an international peacekeeping force with a Chapter VII 
mandate allowing for the use of force for protection of civilians.   
</p>
<p>61. During this period, other agencies and United Nations bodies were also trying to assist 
the Government to exercise its responsibility to protect the peoples of Darfur.  In March 2001, 
OHCHR began a programme of technical cooperation for human rights with the Government, 
with projects for the administration of justice, legislative reform, human rights education and 
capacity building in the formal and informal sectors.  In April-May 2004, OHCHR sent two 
fact-finding missions to Chad and Darfur, and on 7 May 2004, the acting High Commissioner for 
Human Rights briefed the Security Council on the mission&#8217;s findings.  Its report recommended 
the establishment of an international commission of inquiry into the ongoing situation (see 
above) and highlighted the urgent need to deploy United Nations human rights observers to 
Darfur.  Subsequently, in response to the Darfur crisis, OHCHR deployed a team of human 
rights monitors to Khartoum and Darfur in August 2004 to support protection efforts in Darfur 
and to monitor, report and follow up on individual cases.  Following the creation of the 
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), OHCHR technical cooperation activities were 
integrated into the human rights component of UNMIS in June 2005. 
</p>
<p>62. The United Nations has also provided technical assistance for the implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement which requires sweeping reforms to governance, the creation 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  Human rights officers in Darfur conduct daily monitoring activities, investigating reports of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, interviewing victims and witnesses, following up on cases with local 
authorities and making recommendations on corrective action that should be taken to prevent 
further violations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of new institutions, and significant capacity building at all levels of government.  If followed 
through, these could contribute to effective decentralization and equitable resource allocation 
which in turn would be important elements of a long-term resolution to the existing conflict in 
Darfur and potential conflicts in other parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>63. Other UN efforts have included a dedicated special procedure of the Commission on 
Human Rights and its successor the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in 
the Sudan since 1993.  The Special Rapporteur has undertaken field visits and reported to both 
the Commission and the Council<b> </b>and the General Assembly on the situation with 
recommendations for action to promote and protect human rights.  In addition to the Sudan 
country mandate of the CHR/HRC, special rapporteurs and independent experts for thematic 
areas relevant to the crisis in Darfur have undertaken fact-finding missions to Darfur and made 
numerous recommendations since 2004.<b>28</b>  United Nations human rights treaty bodies have also 
made countless recommendations to the Sudan.<b>29</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Efforts by the African Union  
</b></p>
<p>64. In its communiqu&#233; of 25 May 2004, the AU Peace and Security Council requested the 
AU Commission on the Situation in Darfur to take all steps deemed necessary to ensure an 
effective monitoring of the Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement of 8 April 2004 through the 
deployment of an Observer Mission, with a civilian component and, if necessary, a protection 
element, to support the work of the Ceasefire Commission.<b> 30</b> 
</p>
<p>65. In October 2004 the AU Peace and Security Council agreed on an enhanced AMIS 
mission.  The mission was further mandated to improve the security situation in Darfur and 
oversee the safe return of refugees and IDPs to their homes.  Tasks included: &#8220;Protect civilians 
whom it encounters under imminent threat and in the immediate vicinity, within resources and 
capability, it being understood that the protection of the civilian population is the responsibility 
of the Government of the Sudan&#8221;.<b>31</b>  Positive protection initiatives have included proactive

human rights situation in the Sudan.  See www.ohchr.org. 
<b>29
</b></p>
<p>  For example, in 2002 the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed its concern that the 
large majority of the concerns and recommendations adopted on October 1993 
(CRC/C/15/Add.6) following the Sudan&#8217;s initial report (CRC/C/3/Add.3) on the issue have been 
insufficiently addressed. In 2007 the Committee on the Rights of the Child (optional protocol) 
and the Human Rights Committee will review the periodic reports of the Sudan and its 
obligations under those instruments.

</p>
<p>66. In its communiqu&#233; of 30 November 2006, the AU Peace and Security Council 
endorsed a three-phased United Nations support package for AMIS, and extended the mandate 
to 1 January 2007.  Phase one would provide a light support package with a small number of UN 
advisors and some vital material assets.  The second phase<b> </b>represents a heavy support<b> </b>package 
with a number of critical enabling capabilities, including 2,250 military personnel and a number 
of civilian personnel to undertake substantive tasks related to the implementation of the DPA.  
The third phase would bring a fully-hybrid AU-UN operation.  At the time of the writing of this 
report, Phase One has been completed, and Phase Two is set to begin. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The responsibility of the international community 
to protect the people of Darfur:  current status 
</b></p>
<p>67. Important as these steps may be, they have not proven adequate in ensuring effective 
protection on the ground.  The Government of the Sudan publicly opposed resolution 1706 and 
has actively resisted the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur.  After 
intensive diplomatic effort, Khartoum accepted, in Addis Ababa in November 2006, to allow the 
three-phased hybrid approach.  But in March 2007, almost five years into the conflict, and 
three years after the Security Council first expressed concern about the crisis in Darfur, the 
details of the arrangement are still being discussed with the Government of the Sudan.  Gross 
violations of human rights and grave breaches of humanitarian law continue across the region. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  NEEDS ASSESSMENT 
</b></p>
<p>68. Critical needs for improving the situation of human rights in Darfur are numerous and 
profound.  The region has long suffered from neglect and marginalization vis-&#224;-vis the country&#8217;s 
political, administrative and developmental centre in Khartoum.  Underdevelopment is evident 
across all economic and social sectors.  Democratic deficits are broad and longstanding.  Those 
public institutions that have existed have been starved for resources, and short on credibility 
among the region&#8217;s inhabitants.  The ongoing conflict has made a bad situation worse, further 
weakening public institutions, and distorting vital traditional mechanisms of governance, 
including, importantly, traditional mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of disputes between 
tribes.  In Darfur today, claims are asserted and disputes settled not principally through courts, or 
ministries or councils, but through armed militias, banditry, and violence.  The level of peace and 
stability necessary for development is absent.  Human resource challenges are prohibitive.  
Millions have fled.  Thousands have died.  Many more are gravely wounded.  In sum, war-torn 
Darfur, like most of the country lacks the most basic essentials for the rule of law, democratic 
governance, and the progressive realization of economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p>69. The long-term development challenges of the area, including those relating to addressing 
root causes, are daunting.  A review of key documentation including the report of the Joint 
Assessment Mission, and that of the Commission of Inquiry, reveals low confidence in public 
authorities and services, significant regional disparities, much higher than average poverty rates,  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>much lower Human Development Index ratings than other areas of the country, high disease 
rates, inadequate health services, high rates of child malnutrition, low numbers of families with 
adequate food supplies, and a general lack of access to justice. 
</p><p>70. The Mission has enquired and assessed the most pressing needs in Darfur.  The first of 
these, emphasized by virtually everyone we met, and a consistent theme in the documentation we 
collected, is the need for effective protection.  For most that we spoke to, this means a large, 
robust, broadly-mandated, well-resourced UN/AU peacekeeping/protection force deployed 
across the territory of Darfur.  The force should be supplemented by the contingent of UNMIS 
human rights monitors currently supported by the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  It 
should be accompanied as well by the proposed national human rights commission provided for 
in the interim national constitution, which should be established in accordance with the 
United Nations Paris Principles.  Establishing such a commission will require facilitated broad 
consultations, technical advice and assistance, and material support for start-up and early 
operations. 
</p>
<p>71. Secondly, peace is among the most pressing needs of the people of Darfur.  No one we 
met believed that a military solution to the conflict is possible, and all stressed the need for a 
negotiated solution to the crisis.  But the issue of renewed peace negotiations is a sensitive one.  
The Government had insisted that the DPA be signed <i>as is</i>.  Most others called for a reopening 
of peace negotiations to include all parties to the ongoing conflict.  Representatives of the 
non-signatory rebel movements with whom we met (including the NRF and JEM) as well as 
refugees that we met in Chad were adamant that the DPA as it stands does not adequately reflect 
their needs and aspirations.  They sought an &#8220;Abuja Plus&#8221; to address issues they viewed as 
unresolved, including power sharing, wealth sharing and compensation for victims.  When 
pressed on the DPA, the NRF and JEM told us they thought they were close to peace, with the 
signing of the First Declaration of Principles on 5 July 2005, but, as the various rounds of talks 
continued they said that international mediators became frustrated with the time it was taking to 
address outstanding issues in the negotiations and, in the seventh round, the DPA was forced on 
them.  They contrasted this with the long and delicate negotiations between the Government and 
SPLM/A that resulted in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the South.  Without renewed 
talks, they insist that peace will remain out of reach for the people of Darfur.  We also heard that 
to resolve the human rights situation in Darfur, any &#8220;Abuja Plus&#8221; type negotiations must include 
all stakeholders, including all fighting forces, civil society, human rights defenders, prominent 
individuals, women and women&#8217;s groups. 
</p>
<p>72. Third, while the international community has been generous in its support for 
humanitarian assistance to the people of Darfur, the effective delivery of that aid has been 
dramatically hampered by the obstruction of humanitarian access, assaults on humanitarian 
workers, and a general shrinking of humanitarian space.  Today, Darfur is confronted with an 
urgent need for expanded humanitarian access and safety, a need which requires not just aid 
funds, but also political will on the part of the Government and the various armed groups of  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Darfur to afford such access.  At the same time, sustained donor support in this, one of the 
world&#8217;s worst humanitarian crises, will be needed if the $1.2 billion price-tag for humanitarian 
assistance to Sudan in 2007 is to be met.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>73. Fourthly, in a region where impunity prevails and feeds upon itself, there is a vital need 
for accountability in Darfur.  Recent action by the ICC has offered new hope that the 
protagonists in the Darfur conflict will begin to understand that gross violations of human rights 
and grave breaches of humanitarian law will be subject to direct consequences for those who 
perpetrate them.  Support for the ICC process is thus essential to an improvement of the situation 
on the ground.  On 27 February 2007 the Prosecutor of the ICC asked pretrial judges to issue 
summons for Ahmad Harun, State Minister of Interior during the height of the Darfur conflict 
(2003-2004), and currently the Minister of State for Humanitarian Affairs, and militia 
commander Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb.  This action by 
the ICC begins to pierce the shield of impunity, but there is much more to be done.  Once an 
effective United Nations/African Union peacekeeping/protection force is in place, work must 
begin on a comprehensive programme of transitional justice, accountability and reconciliation.  
Such a process must begin with a Darfur-wide consultation, through which the views and wishes 
of all affected communities on an appropriate course of transitional justice can be heard.  
Financial, technical and facilitative support from the international community will be crucial to 
these ends. 
</p>
<p>74. Fifth, when the United Nations/African Union peacekeeping/protection force is in place, 
work should begin on addressing the root causes of conflict and human rights abuse in Darfur.  
Thus, dedicated international support for the building of national protection systems will be 
required.  Equally important will be human rights-based development cooperation across all 
sectors.  Such aid must be participatory, accountable, transparent, non-discriminatory, 
empowering, based on international human rights standards, and directed to building the capacity 
of the people of Darfur to claim and realize their rights, and of officials to deliver on their 
responsibilities.  The justice sector and dispute resolution capacities will need priority attention. 
And deliberate, rapid disarmament, demobilization and reintegration will be essential. 
</p>
<p>75. Finally, the Mission has assembled and catalogued a full listing of the many 
recommendations for remedial action made<b> </b>during the period under review<b> </b>by the various 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, among them the various special rapporteurs, the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the human rights treaty bodies, and the Commission of 
Inquiry, highlighting 115 of the most relevant in an indicative list.<b>33</b>  Many provide specific 
guidance on action to be taken to improve the situation.  The vast majority of them have yet to be 
implemented.  In the period following the deployment of the United Nations/African Union 
peacekeeping/protection force, these recommendations, taken together with broad Darfur

</p>
<p><b>VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>76. The High-Level Mission concludes that the situation of human rights in Darfur remains 
grave, and the corresponding needs profound.  The situation is characterized by gross and 
systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international humanitarian law.  
War crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region.  The principal pattern is one 
of a violent counterinsurgency campaign waged by the Government of the Sudan in concert with 
Janjaweed/militia, and targeting mostly civilians.  Rebel forces are also guilty of serious abuses 
of human rights and violations of humanitarian law.  All parties to the conflict must recognize 
that applicable human rights and humanitarian law standards must be respected during internal 
armed conflict and that the &#8220;fog of war&#8221; is not an acceptable justification for violating these 
standards.  While important steps have been taken by the international community, including the 
African Union and the United Nations, these have been largely resisted and obstructed, and have 
proven inadequate and ineffective.  The needs identified by the Mission include immediate, 
effective protection of civilians, renewed progress toward peace, expanded humanitarian space, 
increased accountability for perpetrators, action to address root causes, meaningful compensation 
and redress for victims, and concerted efforts to implement the many existing recommendations 
of authoritative international human rights bodies.  The Mission further concludes that the 
Government of the Sudan has manifestly failed to protect the population of Darfur from large-
scale international crimes, and has itself orchestrated and participated in these crimes.  As such, 
the solemn obligation of the international community to exercise its <i>responsibility to protect</i> has 
become evident and urgent. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Recommendations to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>(a) The Human Rights Council should remain seized of the situation in Darfur, 
regret the Government&#8217;s manifest failure in its responsibility to protect civilians, condemn 
the continuing violations, and call for effective protection for civilians, accountability for 
perpetrators (including through action by the ICC) and compensation and redress for 
victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Human Rights Council should establish a dedicated procedure or 
mechanism to monitor the situation of human rights in Darfur, to measure the degree of 
implementation of outstanding recommendations by relevant United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and reports (including the special procedures, the treaty bodies, the 
Commission of Inquiry report, the reports of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
and other relevant recommendations) and to report regularly to the Council.  The 
mechanism should work in close cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Sudan, whose mandate should be extended as required. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (c) The Human Rights Council should call for and actively support the 
establishment of a credible, independent national human rights commission for the Sudan, 
established in accordance with the Paris Principles and under the terms of the Interim 
National Constitution, with dedicated mandate, resources and capacity to address the 
grave situation in Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Recommendations to the Government of the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government of the Sudan should cooperate fully in the deployment of 
the proposed UN/AU peacekeeping/protection force without further delay.  It should 
remove all obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian assistance and abide scrupulously by 
the terms of the Moratorium on Restrictions on Humanitarian Work in Darfur and the 
Status of Forces Agreement.  It should ensure the free and safe movement of human rights 
monitors, and facilitate the access of UNMIS human rights offices and ICRC officials to all 
detainees and prisoners.  It should as well afford full cooperation to the International 
Criminal Court. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Government of the Sudan should fully comply with its obligations under 
international human rights and humanitarian law, as well as those voluntarily undertaken 
in the signing of political agreements relating to the Darfur conflict, (CPA, DPA, and 
others) and fully implement the many recommendations of United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and inquiries, still outstanding.  Sudan should end the targeting of civilians in 
Darfur, ceases all support for Janjaweed/militia forces, and proceeds with the 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of such forces.  It should hold perpetrators 
to account, facilitate the safe return of refugees and IDPs, and ensure compensation and 
redress for victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Government of the Sudan should advance the process of harmonization 
of all laws and policies with the Interim National Constitution and international human 
rights standards.  It should work for the establishment of a credible, independent national 
human rights commission for the Sudan, established in accordance with the Paris 
Principles and under the terms of the Interim National Constitution, with dedicated 
resources and capacity to address the grave situation in Darfur.  It should further create 
the necessary legislative framework and institutions for democratization and the holding of 
free and fair elections.  It should also move toward putting in place fair and equitable 
policies and programmes to reverse decades-long discrimination and economic, political 
and cultural marginalization of the people of Darfur. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Government of the Sudan should cooperate in the convening of a 
national conference on peace, human rights and a common vision for the Sudan, with the 
participation of political parties, women&#8217;s groups, human rights defenders, community 
representatives, tribal leaders, and a broad cross-section of civil society from across 
the country.  The national conference should be supported and facilitated by the 
United Nations and the African Union. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Recommendations to armed rebel movements in Darfur 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) All armed rebels movements operating in and around Darfur should strictly 
observe and respect the requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law, 
take all necessary steps to clearly distinguish themselves from the civilian population, 
abstain from efforts to recruit fighters in IDP and refugee camps, cease all attacks against 
civilian and humanitarian targets, and ensure the free and safe access and movement of 
humanitarian personnel.  All rebel movements should cooperate in good faith in the 
pursuit of peace. 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Security Council should take urgent further action to ensure the 
effective protection of the civilian population of Darfur, including through the deployment 
of the proposed UN/AU peacekeeping/protection force and full cooperation with and 
support for the work of the International Criminal Court.  All United Nations Security 
Council and African Union Peace and Security Council resolutions should be fully 
implemented, including those relating to travel bans and the freezing of funds, assets, and 
economic resources of those who commit violations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) The General Assembly of the United Nations should request the compilation 
of a list of foreign companies that have an adverse impact on the situation of human rights 
in Darfur.  The list should be published and periodically updated.  In addition, the 
General Assembly should call upon all United Nations institutions and offices to abstain 
from entering into business transactions with any of the identified companies. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) The member States of the United Nations should urgently provide adequate 
funding and support for the United Nations support package to AMIS, for the deployment 
of the proposed United Nations/African Union peacekeeping/protection force, for adequate 
numbers of international human rights monitors, for the continuing humanitarian needs of 
Darfur, for the establishment of a credible independent national human rights commission, 
and for programmes of compensation and redress for victims in Darfur.  Member States 
should also be prepared to prosecute individuals suspected of committing war crimes and 
crimes against humanity in Darfur through the exercise of universal jurisdiction in 
national courts outside of the Sudan. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) The international community should adopt a fully unified approach in 
addressing Darfur, supporting the joint efforts of the United Nations and African Union 
Envoys, and moving toward an expansion of the DPA process, to include all warring 
parties, as well as the representatives of civil society in Darfur.  Particular attention must 
be paid to engaging women and women&#8217;s organizations at all levels of the process. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) The international community should call for, support and facilitate the 
convening of a national conference on peace, human rights and a common vision for the 
Sudan, as proposed in paragraph (g), above. 
 (n) The international community should organize a regional conference, under 
the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union, with the participation of all 
neighbouring and other concerned States, on the safeguarding and promotion of peace and 
human rights in the region. </b></p>
