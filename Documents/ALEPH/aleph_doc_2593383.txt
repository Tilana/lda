CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
Forward-looking statements are included in this report and may be included in other public filings,
press releases, our website and oral and written presentations by management.  Statements other
than historical facts are forward-looking and may be identified by words such as “believe,”
“estimate,” “impact,” “intend,” “future,” “affect,” “expect,” “will,” “projected,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
“should,” “could,” “would,” variations of such words and words of similar meaning.  These
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties
and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict.  Therefore,
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such
forward-looking statements.  The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
forward-looking statements are changes in crude oil, natural gas liquids (“NGL”) and natural gas
prices, including further or sustained declines in the prices we receive for our production; risks and
uncertainties associated with the restructuring process, including our inability to develop, confirm
and consummate a plan under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or an alternative restructuring
transaction; inability to maintain our relationships with suppliers, customers, other third parties or
our employees as a result of the restructuring process; delays in planned or expected drilling;
changes in costs and availability of drilling, completion and production equipment and related
services and labor; the ability to obtain sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) necessary to
carry out enhanced oil recovery projects; the discovery of previously unknown environmental
issues; federal, state and local initiatives and efforts relating to the regulation of hydraulic
fracturing; the competitiveness of alternate energy sources or product substitutes; technological
developments; potential disruption or interruption of our net production due to accidents or severe
weather; the level of success in exploitation, development and production activities; the timing of
exploitation and development expenditures; inaccuracies of reserve estimates or assumptions
underlying them; revisions to reserve estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices;
impacts to financial statements as a result of impairment write-downs; risks related to level of
indebtedness; ability to continue to borrow under our debtor-in-possession credit agreement; ability
to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the internally funded portion of any capital
expenditures budget; changes in our business strategy; ability to obtain external capital to finance
exploitation and development operations and acquisitions; the potential need to sell certain assets,
restructure our debt or raise additional capital; our future levels of indebtedness, liquidity,
compliance with financial covenants and our ability to continue as a going concern; failure of
properties to yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities; ability to integrate
successfully the businesses we acquire; uninsured or underinsured losses resulting from oil and
natural gas operations; inability to access oil and natural gas markets due to market conditions or
operational impediments; the impact and costs of compliance with laws and regulations governing
oil and natural gas operations; changes in governmental regulations, including the regulation of
derivative instruments and the oil and natural gas industry; ability to replace oil and natural gas
reserves; any loss of senior management or technical personnel; competition in the oil and natural
gas industry; risks arising out of hedging transactions; the effects of changes in accounting rules
under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors
set forth under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” and Part I—Item
1A “—Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
(our “2015 Annual Report”), under Part II—Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2016 and under Part II—Item 1A of this report.  Unpredictable or unknown
factors not discussed herein also could have material adverse effects on forward-looking
statements.
All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this report and attributable to us
are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  This cautionary statement
should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking
statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (“2015 Annual Report”).  The financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair statement of our financial position at June 30, 2016, our operating results for
the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and our cash flows for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been included.  Operating results for the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  The consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that
date but does not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial
statements.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our 2015 Annual Report.
We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities.  Depletion,
depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) of proved oil and natural gas properties is computed using
the units-of-production method, net of any estimated residual salvage values.
Chapter 11 Cases
On May 15, 2016 (the “Chapter 11 Filing Date”), we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary
petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. See Note 2 for a discussion of the
bankruptcy proceedings.
Presentation
Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform
to the 2016 presentation. Other long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2015 was reported in our 2015 Annual Report as $2.9 million compared to $3.1 million in this
report due to $0.2 million in capital lease obligations that were segregated from other long-term
liabilities and reclassified to other long-term debt.
See Note 2 for a discussion of our liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern.
Change in Accounting Principle
In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The objective of
ASU 2015-03 is to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements by
presenting such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability
rather than as an asset.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Presentation and
Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.
Under ASU 2015-15, a company may defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit
arrangements and present such costs as an asset, subsequently amortizing the deferred debt
issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there
are any outstanding borrowings. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted these standards, which
required retroactive application and represented a change in accounting principle. The
unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately $37.0 million associated with our outstanding
senior notes, which were formerly presented as a component of other long-term assets on the
consolidated balance sheets, were reflected as a reduction to the carrying liability of our senior
notes. Debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility remained classified in other long-term
assets.

Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-
09 will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP and will require
entities to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The new standard also
requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand an entity’s nature, amount, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus
Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The update provides clarifications in
the assessment of principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue standard. In May
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. The update reduces the potential for
diversity in practice at initial application of Topic 606 and the cost and complexity of applying Topic
606. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and
Hedging: Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and
2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. This update
rescinds certain SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in Topic 605, Revenue
Recognition, and Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas, effective upon adoption of Topic
606. These ASUs are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
We are assessing the impact that the adoption of these standards will have on our consolidated
financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements — Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a
Going Concern. The amendments require management to perform interim and annual
assessments of whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt of an entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are
issued. Certain disclosures are required if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance is effective for annual periods ending
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, and with early adoption permitted. The
amendments will not impact our financial position or results of operations but will require
management to perform a formal going concern assessment. We are reviewing our policies and
procedures to ensure compliance with this new guidance.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-
10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments
provide guidance on financial instruments specifically related to (i) the classification and
measurement of investments in equity securities, (ii) the presentation of certain fair value changes
for financial liabilities measured at fair value and (iii) certain disclosure requirements associated
with the fair value of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. A cumulative-effect adjustment
to beginning retained earnings is required as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this ASU
is adopted. The adoption of this ASU will not have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
8
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires recognizing
a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. Lessees are permitted to make
an accounting policy to elect not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases with a
term of 12 months or less, and to recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. These new requirements become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the impact that ASU 2016-02
will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments simplify
certain areas of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including classification of
awards as either equity or liability, classification on the statement of cash flows, and election of
accounting policy to estimate forfeitures or recognize forfeitures when they occur. The amendments
are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is
permitted, however, adoption of all of the amendments are required in the same period of adoption.
We are assessing the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The objective of this update is to provide
more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and
other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The
amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP
with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader
range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. We are assessing the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated
financial statements.
2.  Chapter 11 Cases and Liquidity
Chapter 11 Cases
On May 15, 2016, we and 21 of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the
“Chapter 11 Petitions” and, the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 Cases are
being jointly administered under the caption In re Breitburn Energy Partners LP, et al, Case No. 16-
11390. No trustee has been appointed and we will continue to manage ourselves and our affiliates
and operate our businesses as “debtors in possession” subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of
the Bankruptcy Court. To assure ordinary course operations, we received approval from the
Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions that authorize us to maintain
our existing cash management system, to secure debtor-in-possession financing and other
customary relief. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, Breitburn Operating LP (“BOLP”)
entered into the Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2016, among itself,
as borrower, Breitburn Energy Partners LP, as parent guarantor, the financial institutions from time
to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swing
line lender and issuing lender (the “DIP Credit Agreement”). See Note 8 for a discussion of the DIP
Credit Agreement.
ASC 852-10, Reorganizations, applies to entities that have filed a petition for relief under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In accordance with ASC 852-10, transactions and events directly
associated with the reorganization are required to be distinguished from the ongoing operations of
the business. In addition, the guidance requires changes in the accounting and presentation of
liabilities, as well as expenses and income directly associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in the acceleration of the Debtors’
obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2016,
among BOLP, as borrower, Breitburn Energy Partners LP, as parent guarantor, the lenders from
time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent,
swing line lender and issuing lender (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), and the indentures
governing our 9.25% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 (“Senior Secured Notes”), our
8.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (“2020 Senior Notes”) and our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2022
(“2022 Senior Notes,” and together with the 2020 Senior Notes, the “Senior Unsecured Notes”).
Any efforts to enforce such obligations are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the
Chapter 11 Petitions and the holders’ rights of enforcement in respect of these obligations are
subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. See Note 8 for a discussion of our
Credit Agreement (which has been reclassified from
9
long-term debt to current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets) and our
Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes (which have been reclassified from long-term
debt to liabilities subject to compromise on our consolidated balance sheets).
We are making adequate protection payments with respect to the Credit Agreement, reflected in
interest expense, net of capitalized interest on the consolidated statements of operations,
consisting of the payment of interest (at the default rate) and the payment of all reasonable fees
and expenses provided for in the Credit Agreement. We are also making adequate protection
payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes in the form of the payment of all reasonable
fees and expenses of professionals retained by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases also resulted in a termination right by counterparties
on our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 4 for a discussion of the
derivative instruments, which were terminated, and resulted in $458.8 million in estimated hedge
settlements receivable and $3.9 million in estimated hedge settlements payable, reflected in
accounts and other receivables, net and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheets, respectively.
Effect of Filing on Creditors and Unitholders
On April 14, 2016, we elected to suspend the declaration of any further distributions on our Series
A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Series A Preferred Units”) and Series B
Perpetual Convertible Preferred Units (“Series B Preferred Units”). In addition, we elected to defer
a $33.5 million interest payment due with respect to our 2022 Senior Notes and a $13.2 million
interest payment due with respect to our 2020 Senior Notes, with each such interest payment due
on April 15, 2016 and subject to a 30-day grace period. As a consequence of the commencement
of the Chapter 11 Cases, such interest payments have not been made, and are classified as
liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016.
On May 15, 2016, we filed the Chapter 11 Petitions. Under the priority scheme established by the
Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and post-petition
liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B
Preferred Units and common units representing limited partner interests in us (“Common Units”)
are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The
ultimate recovery to creditors and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. No assurance can be given as to what
distributions, if any, will be made to each of these constituencies or the nature thereof. As
discussed below, if certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met, a plan of reorganization
can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection or deemed rejection by the holders of our Series A
Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units and notwithstanding the fact that
such holders do not receive or retain any property on account of their equity interests under the
plan. Because of such possibilities, the value of our securities, including our Series A Preferred
Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units, is highly speculative. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and
Common Units will retain any value under a plan of reorganization.
Executory Contracts. Subject to certain exceptions, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may
assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, subject to the approval
of the Bankruptcy Court. The rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is generally
treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to
certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such executory
contract or unexpired lease but may give rise to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for
damages caused by such deemed breach. The assumption of an executory contract or unexpired
lease generally requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary defaults under such executory
contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance.
Process for Plan of Reorganization. In order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11, the Debtors
will need to obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of a plan of reorganization that satisfies
the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization generally provides for the
treatment and satisfaction of pre-petition obligations and equity interests and provides for the
means by which the plan of reorganization will be implemented.
Debtors Condensed Combined Financial Statements. Two of our subsidiaries, ETSWDC and
Breitburn Collingwood Utica LLC, are non-debtors (“Non-Debtors”). Accordingly, these entities will
be accounted for under GAAP for entities not in bankruptcy and outside the scope of ASC 852. The
Non-Debtors are minor subsidiaries, and, as such, we have not presented Debtors Condensed
Combined Financial Statements.
10
Costs of Reorganization
The Debtors have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the Chapter
11 Cases. The amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, are expected to
significantly affect our results. The following table summarizes the components included in
reorganization items, net on our consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016:

We use this category to reflect the net expenses and gains and losses that are the result of the
reorganization and restructuring of the business. Professional fees included in reorganization
items, net represent professional fees for post-petition expenses. Deferred financing costs and
unamortized discounts are related to the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes
(together, the “Senior Notes”), and are included in reorganization items, net as we believe these
debt instruments will be impacted by the Chapter 11 Cases. As of June 30, 2016, we had $5.8
million of accrued reorganization costs included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance
sheet.
Liabilities Subject to Compromise
Our consolidated financial statements include in liabilities subject to compromise pre-petition
liabilities that may be affected by the plan of reorganization at the amounts expected to be allowed,
even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. 
If there is uncertainty about whether a secured claim is under-secured, or will be impaired under
the plan of reorganization, the entire amount of the claim is included in liabilities subject to
compromise. Differences between liabilities we have estimated and the claims to be filed will be
investigated and resolved in connection with the claims resolution process. We will continue to
evaluate these liabilities throughout the Chapter 11 Cases and adjust amounts as necessary. Such
adjustments may be material.
Our consolidated financial statements include amounts classified as liabilities subject to
compromise that we believe the Bankruptcy Court will allow as claim amounts resulting from the
Debtors’ rejection of various executory contracts and unexpired leases and defaults under the debt
agreements. Additional amounts may be included in liabilities subject to compromise in future
periods if other executory contracts and unexpired leases are rejected. Conversely, the Debtors
expect that the assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases may convert
certain liabilities shown in future financial statements as subject to compromise to post-petition
liabilities. Due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential claims, the magnitude of such claims
is not reasonably estimable at this time. Such claims may be material. The following table
summarizes the components of liabilities subject to compromise included in our consolidated
balance sheets as of June 30, 2016:

Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
As a result of sustained losses and the Chapter 11 Cases, the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership, are subject to
uncertainty. Given uncertainty surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated interim financial
statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the Chapter 11 Cases. In
particular, the consolidated financial statements do not purport to show (i) as to assets, their
realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (ii) as to pre-petition
liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or the status and priority
thereof; (iii) as to unitholders’ equity accounts, the effect of any changes that may be made in our
capitalization; or (iv) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made to our business.
While operating as debtors in possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors
may sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities in amounts other than those
reflected in our consolidated interim financial statements, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business. Further, a plan of reorganization
could materially change the amounts and classifications in our historical consolidated interim
financial statements.
Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court, we are making adequate protection payments with
respect to the Credit Agreement consisting of the payment of interest (at the default rate), included
in interest expense, net of capitalized interest on the consolidated statements of operations, and
the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses provided for in the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to
such order, we are also making adequate protection payments with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes in the form of the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses of professionals retained by
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.
3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
2016 Acquisitions and Dispositions
In March 2016, we completed the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets (the “Mid-Continent
Sale”) for net proceeds of $11.8 million. The sale included all Mid-Continent properties acquired in
the merger with QR Energy, LP (“QRE”) in 2014, excluding five wells for which we have asset
retirement obligations and over-riding royalty interests and royalty interests in an additional 42
wells. This transaction was effective January 1, 2016. We recognized a gain of $12.3 million from
the Mid-Continent Sale.
In January 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase CO2 assets in Harding County, New
Mexico for a total purchase price of $3.9 million. We acquired compression, dehydration, and
electrical sub-station facilities, all associated surface leases and contracts related to the facilities,
and six existing producing wells associated with the leases and gathering lines.
2015 Acquisitions
In May 2015, we completed the acquisition of additional interests in our existing fields located in
Ark-La-Tex for a total purchase price of $3.4 million, which is primarily reflected in oil and natural
gas properties on the consolidated balance sheet.
In March 2015, we completed the acquisition of certain CO2 producing properties located in
Harding County, New Mexico, primarily reflected in property, plant and equipment on the
consolidated balance sheets, for a total purchase price of $70.5 million, of which $13.7 million was
paid in cash during the three months ended March 31, 2015.
4.  Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
 
Our risk management programs were intended to reduce our exposure to commodity price
volatilities and to assist with stabilizing cash flows and distributions.  Routinely in the past, we
utilized derivative financial instruments to reduce this volatility. To the extent we entered into
economic hedges for a significant portion of our expected production through commodity derivative
instruments and the cost for goods and services increased, our margins would have been
adversely affected. As discussed below, our commodity derivative transactions were terminated in
the second quarter of 2016.
12
Chapter 11 Cases
The filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions triggered an event of default under each of the agreements
governing our derivative transactions (“ISDA Agreements”). As a result, our counterparties were
permitted to terminate, and did terminate, all outstanding transactions governed by the ISDA
Agreements. The termination date for each outstanding transaction is the termination date
specified to us by our counterparties.
The derivative transactions are no longer accounted for at fair value under ASC 815, because they
were terminated in connection with our filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and have been evaluated
as receivables or payables at termination value. At the termination dates, expected settlement
receipts on terminated contracts were reclassified from current and long-term derivative instrument
assets to accounts and other receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets and expected
settlement payments on terminated contracts were reclassified from current and long-term
derivative instrument liabilities to other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of
June 30, 2016, we had $458.8 million of estimated hedge settlements receivable and $3.9 million
in estimated hedge settlements payable, reflected in accounts and other receivables, net and other
current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
All of our derivative counterparties are also lenders, or affiliates of lenders, under our Credit
Agreement (see Note 8). In accordance with the interim order approving the DIP Credit Agreement
(the “Interim Order”), our counterparties were permitted to terminate any outstanding derivative
transactions and to calculate the amounts due to or from the Debtors as a result of such
terminations, in accordance with the terms of the governing agreements. However, each such
counterparty is required to hold any proceeds due to the Debtors in a book entry account
maintained by the counterparty until the date that is the earlier of (the “Standstill Termination Date”)
(i) the date the Bankruptcy Court approves in a final order a mutually acceptable resolution among
the parties involved with regard to the disposition of the proceeds, (ii) three business days after the
date counsel to the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement notifies in writing counsel to
the Debtors that the administrative agent intends to provide consent to the counterparties to set off
any obligations under the Credit Agreement and (c) the date that is 60 days from the date of entry of
the Interim Order. On July 19, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Amended Interim Order (“DIP
Amended Interim Order”) extending the Standstill Termination Date (see Note 16). Pursuant to the
Interim Order, the rights of all of the parties are reserved as to the ultimate disposition of the
proceeds. The Credit Agreement is fully collateralized, and excluded from liabilities subject to
compromise. Therefore, settlement payables due to our counterparties are reflected in accounts
payable on the consolidated balance sheets rather than in liabilities subject to compromise.
As discussed above, our derivative instruments are no longer presented at fair value.
The following table presents the fair value of our derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments at December 31, 2015:

Fair Value Measurements
FASB Accounting Standards define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and
establish required disclosures about fair value measurements.  They also establish a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels based upon how
observable those inputs are.  We use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and obtain the majority of our inputs from published objective sources or third-party market
participants.  We incorporate the impact of nonperformance risk, including credit risk, into our fair
value measurements.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority of Level 1 to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority of Level 3 to
unobservable inputs.  We categorize our fair value financial instruments based upon the objectivity
of the inputs and how observable those inputs are.  The three levels of inputs are described further
as follows:
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date.  Level 2 – Inputs that are observable other than quoted prices that are included
within Level 1.  Level 2 includes financial instruments that are actively traded but are valued using
models or other valuation methodologies.  We consider the over-the-counter (“OTC”) commodity
and interest rate swaps in our portfolio to be Level 2.  Level 3 – Inputs that are not directly
observable for the asset or liability and are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.  Level
3 includes financial instruments that are not actively traded and have little or no observable data for
input into industry standard models.  Certain OTC derivative instruments that trade in less liquid
markets or contain limited observable model inputs are currently included in Level 3.  As of
December 31, 2015, our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consisted entirely of OTC
commodity put and call options.
Financial assets and liabilities that are categorized in Level 3 may later be reclassified to the
Level 2 category at the point we are able to obtain sufficient binding market data.  We had no
transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015. Our policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the end of the period.
Our assessment of the significance of an input to its fair value measurement requires judgment
and can affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities as well as the category within which they
are classified.
Derivative Instruments
We calculate the fair value of our commodity and interest rate swaps and options.  We compare
these fair value amounts to the fair value amounts we receive from counterparties on a monthly
basis.  Any differences are resolved and any required changes are recorded prior to the issuance
of our financial statements.
The models we utilize to calculate the fair value of our Level 2 and Level 3 commodity derivative
instruments are standard pricing models. Level 2 inputs to the pricing models include the terms of
our derivative contracts, commodity
14
prices from commodity forward price curves, volatility and interest rate factors and time to expiry.
Model inputs are obtained from independent third party data providers and our counterparties and
are verified to published data where available (e.g., NYMEX). Additional inputs to our Level 3
derivatives include option volatilities, forward commodity prices and risk-free interest rates for
present value discounting. We use the standard swap contract valuation method to value our
interest rate derivatives, and inputs include LIBOR forward interest rates, one-month LIBOR rates
and risk-free interest rates for present value discounting.
Assumed credit risk adjustments, based on published credit ratings and credit default swap rates,
are applied to our derivative instruments.
The fair value of the commodity and interest rate derivative instruments that were novated to us in
connection with our merger with QRE are estimated using a combined income and market
valuation methodology based upon futures commodity prices and volatility curves. The curves are
obtained from independent pricing services reflecting broker market quotes. We validate the data
provided by independent pricing services by comparing such pricing against other third party
pricing data.
Available-for-Sale Securities
The fair value of our available for sale securities are estimated using actual trade data,
broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices,
independent pricing vendors, or other sources. We validate the data provided by independent
pricing services to make assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of its
investment portfolio by comparing such pricing against other third party pricing data. We consider
the inputs to the valuation of our available for sale securities to be Level 1.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
accounts receivable, including hedge settlements receivable. Our hedge settlements receivable
expose us to credit risk from counterparties. As of June 30, 2016, our hedge settlements receivable
were due from Bank of Montreal, Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, Citibank, N.A, Comerica Bank, Credit Suisse Energy LLC, Credit Suisse International,
ING Capital Markets LLC, Fifth Third Bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., Merrill Lynch
Commodities, Inc., Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., PBN Bank, N.A, Royal Bank of Canada,
The Bank of Nova Scotia, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Union Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. Our counterparties are all lenders, or affiliates of lenders, that participate in our Credit
Agreement. Our Credit Agreement is secured by our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, so we are
not required to post any collateral, and we conversely do not receive collateral from our
counterparties. On all transactions where we are exposed to counterparty risk, we analyze the
counterparty’s financial condition and obtain credit default swap information on our counterparties.
This risk was managed by diversifying our derivatives portfolio.  As of June 30, 2016, each of these
financial institutions had an investment grade credit rating.
5.  Related Party Transactions
Breitburn Management Company LLC (“Breitburn Management”), our wholly-owned subsidiary,
operates our assets and performs other administrative services for us such as accounting,
corporate development, finance, land administration, legal and engineering.  All of our employees,
including our executives, are employees of Breitburn Management.
Breitburn Management also provided administrative services to Pacific Coast Energy Company
LP, formerly named BreitBurn Energy Company L.P. (“PCEC”), our predecessor, under an
administrative services agreement (“Administrative Services Agreement”), in exchange for a
monthly fee for indirect expenses and reimbursement for all direct expenses, including incentive
compensation plan costs and direct payroll and administrative costs related to PCEC properties
and operations.  For each of the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
monthly fee paid by PCEC for indirect expenses was $700,000. On February 5, 2016, PCEC
provided written notice to Breitburn Management of its intention to terminate the Administrative
Services Agreement, which became effective on June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a current receivable of $0.4 million and $1.7
million, respectively, due from PCEC related to the administrative services agreement and
employee-related costs.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the monthly
charges to PCEC for indirect expenses totaled 2.1 million in each period, and charges for direct
expenses including payroll and administrative costs totaled $2.4 million and $2.2 million,
respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the monthly charges to PCEC for
indirect expenses totaled $4.2 million in each period, and charges for direct expenses including
payroll and administrative costs totaled $4.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively. At June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, we had receivables of $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively,
due from certain of our other affiliates, primarily representing investments in natural gas processing
facilities, for management fees due from them and operational expenses incurred on their behalf.

6. Impairments
Long-Lived Assets
We review our oil and gas properties for impairment periodically or when events or circumstances
indicate that their carrying amounts may exceed their fair values and may not be recoverable.
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, the carrying amount of an oil and gas property
to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property. Determination as to
whether and how much an asset is impaired involves subjectivity and management estimates on
highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles and expected reserve lives, the outlook
for market supply and demand conditions for oil and natural gas, management’s intent to hold and
use the properties and other factors.
       
For purposes of assessing our oil and gas properties for potential impairment, management
reviews the expected undiscounted future cash flows for our total proved and, in certain instances,
risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves on a held and used basis based in large part on
future capital and operating plans. The undiscounted cash flow review includes inputs such as
applicable NYMEX forward strip prices, estimated basis price differentials, expenses and capital
estimates, and escalation factors.  Management also considers the impact future price changes are
likely to have on our future operating plans.
If we determine that an impairment charge for a property is warranted, an impairment charge is
recorded for the amount that the property’s carrying value exceeds the amount of its estimated
discounted future net cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the estimated discounted
future cash flows were determined by using applicable basis adjusted (i) nine-year NYMEX
forward strip prices for oil, and (ii) ten-year NYMEX forward strip prices for natural gas, in each
case, at the end of the reporting period, and escalated along with expenses and capital starting in
(i) year ten for oil and (ii) year eleven for natural gas, and thereafter at 2% per year.  Production and
development cost estimates (e.g. operating expenses and development capital) are conformed to
reflect the commodity price strip used.  The associated property’s expected future net cash flows
are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate, which approximated
11% at March 31, 2016. There were no impairments during the three months ended June 30,
2016.  We consider the inputs for our impairment calculations to be Level 3 inputs.  The impairment
reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans.
There were no impairments during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Non-cash impairment
charges totaled $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, including $2.1 million in the
Southeast, $0.5 million in the Permian Basin and $0.2 million in the Rockies, primarily related to
the impact that the drop in commodity strip prices in the out years had on projected future revenues
for certain of our lower margin properties. There were no impairments during the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Impairments totaled $59.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015,
including $33.1 million in the Permian Basin, $16.7 million in the Rockies and $9.3 million in Mid-
Continent.
       
Management prepared its undiscounted cash flow estimates on a held and used basis which
assumes oil and gas properties will be held and used for their economic lives. If a decision is
reached to sell a particular asset, that asset would be classified as held for sale and could
potentially be impaired if the estimated sales value less the costs of disposal exceeded its carrying
value. It is also possible that further periods of prolonged lower commodity prices, future declines
in commodity prices, changes to our future plans in response to a final plan of reorganization, or
increases in operating costs could result in future impairments. Given the number of assumptions
involved in the estimates, an estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other
assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and calculations is not practicable. Favorable
changes to some assumptions could have increased the undiscounted cash flows thus further
avoiding the need to impair any assets in this period, whereas unfavorable changes could have
caused an unknown number of assets to become impaired.

DIP Credit Agreement
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, BOLP entered into the DIP Credit Agreement as
borrower with the lenders party thereto (the “DIP Lenders”) and Wells Fargo, National Association,
as administrative agent. The Debtors have guaranteed all obligations under the DIP Credit
Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the DIP Credit Agreement, the DIP Lenders have made
available a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million (and the DIP
Lenders have offered to arrange an additional $75 million of financing under the DIP Credit
Agreement at the borrower’s request), which includes a letter of credit facility available for the
issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount not to
19
exceed a sub-limit of $50 million, and a swingline facility in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed a sub-limit of $5 million, in each case, to mature on the earlier to occur of (A) the effective
date of a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases or (B) the stated maturity of the DIP Credit
Agreement of January 15, 2017. In addition, the maturity date may be accelerated upon the
occurrence of certain events as set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement.
At June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the DIP Credit Agreement.
The proceeds of the DIP Credit Agreement may be used: (i) to pay the costs and expenses of
administering the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) to fund our working capital needs, capital improvements,
and other general corporate purposes, in each case, in accordance with an agreed budget and (iii)
to provide adequate protection to existing secured creditors.
Acceleration of Debt Obligations
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in the acceleration of the Debtors’
obligations under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of all obligations with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. Any efforts to enforce such obligations are
automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and the holders’ rights of
enforcement in respect of these obligations are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.
Credit Agreement
At each of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion in indebtedness outstanding
under the Credit Agreement.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our borrowing base was $1.8 billion. On March 28,
2016, we entered into a Consent (the “Consent”) to the Credit Agreement, which delayed the
scheduled borrowing base redetermination from April 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016 and reduced the
elected commitment amount under the Credit Agreement from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion. During the
three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $15.7 million for the write-off of debt issuance
costs related to the reduction of the elected commitment amount under our Credit Agreement.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $20.4 million or the write-off of debt
issuance costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases. These write-offs are reflected in our interest
expense totals.
 
As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, we had $1.197 billion in unpaid principal outstanding under the
Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on
substantially all of the Debtors’ assets, including the proceeds thereof and after-acquired property.
Therefore, upon the acceleration as a consequence of the commencement of the Chapter 11
Cases, we reclassified the Credit Agreement balance to current portion of long-term debt, as the
principal became immediately due and payable. However, any efforts to enforce such payment
obligations are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions. As of the
Chapter 11 Filing Date, we recognized $15.7 million for the full write-off of unamortized debt
issuance costs related to the Credit Agreement.
We are required to make adequate protection payments to the lenders under the Credit Agreement,
which includes interest at the default rate as provided in the Credit Agreement. We are recognizing
the default interest accrued on the Credit Agreement as interest expense, net of capitalized interest
on the consolidated statements of operations, and we are recognizing the adequate protection
payments as accrued interest payable on the consolidated balance sheets, rather than in liabilities
subject to compromise. At June 30, 2016, the default interest rate on the Credit Agreement was
6.75%.
Senior Secured Notes
As of March 31, 2016, we had $650 million of Senior Secured Notes, issued on April 5, 2015,
which had a carrying value of $614.1 million, net of unamortized discount of $16.5 million and
unamortized debt issuance costs of $19.4 million. Interest on our Senior Secured Notes is payable
quarterly in March, June, September and December.
Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on May 15, 2016, no interest has been paid to
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As of June 30, 2016, the Senior Secured Notes were
reflected as liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet, with the carrying
value equal to the face value of the notes. The unamortized discount of $16.1 million and the
unamortized debt issuance costs of $18.9 million as of the Chapter 11 Filing Date were expensed
and recognized in reorganization items, net on the consolidated statements of operations. In
addition, as of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, the accrued but unpaid interest expense on the Senior
Secured Notes of $7.5 million was reflected as liabilities subject
20
to compromise. No interest expense was recognized on the Senior Secured Notes after the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. Unrecognized, contractual interest expense on the
Senior Secured Notes for each of the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $7.5
million.
Senior Unsecured Notes
As of March 31, 2016, we had $305 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Senior Notes,
which had a carrying value of $298.2 million, net of unamortized discount of $2.8 million and
unamortized debt issuance costs of $4.0 million. In addition, as of March 31, 2016, we had $850
million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Senior Notes, which had a carrying value of $842.6
million, net of unamortized premium of $4.3 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of $11.7
million. Interest on the 2020 Senior Notes and the 2022 Senior Notes is payable twice a year in
April and October.
On April 14, 2016, we elected to defer a $33.5 million interest payment due with respect to our
2022 Senior Notes and a $13.2 million interest payment due with respect to our 2020 Senior
Notes, with each such interest payment due on April 15, 2016 and subject to a 30-day grace
period. As a consequence of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, such interest payments
have not been made, and are classified as liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated
balance sheet at June 30, 2016.
Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on May 15, 2016, no interest has been paid to
the holders of the Senior Unsecured Notes. As of June 30, 2016, the Senior Unsecured Notes
were reflected as liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet, with the
carrying values equal to the face values of the notes. The unamortized premium of $1.5 million and
the unamortized debt issuance costs of $15.4 million as of the Chapter 11 Filing Date were
recognized in reorganization items, net on the consolidated statements of operations. In addition,
as of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, the accrued but unpaid interest expense on the Senior Unsecured
Notes of $54.4 million was reflected as liabilities subject to compromise. No interest expense was
recognized on the Senior Unsecured Notes after the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions.
Unrecognized contractual interest expense on the Senior Unsecured Notes for each of the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $11.7 million.

9. Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements
We and Breitburn Finance Corporation (and BOLP, with respect to the Senior Secured Notes), as
co-issuers, and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, issued the Senior Notes. All but two of
our subsidiaries have guaranteed the Senior Notes, and our only non-guarantor subsidiaries,
Breitburn Collingwood Utica LLC and ETSWDC, are minor subsidiaries.
In accordance with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, we are not presenting condensed consolidating
financial statements as we have no independent assets or operations; Breitburn Finance
Corporation, the subsidiary co-issuer that does not guarantee the Senior Notes, is a wholly-owned
finance subsidiary; all of our material subsidiaries are wholly-owned and have guaranteed the
Senior Notes; and all of the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several.
    
Each guarantee of each of the Senior Notes is subject to release in the following customary
circumstances:
(1)
(2)
a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the guarantor subsidiary (including by way of
merger or consolidation) to a third person, provided the disposition complies with the applicable
indenture,
a disposition of the capital stock of the guarantor subsidiary to a third person, if the disposition
complies with the applicable indenture and as a result the guarantor subsidiary ceases to be our
subsidiary,
(3)the designation by us of the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary,
legal or covenant defeasance of such series of Senior Notes or satisfaction and discharge of the
(4)
related indenture,
the liquidation or dissolution of the guarantor subsidiary, provided no default under the
applicable indenture exists, or
(5)
(6)
the guarantor subsidiary ceases both (a) to guarantee any other indebtedness of ours or any
other guarantor subsidiary and (b) to be an obligor under any bank credit facility.
10.  Asset Retirement Obligations
ARO is based on our net ownership in wells and facilities and our estimate of the costs to abandon
and remediate those wells and facilities together with our estimate of the future timing of the costs
to be incurred.  Payments to settle ARO occur over the operating lives of the assets, estimated to
range from less than one year to 50 years.  Estimated cash flows for any new additions or revisions
have been discounted at a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of approximately 14% for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate at December 31, 2015 was 14%, and
adjusted for inflation using a rate of 2%.  Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate is calculated based on
our cost of borrowing adjusted for the effect of our credit standing and specific industry and
business risk.
We consider the inputs to our ARO valuation to be Level 3, as fair value is determined using
discounted cash flow methodologies based on standardized inputs that are not readily observable
in public markets.

11.  Commitments and Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, we have performance obligations that are secured, in whole or
in part, by surety bonds or letters of credit. These obligations primarily relate to abandonments,
environmental and other responsibilities where governmental and other organizations require such
support. These surety bonds and letters of credit are issued by financial institutions and are
required to be reimbursed by us if drawn upon.  At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had
approximately $29 million and $27 million, respectively, of surety bonds outstanding. At June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $45.0 million and $25.8 million, respectively,
in letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Agreement. The increase in letters of credit during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the Chapter 11 filing.  At June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we had approximately and $1.8 million and zero, respectively, in letters of
credit outstanding under our DIP Credit Agreement.
Legal Proceedings
Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our
operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party to any material legal
proceedings.
12.  Partners’ Equity
Effect of Filing on Unitholders
Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise,
pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our
Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units are entitled to receive any
distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors
and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or
plans of reorganization. No assurance can be given as to what distributions, if any, will be made to
each of these constituencies or the nature thereof. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code
are met, a plan of reorganization can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection or deemed
rejection by the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common
Units and notwithstanding the fact that such holders do not receive or retain any property on
account of their equity interests under the plan. Because of such possibilities, the value of our
securities, including our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units, is
highly speculative. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the holders of our Series A
Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units will retain any value under a plan of
reorganization.
Preferred Units
On May 21, 2014, we sold 8.0 million Series A Preferred Units in a public offering at a price of
$25.00 per Series A Preferred Unit, resulting in proceeds of $193.2 million net of underwriting
discount and offering expenses of $6.8 million. The Series A Preferred Units rank senior to our
Common Units and on parity with the Series B Preferred Units with respect to the payment of
distributions. Through March 31, 2016, we paid cumulative distributions in cash on the Series A
Preferred Units on a monthly basis at a monthly rate of $0.171875 per Series A Preferred Unit,
totaling $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
On April 8, 2015, we issued in a private offering $350 million of Series B Preferred Units at an
issue price of $7.50 per unit. We received approximately $337.2 million from this offering, net of
fees and estimated expenses, which we primarily used to repay borrowings under our credit
facility. The Series B Preferred Units rank senior to our Common Units and on parity with the
Series A Preferred Units with respect to the payment of distributions.
On April 14, 2016, we elected to suspend the declaration of any further distributions on our Series
A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units. As of Chapter 11 Filing Date, we had 8 million
Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding and 49.6 million Series B Preferred Units issued
and outstanding. We will continue to account for our Series A Preferred Units and Series B
Preferred Units at their carrying value until a plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court and becomes effective. We accrued for earned but undeclared distributions on each series of
Preferred Units for the period from April 1, 2016 to the Chapter 11 Filing Date. As of the Chapter 11
Filing Date, total accrued but unpaid distributions on our Series A Preferred Units and Series B
Preferred Units of $6.4 million were reflected as liabilities subject to compromise.
23
Through the three months ended March 31, 2016, we elected to pay our Series B Preferred Unit
distributions in kind by issuing additional Series B Preferred Units (or, when elected by the
unitholder, by issuing Common Units in lieu of such Series B Preferred Units) instead of cash.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we declared distributions on our Series B
Preferred Units at a monthly rate of 0.006666 Series B Preferred Units per unit, in the form of a total
of 818,626 Series B Preferred Units and 163,314 Common Units. During each of the three months
and six months ended June 30, 2015, we declared distributions on our Series B Preferred Units at
a monthly rate of 0.006666 Series B Preferred Units per unit, in the form of a total of 575,291 Series
B Preferred Units and 121,584 Common Units.
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we recognized
$3.7 million and $11.1 million, $6.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of accrued distributions
on the Series B Preferred Units, which were included in non-cash distributions to Series B
preferred unitholders on the consolidated statements of operations. During the three months and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we recognized $2.0 million, $6.1 million, $4.1
million and $8.3 million, respectively, of accrued distributions on the Series A Preferred Units,
which were included in distributions to Series A preferred unitholders on the consolidated
statements of operations.
Common Units
As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, we had 213.8 million Common Units outstanding. We will
continue to account for our Common Units at their carrying value until a plan of reorganization is
confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and becomes effective.
At each of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately 213.8 million and 213.5
million, respectively, of Common Units outstanding.
In 2016, we declared no cash distributions to holders of our Common Units and our restricted
phantom units (“RPUs”). In response to current commodity and financial market conditions, the
Board of Directors of our general partner (the “Board”) suspended distributions on Common Units
effective with the third monthly payment attributable to the third quarter of 2015. During the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2015, we paid cash distributions of approximately $26.4
million, or $0.1250 per Common Unit, and $79.1 million, or $0.3749 per Common Unit,
respectively.
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued zero and 163,314
Common Units, respectively, to a Series B Preferred unitholder that elected to receive its paid in
kind distributions in Common Units. During each of the three months and six months ended
June 30, 2015, we issued 121,584 Common Units to a Series B Preferred unitholder that elected to
receive its paid in kind distributions in Common Units.
During each of the three months June 30, 2016 and 2015, we issued zero Common Units to non-
employee directors for RPUs. During each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
issued less than 0.1 million Common Units to non-employee directors for RPUs that vested in
January 2016 and January 2015.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were approximately 20.7 million and 3.6 million,
respectively, of units outstanding under our long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) that were eligible to
be paid in Common Units upon vesting.
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, we paid zero in cash at a rate equal
to the distributions paid to our holders of Common Units to holders of outstanding unvested RPUs
issued under our LTIP. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015, we paid
$0.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in cash at a rate equal to the distributions paid to our
holders of Common Units to holders of outstanding unvested RPUs issued under our LTIP.
Earnings per Common Unit
FASB Accounting Standards require use of the “two-class” method of computing earnings per unit
for all periods presented.  The “two-class” method is an earnings allocation formula that determines
earnings per unit for each class of common unit and participating security as if all earnings for the
period had been distributed.  Unvested restricted unit awards that earn non-forfeitable dividend
rights qualify as participating securities and, accordingly, are included in the basic
computation.  Our unvested RPUs and convertible phantom units (“CPUs”) participate in
distributions on an equal basis with Common Units.  Accordingly, the presentation below is
prepared on a combined basis and is presented as net loss per common unit.

The following is a reconciliation of net loss and weighted average units for calculating basic net

14.  Unit and Other Valuation-Based Compensation Plans
For detailed information on our various compensation plans, see Note 18 to the consolidated
financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report.
Restricted Phantom Units and Convertible Phantom Units
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Board approved the grant of
zero and 4.4 million, respectively, RPUs to the executives and certain key employees of Breitburn
Management and zero and 0.5 million, respectively, to outside directors, which vest one-half after
30 months and the other one-half after 36 months. The grant date fair value of the RPUs granted
was $0.68 per unit.
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded unit-based
compensation expense for the outstanding RPUs and CPUs of $4.8 million and $10.1 million,
respectively, of which $0.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, was included in operating costs,
$3.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively, was included in general and administrative expenses,
and $0.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, was included in restructuring costs on the
consolidated statements of operations. During the three months and six months ended June 30,
2015, we recorded unit-based compensation expense of $6.8 million and $14.5 million,
respectively, of which $6.1 million and $13.0 million, respectively, was included in general and
administrative expenses and $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, was included in
restructuring costs on the consolidated statement of operations. See Note 15 for a discussion of
restructuring costs. As of June 30, 2016, there was $16.8 million of unrecognized compensation
cost related to our unit based compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over the
period from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.
Phantom Units
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Board approved the grant of
zero and 10.4 million phantom units (“Phantom Units”), respectively, at $0.68 per unit, to the
executives and certain key employees of Breitburn Management and zero and 0.5 million Phantom
Units, respectively, to outside directors. Phantom Units vest one-half after 18 months and one-half
after 24 months and are settled in cash (or Common Units if elected by us). Upon vesting, each
outstanding and vested unit equal shall receive the fair market value of one Common Unit, with a
minimum cash value of $0.50 per Phantom Unit with respect to certain employees. The minimum
cash value requirement was canceled in April 2016 in regards to certain employees. The Phantom
Units are accounted for as a liability and remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting
period, with the changes to fair value recognized over the vesting period.
26
The fair market value of the Phantom Units was $0.08 per unit at June 30, 2016. During the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a credit of $0.5 million and a charge of
$0.2 million to compensation expense for the Phantom Units, respectively, of which a credit of $0.4
million and a charge of $0.2 million, respectively were included in operating costs, and credits of
$0.1 million and zero, respectively, were included in general and administrative expenses on the
consolidated statement of operations. As of June 30, 2016, there was $0.6 million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested Phantom Units, which is expected to be recognized over
the period from July 1, 2016 to January 1, 2018.
Key Employee Plan
In April, 2016, the Partnership adopted the Key Employee Program (“KEP”). Participants must be
employed on the scheduled payment dates in order to receive a payment under the KEP.
Participants in the KEP are eligible to receive quarterly cash payments, which are contingent on
meeting performance thresholds tied to production and lease operating expense and satisfactory
individual performance. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $2.5 million in
general and administrative expenses and $1.5 million in operating costs, related to the 2016 KEP.
15.  Restructuring Costs
During the first half of 2016 and 2015, we executed workforce reduction plans as part of company-
wide reorganization efforts intended to reduce costs, due in part to lower commodity prices. In
addition, we executed workforce reductions in the first half of 2016 in connection with the notice
received from PCEC on February 5, 2016 of its intention to terminate the administrative services
agreement with Breitburn Management, effective as of June 30, 2016 (see Note 5 for a discussion
of the administrative services agreement).
In connection with the reductions in workforce, we incurred total costs of approximately $2.4
million, $5.2 million, $1.8 million and $6.7 million during the three months and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which included severance cash payments, accelerated
vesting of LTIP grants for certain individuals and other employee-related termination costs. The
2016 reductions were communicated to affected employees on various dates during the six months
ended June 30, 2016, and all such notifications were completed by June 30, 2016. The 2015
reduction was communicated to affected employees on various dates during March 2015, and all
such notifications were completed by March 31, 2015. The plans resulted in a reduction of 12
employees, 69 employees, zero employees and 37 employees, respectively, for the three months
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. In connection with the 2016 reductions, we expect
our total cost to be approximately $5.4 million, of which $5.2 million was incurred in the first six
months of 2016, which included severance cash payments, accelerated vesting of LTIP grants for
certain individuals and other employee-related termination costs. At June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 we had restructuring costs payable of $2.3 million and zero, respectively.
During each of the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, we made restructuring
payments of $2.9 million.

See Note 2, “Chapter 11 Cases and Liquidity,” for details on the Debtors’ cases under Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code. On July 19, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the DIP Amended Interim
Order extending the Standstill Termination Date. Pursuant to the DIP Amended Interim Order, each
of our derivative counterparties is required to hold any proceeds due to the Debtors in a book entry
account maintained by the counterparty until the date that is the earlier of (i) the date the
Bankruptcy Court approves in a final order a mutually acceptable resolution among the parties
involved with regard to the disposition of the proceeds, (ii) three business days after the date
counsel to the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement notifies in writing counsel to the
Debtors that the administrative agent intends for the Standstill Termination Date to occur and that it
may provide consent to the counterparties to set off any Credit Agreement obligations and (iii)
August 22, 2016.

Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Management’s
Discussion and Analysis in Part II—Item 7 of our 2015 Annual Report and the consolidated
financial statements and related notes therein.  Our 2015 Annual Report contains a discussion of
other matters not included herein, such as disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and
estimates and contractual obligations.  You should also read the following discussion and analysis
together with Part II—Item 1A “—Risk Factors” of this report, the “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Information” in this report and in our 2015 Annual Report and Part I—Item 1A “—
Risk Factors” of our 2015 Annual Report.
We are an independent oil and gas partnership and have been focused on the acquisition,
exploitation and development of oil, natural gas liquids (“NGL”) and natural gas properties in the
United States. Our objective is to manage our oil and natural gas producing properties for the
purpose of generating cash flows and making distributions to our unitholders. Our assets consist
primarily of producing and non-producing oil, NGL and natural gas reserves located in seven
producing areas:
•Midwest (Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky);
•Ark-La-Tex (Arkansas, Louisiana and East Texas);
•Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico;
•Mid-Continent (Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle);
•Rockies (Wyoming and Colorado);
•Southeast (Florida and Alabama); and
•California.
Chapter 11 Cases
On May 15, 2016, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the
caption In re Breitburn Energy Partners LP, et al, Case No. 16-11390. No trustee has been
appointed and we will continue to manage ourselves and our affiliates and operate our businesses
as “debtors in possession” subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To
assure ordinary course operations, we have received approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a
variety of “first day” motions, including motions that authorize us to maintain our existing cash
management system, to secure debtor-in-possession financing and other customary relief. In
connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the DIP Credit Agreement has been approved on an interim
basis.
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in the acceleration of the Debtors’
obligations under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of all obligations with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. Any efforts to enforce such obligations are
automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and the holders’ rights of
enforcement in respect of these obligations are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code. We are making adequate protection payments with respect to the Credit
Agreement consisting of the payment of interest (at the default rate) and the payment of all
reasonable fees and expenses provided for in the Credit Agreement. We are also making
adequate protection payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes in the form of the payment
of all reasonable fees and expenses of professionals retained by the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that resulted in
a termination right by counterparties on our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments.
Effect of Filing on Creditors and Unitholders
On April 14, 2016, we elected to suspend the declaration of any further distributions on our Series
A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units. In addition, we elected to defer $46.7 million in
interest payments due with respect to our Senior Unsecured Notes, with such interest payments
due on April 15, 2016 and subject to a 30-day grace period. As a consequence of the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, such interest payments have not been made.
Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise,
pre-petition liabilities and post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our
Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units are entitled to receive any
distribution or retain any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors
and/or unitholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or
plans of reorganization. No assurance can be given as to what distributions, if any, will be made to
each of these constituencies or the nature thereof. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code
are met, a plan of reorganization can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection or deemed
rejection by the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common
Units and notwithstanding the fact that such holders do not receive or retain any property on
account of
28
their equity interests under the plan. Because of such possibilities, the value of our securities,
including our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units, is highly
speculative. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the holders of our Series A Preferred
Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units will retain any value under a plan of
reorganization.
Process for Plan of Reorganization. In order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11, the Debtors
will need to obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies
the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization generally provides for the
treatment and satisfaction of pre-petition obligations and equity interests and provides for the
means by which the plan of reorganization will be implemented.
Acquisitions and Other Transactions
In January 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase CO2 assets in Harding County, New
Mexico for a total purchase price of $3.9 million. We acquired compression, dehydration, and
electrical sub-station facilities, all associated surface leases and contracts related to the facilities,
and six existing producing wells associated with the leases and gathering lines.
In March 2016, we completed the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent assets for net proceeds of
$11.8 million. The sale includes all Mid-Continent properties acquired in the merger with QRE in
2014, excluding five wells for which we have asset retirement obligations and over-riding royalty
interests and royalty interests in an additional 42 wells. This transaction was effective January 1,
2016. We recognized a gain of $12.3 million from the Mid-Continent Sale.
Distributions
        
Through March 31, 2016, we paid cumulative distributions in cash on the Series A Preferred Units
on a monthly basis at a monthly rate of $0.171875 per Series A Preferred Unit, totaling $4.1 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
Through March 31, 2016, we elected to pay our Series B Preferred Unit distributions in kind by
issuing additional Series B Preferred Units (or, when elected by the unitholder, by issuing
Common Units in lieu of such Series B Preferred Units) instead of cash. During the three months
ended March 31, 2016, we declared distributions on our Series B Preferred Units of 0.006666
Series B Preferred Unit per unit in the form of 818,626 Series B Preferred Units and 163,314
Common Units. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $11.1 million of
accrued distributions on the Series B Preferred Units, which are included in non-cash distributions
to Series B preferred unitholders on the consolidated statements of operations.
We accrued for earned but undeclared distributions on each series of Preferred Units for the period
from April 1, 2016 to the Chapter 11 Filing Date. As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, the accrued but
unpaid distributions of $6.4 million were reflected as liabilities subject to compromise.
Operational Focus and Capital Expenditures
In the first six months of 2016, our capital expenditures for oil and gas activities, including
capitalized engineering costs, totaled $32 million, compared to approximately $132 million in the
first six months of 2015.  We spent approximately $12 million in Ark-La-Tex, $8 million in the
Permian Basin, $7 million in Oklahoma, $4 million in California, and and $1 million in the Jay
Field.  In the first six months of 2016, we drilled and completed six productive wells in Ark-La-Tex
and one in the Permian Basin. We also performed three recompletions in California.
Our 2016 capital spending program for oil and gas activities, including capitalized engineering
costs and excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $80 million. This compares with
approximately $209 million in 2015. We anticipate that 64% of our total capital spending will be for
drilling and rate-generating projects and CO2 purchases that are designed to increase or add to
production or reserves. In 2016, we plan to drill 17 wells in Ark-La-Tex and the Permian Basin.
In the first half of 2016, we executed a workforce reduction plan as part of a company-wide
reorganization effort intended to reduce costs, due in part to lower commodity prices, and another
workforce reduction plan in connection with the notice received from PCEC on February 5, 2016 of
its intention to terminate the administrative services agreement with Breitburn Management,
effective as of June 30, 2016. The reductions were communicated to affected employees on
various dates during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and all such notifications were
completed by June 30, 2016. The plans resulted in a reduction of approximately 69 employees.

Commodity Prices
Our revenues and net income are sensitive to oil, NGL and natural gas prices, which have been
and are expected to continue to be highly volatile.
In the second quarter of 2016, the NYMEX WTI spot price averaged $45 per barrel, compared with
approximately $58 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015.  In the first six months of 2016, the
NYMEX WTI spot price ranged from a low of $26 per barrel to a high of $51 per barrel. In the first
six months of 2015, the NYMEX WTI spot price ranged from a low of $43 per barrel to a high of $61
per barrel.
In the second quarter of 2016, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price averaged $2.15 per MMBtu
compared with approximately $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2015.  In the first six
months of 2016, the Henry Hub natural gas spot price ranged from a low of $1.49 per MMBtu to a
high of $2.94 per MMBtu.  In the first six months of 2015, the Henry Hub spot price ranged from a
low of $2.50 per MMBtu to a high of $3.32 per MMBtu.  In the second quarter of 2016, the MichCon
natural gas spot price averaged $1.99 per MMBtu compared with approximately $2.78 per MMBtu
in the second quarter of 2015.
These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted revenues, earnings and cash flows, and
sustained low oil and natural gas prices will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position.
We expect that further or sustained crude oil and natural gas prices will not only decrease our
revenues, but will also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce
economically and therefore lower our crude oil and natural gas reserves.
The continued volatility and significant decline in oil and natural gas prices increase the
uncertainty as to the impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves. We are unable
to predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market.  Changing
commodity prices, whether lower or higher, can have a significant impact on the volumetric
quantities of our proved reserve portfolio.  The impact of commodity price changes on our
estimated proved reserves can be illustrated as follows: if the SEC-mandated 2015 beginning of
the prior 12 months average prices used for our December 31, 2015 reserve report had been
replaced with NYMEX WTI, ICE Brent and NYMEX Henry Hub Futures strip prices for the
applicable commodity as of June 30, 2016 (without assuming any change in development plans or
costs, which has historically not been the case in periods of prolonged depressed commodity
prices), then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated
proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 would have increased by approximately 31%. The
prices assumed in this example were derived using NYMEX WTI, ICE Brent and NYMEX Henry
Hub Futures strip prices at June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2022, which averaged $54.14 per
Bbl, $56.77 per Bbl, and $3.12 per Mcf, respectively, and then held flat thereafter. The average
realized blended price is $36.86 per Boe. We believe that the use of NYMEX WTI, ICE Brent and
NYMEX Henry Hub Futures strip prices may help provide investors with an understanding of the
impact of sustained lower commodity price conditions on our proved reserves through an assumed
period.  However, the use of this pricing example does not necessarily indicate management’s
overall view on future commodity prices. In addition, if downward revisions of proved reserves
occur in the future, we could have future impairments and/or further increases in our DD&A rates.
We are not able to predict the timing and amount of future reserve revisions, nor the impact such
revisions may have on our future DD&A rates.

Comparison of Results for the Three Months and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
The variances in our results were due to the following components:
Production
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, total production was 4,606 MBoe compared to 5,015
MBoe for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of 8%, primarily due to lower oil
production from our Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, California and Florida properties as a result of
natural field declines, our curtailed capital program and the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent
assets in March 2016.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, total production was 9,454 MBoe compared to 10,066
MBoe for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of 6%, primarily due to lower oil
production from our Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, California and Florida properties as a result of
natural field declines, our curtailed capital program and the sale of certain of our Mid-Continent
assets in March 2016.
Oil, NGL and natural gas sales
Total oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues decreased $62.4 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. Crude oil revenues decreased
$54.2 million due to lower sales volume at our Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, California and
Florida properties and lower average crude oil prices. NGL revenues decreased $1.1 million
primarily due to lower average NGL prices. Natural gas revenues decreased $7.1 million primarily
due to lower average natural gas prices.
 
Realized prices for crude oil, excluding the effect of derivative instruments, decreased $11.87 per
Boe, or 22%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended
June 30, 2015. Realized prices for NGLs, excluding the effect of derivative instruments, decreased
$3.13 per Boe, or 17% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Realized prices for natural gas, excluding the effect of derivative
instruments, decreased $0.70 per Mcf, or 27%, for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Total oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues decreased $119.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Crude oil revenues decreased
$99.7 million due to lower average crude oil prices and lower sales volume in Permian Basin, Mid-
Continent, California and Florida properties. NGL revenues decreased $3.3 million, primarily due
to lower average NGL prices. Natural gas revenues decreased $16.6 million primarily due to lower
average natural gas prices.
 
Realized prices for crude oil, excluding the effect of derivative instruments, decreased $13.39 per
Boe, or 28%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30,
2015. Realized prices for NGLs, excluding the effect of derivative instruments, decreased $4.41 per
Boe, or 25% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30,
2015. Realized prices for natural gas, excluding the effect of derivative instruments, decreased
$0.85 per Mcf, or 30%, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015.
(Loss) gain on commodity derivative instruments
Loss on commodity derivative instruments for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $92.2
million compared to a gain of $93.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Gain on
oil and natural gas derivative instrument settlements totaled $476.2 million for three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to a gain of $100.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015,
primarily due to the termination of our commodity derivative transactions in connection with the
filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions.
 
Mark-to-market loss on commodity derivative instruments for the three months ended June 30,
2016 was $568.4 million primarily due to the termination of our commodity derivative transactions
in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions, compared to a mark-to-market loss of
$194.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in
commodity prices and derivative instrument settlements during the three months ended June 30,
2015.
32
Loss on commodity derivative instruments for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $54.3
million compared to a gain of $43.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015. Gain on oil
and natural gas derivative instrument settlements totaled $611.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to a gain of $226.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015,
primarily due to the termination in 2016 of our commodity derivative transactions in connection with
the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions.
 
Mark-to-market loss on commodity derivative instruments for the six months ended June 30, 2016
was $665.8 million, primarily due to the termination in 2016 of our commodity derivative
transactions in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions, compared to a mark-to-market
loss of $183.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to derivative
instrument settlements during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
    
Other revenues, net
Other revenues decreased $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to $0.9 million lower salt water disposal revenue
and $0.8 million lower pipeline revenue.
Other revenues decreased $4.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to $1.8 million lower salt water disposal revenue
and $1.7 million lower pipeline revenue.
Lease operating expenses
Pre-tax lease operating expenses, including district expenses, transportation expenses and
processing fees, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $25.4 million compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in pre-tax lease operating expenses
primarily reflects cost-cutting efforts and lower oil production volumes leading to lower overall
costs. On a per Boe basis, pre-tax lease operating expenses excluding $0.6 million of non-cash
unit based compensation expense were 21% lower than the three months ended June 30, 2015 at
$14.74 per Boe, primarily due to lower commodity prices, cost-cutting efforts, and lower well
service expenses.
Production and property taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $10.5 million,
which was $4.8 million lower than the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower
crude oil and natural gas prices and lower oil production.  On a per Boe basis, production and
property taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $2.29 per Boe, which was 25%
lower than the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower commodity prices.
Pre-tax lease operating expenses, including district expenses, transportation expenses and
processing fees, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $45.6 million compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in pre-tax lease operating expenses primarily
reflects cost-cutting efforts, lower commodity prices and lower oil production volumes leading to
lower overall costs. On a per Boe basis, pre-tax lease operating expenses excluding $1.5 million of
non-cash unit based compensation expense were 19% lower than the six months ended June 30,
2015 at $15.53 per Boe, primarily due to lower commodity prices, cost-cutting efforts, and lower
well service expenses.
Production and property taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $20.5 million, which
was $8.4 million lower than the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower crude oil
and natural gas prices and lower oil production.  On a per Boe basis, production and property taxes
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $2.16 per Boe, which was 25% lower than the six
months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to lower commodity prices.
Change in inventory
In Florida, our crude oil sales are a function of the number and size of crude oil shipments in each
quarter, and thus crude oil sales do not always coincide with volumes produced in a given
quarter.  Sales occur on average every eight weeks.  We match production expenses with crude oil
sales.  Production expenses associated with unsold crude oil inventory are credited to operating
costs through the change in inventory account.  Production expenses are charged to operating
costs through the change in inventory account when they are sold.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the change in inventory account amounted to a charge
of less than $0.1 million compared to a charge of $2.2 million during the same period in 2015.  The
charge to inventory during the three months ended June 30, 2016 primarily reflects a slightly higher
volume of crude oil sold than produced during the quarter. The charge during the three months
ended June 30, 2015 reflects the higher volume of crude oil sold than produced during the quarter.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we sold 127 gross MBbls and produced 115 gross
MBbls of crude oil from our Florida operations.
33
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the change in inventory account amounted to a credit of
$0.3 million compared to a charge of $2.3 million during the same period in 2015.  The credit to
inventory during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily reflects a slightly lower volume of
crude oil sold than produced during the quarter. The charge during the six months ended June 30,
2015 reflects the higher volume of crude oil sold than produced during the period. In the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we sold 237 gross MBbls and produced 240 gross MBbls of crude oil from
our Florida operations.
Depletion, depreciation and amortization
DD&A totaled $82.0 million, or $17.79 per Boe, during the three months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of approximately 18% per Boe compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
DD&A totaled $165.7 million, or $17.53 per Boe, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of approximately 20% per Boe compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decreases in DD&A per Boe were primarily due to impairments of proved properties during the
year ended December 31, 2015 driven by decreases in commodity prices and the effect the
impairments had on our reserve volumes and DD&A rates.
Impairments
    
There were no impairments during the three months ended June 30, 2016 or June 30, 2015.
      
Impairments of proved properties totaled $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
including $2.1 million in the Southeast, $0.5 million in the Permian Basin, and $0.2 million in the
Rockies, primarily related to the impact of the drop in commodity strip prices in the first quarter of
2016 on projected future revenues of our lower margin properties. Impairments of proved properties
totaled $59.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, including $33.1 million in the
Permian Basin, $16.7 million in the Rockies and $9.3 million in Mid-Continent.
General and administrative expenses
Our general and administrative expenses (“G&A”) totaled $16.3 million and $22.9 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  G&A included $3.3 million and $6.1
million in non-cash unit-based compensation expense related to employee incentive plans for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  G&A, excluding non-cash unit-based
compensation, were $12.9 million and $16.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  Unit-based compensation for Phantom Units expected to be settled in cash
included in G&A totaled a a credit of $0.5 million and zero for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in G&A excluding non-cash unit-based compensation
was primarily due to $2.7 million of integration costs incurred during the three months ended
June 30, 2015, and lower office rent and accounting fees. On a per Boe basis, G&A expenses
excluding non-cash unit-based compensation were $2.81 and $3.35 for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding integration costs incurred during the three months
ended June 30, 2015, G&A per Boe would have been $2.80 for three months ended June 30,
2015.
Our G&A expenses totaled $37.7 million and $55.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  This included $7.1 million and $13.0 million in non-cash unit-based
compensation expense related to employee incentive plans for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  G&A, excluding non-cash unit-based compensation, were $30.5
million and $42.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Unit-
based compensation for Phantom Units expected to be settled in cash included in G&A totaled
$0.2 million and zero for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
decrease in G&A excluding non-cash unit-based compensation was primarily due to $7.4 million of
integration costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2015, lower employee related
expenses due to a decrease in the number of employees, and lower legal costs. On a per Boe
basis, G&A expenses excluding non-cash unit-based compensation were $3.23 and $4.18 for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding integration costs incurred
during the six months ended June 30, 2015, G&A per Boe would have been $3.45 for six months
ended June 30, 2015.
Restructuring costs
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we completed workforce reduction plans as
part of company-wide reorganization efforts intended to reduce costs, due in part to lower
commodity prices. In addition, we executed workforce reductions during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 in connection with the termination of PCEC’s administrative services agreement
with Breitburn Management, effective as of June 30, 2016.
34
The workforce reductions during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were communicated to
affected employees on various dates during the period, and all such notifications were completed
by June 30, 2016. The plans resulted in a reduction of 12 employees and 69 employees,
respectively, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016.
The 2015 reduction was communicated to affected employees on various dates during March
2015, and all such notifications were completed by March 31, 2015. The plan resulted in a
reduction of zero employees and 37 employees, respectively, for the three months and six months
ended June 30, 2015.
In connection with the reductions in workforce, we incurred total costs of approximately $2.4
million, $5.2 million, $1.8 million and $6.7 million during the three months and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which included severance cash payments, accelerated
vesting of LTIP grants for certain individuals and other employee-related termination costs.
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized
Our interest expense totaled $49.9 million and $61.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  The $11.5 million decrease in interest expense compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to $18.0 million lower interest expense on
our Senior Notes as no further interest expense was recognized on the Senior Notes subject to
compromise upon the Chapter 11 Filing Date, partially offset by $2.8 million higher amortization of
debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, primarily due to higher debt issuance costs write-
offs in 2016 due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements for a discussion of debt issuance cost write-offs in 2016 and 2015) and $3.7 million
higher credit facility interest due to a higher default interest rate resulting from the commencement
of the Chapter 11 Cases.
Our interest expense totaled $105.9 million and $101.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  The $4.8 million increase in interest expense compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015 was due to $9.1 million higher amortization of debt issuance costs,
premiums and discounts, primarily due to debt issuance cost write-offs in 2016, and $8.7 million
higher interest expense on our Senior Secured Notes due to the issuance of the notes on April 8,
2015, partially offset by $11.7 million lower interest expense on our Senior Unsecured Notes due
to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and $1.3 million lower credit facility interest expense due to
lower credit facility borrowings, partially offset by higher default interest rate from the filing of the
Chapter 11 Petitions.
Loss on interest rate swaps
We are subject to interest rate risk associated with loans under the Credit Agreement that bear
interest based on floating rates. In order to mitigate our interest rate exposure, as of March 31,
2016, we had interest rate swaps, indexed to 1-month LIBOR, to fix a portion of floating LIBOR-
based debt under our credit facility for 2016 and 2017, for notional amounts of $710 million and
$200 million, respectively, with average fixed rates of 1.28% and 1.23%, respectively. The
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on May 15, 2016 resulted in an event of default under
derivative instrument agreements, resulting in a termination right by our counterparties. As the
derivative contracts terminated as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, they are
no longer accounted for at fair value, and have been recognized as payables at termination value.
Gain on interest swaps for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.5 million, including a
$4.4 million loss on settlements (including terminated derivatives) and a $4.9 million mark-to-
market gain, primarily due to the termination of our interest rate derivative contracts in connection
with the bankruptcy filing. The loss on interest rate swaps for the three months ended June 30,
2015 was $0.6 million, including a $1.5 million loss on settlements and a $0.9 million mark-to-
market gain.
Loss on interest swaps for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.8 million, including a $5.9
million loss on settlements (including terminated derivatives) and a $4.1 million mark-to-market
gain, primarily due to the termination of our interest rate derivative contracts in connection with the
bankruptcy filing. The loss on interest rate swaps for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $2.4
million, including a $2.9 million loss on settlements and a $0.5 million mark-to-market gain.
Reorganization items, net
We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization in
connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. These costs are being expensed as incurred, and are
expected to significantly affect our results of operations. Reorganization items, net includes
expenses, gains and losses that are the result of the reorganization and restructuring of the
business. Professional fees included in reorganization items, net represent professional fees for
post-petition expenses. Deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts/premiums are related
to the Senior Notes, and are
35
included in reorganization items, net as we believe these debt instruments will be impacted by the
Chapter 11 Cases. Reorganization items, net totaled $66.9 million and $66.9 million for the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.  See Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements for further details.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We have historically funded our operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through
cash generated from operations, amounts available under the Credit Agreement and equity and
debt offerings. Future cash flow is subject to a number of variables, including oil and natural gas
prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014
and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have
negatively impacted revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas
prices will have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position.
Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
As a result of sustained losses and the Chapter 11 Cases, the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership, are subject to
uncertainty. Given uncertainty surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated interim financial
statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the Chapter 11 Cases. In
particular, the consolidated financial statements do not purport to show (i) as to assets, their
realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (ii) as to pre-petition
liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or the status and priority
thereof; (iii) as to unitholders’ equity accounts, the effect of any changes that may be made in our
capitalization; or (iv) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made to our business.
While operating as debtors in possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors
may sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities in amounts other than those
reflected in our consolidated interim financial statements, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business. Further, a plan of reorganization
could materially change the amounts and classifications in our historical consolidated interim
financial statements.
We are making adequate protection payments with respect to the Credit Agreement consisting of
the payment of interest (at the default rate) and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses
provided for in the Credit Agreement. We are also making adequate protection payments with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes in the form of the payment of all reasonable fees and
expenses of professionals retained by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The consolidated
financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a going concern basis of
accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial
statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties as
discussed above.
DIP Credit Agreement
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, BOLP entered into the DIP Credit Agreement as
borrower the DIP Lenders and Wells Fargo, National Association, as administrative agent. The
other Debtors have guaranteed all obligations under the DIP Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the
terms of the DIP Credit Agreement, the DIP Lenders have made available a revolving credit facility
in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million (and the DIP Lenders have offered to arrange an
additional $75 million of financing under the DIP Credit Agreement at the borrower’s request),
which includes a letter of credit facility available for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed a sub-limit of $50 million, and a swingline facility in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed a sub-limit of $5 million, in each case, to mature on the earlier to
occur of (A) the effective date of a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases or (B) the stated
maturity of the DIP Credit Agreement of January 15, 2017. In addition, the maturity date may be
accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement.
The proceeds of the DIP Credit Agreement may be used: (i) to pay the costs and expenses of
administering the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) to fund our working capital needs, capital improvements,
and other general corporate purposes, in each case, in accordance with an agreed budget and (iii)
to provide adequate protection to existing secured creditors.
36
Acceleration of Debt Obligations
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in the acceleration of the Debtors’
obligations under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of all obligations with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes. Any efforts to enforce such obligations are
automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and the holders’ rights of
enforcement in respect of these obligations are subject to the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.
Credit Agreement
As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date we had $1.197 billion in unpaid principal outstanding under the
Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in and lien on
substantially all of the Debtors’ assets, including the proceeds thereof and after-acquired property.
Based on third party reports of our estimated proved reserves of oil, NGLs and natural gas as of
December 31, 2015, we estimate that the Credit Agreement is fully collateralized. Therefore, upon
acceleration as a consequence of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, we reclassified the
Credit Agreement balance to current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets,
as the lenders can terminate all letters of credit and can call on unpaid principal loan balances and
interest to be immediately due and payable. As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, we recognized $15.7
million of interest expense for the full write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the
Credit Agreement.
We are required to make adequate protection payments to the lenders under the Credit Agreement,
which includes interest (at the default rate) as provided in the Credit Agreement. We are
recognizing the default interest accrued on the Credit Agreement as interest expense, net of
capitalized interest on the consolidated statements of operations, and we are recognizing the
adequate protection payments as accrued interest payable on the consolidated balance sheets,
rather than in liabilities subject to compromise.
    
At June 30, 2016, the default interest rate on the Credit Agreement was 6.75%.
Senior Secured Notes
As of March 31, 2016, we had $650 million of Senior Secured Notes, which had a carrying value of
$614.1 million, net of unamortized discount of $16.5 million and unamortized debt issuance costs
of $19.4 million. Interest on our Senior Secured Notes is payable quarterly in March, June,
September and December.
Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on May 15, 2016, no interest has been paid to
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As of June 30, 2016, the Senior Secured Notes were
reflected as liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet, with the carrying
value equal to the face value.
Senior Unsecured Notes
As of March 31, 2016, we had $305 million in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Senior Notes,
which had a carrying value of $298.2 million, net of unamortized discount of $2.8 million and
unamortized debt issuance costs of $4.0 million. In addition, as of March 31, 2016, we had $850
million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Senior Notes, which had a carrying value of $842.6
million, net of unamortized premium of $4.3 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of $11.7
million. Interest on the 2020 Senior Notes and the 2022 Senior Notes is payable twice a year in
April and October.
On April 14, 2016, we elected to defer a $33.5 million interest payment due with respect to our
2022 Senior Notes and a $13.2 million interest payment due with respect to our 2020 Senior
Notes, with each such interest payment due on April 15, 2016 and subject to a 30-day grace
period. As a consequence of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, such interest payments
have not been made.
Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on May 15, 2016, no interest has been paid to
the holders of the Senior Unsecured Notes. As of June 30, 2016, the Senior Secured Notes were
reflected as liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet, with the carrying
values equal to the face values.
37
Cash Flows
 
Operating activities.  Our cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended June 30,
2016 were $161.0 million compared to $214.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower sales revenues in 2016
driven by lower commodity prices, which reduced sales revenue by approximately $91 million, a
5% decrease in sales volume primarily due to lower Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, California and
Florida oil production, which reduced sales revenue by approximately $29 million, and $52 million
lower commodity derivative settlement receipts primarily due to the termination of our derivative
transactions in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions and $4 million lower other
revenue, partially offset by approximately $55 million lower operating costs primarily at our Ark-La-
Tex, Mid-Continent, Permian Basin, and Southeast properties. Cash flow from working capital
changes during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $62.6 million higher than the six months
ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to higher interest payable (which has been reclassified to
liabilities subject to compromise) due to deferral of April 2016 interest payments on the Senior
Unsecured Notes, and due to delay in payment of certain accounts payable (which have been
reclassified to liabilities subject to compromise) due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions.
Investing activities.  Net cash flows used in investing activities during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $41.0 million and $189.3 million, respectively. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we spent $46.3 million on capital expenditures, consisting of approximately
$41.5 million primarily for drilling and completion activities, and approximately $4.8 million for IT
and other capital expenditures, $6.9 million on purchases of available-for-sale securities, and $6.0
million on property acquisitions, primarily for CO2 producing properties and additional leases in
Ark-La-Tex, partially offset by $11.8 million in net proceeds from sale of assets and $6.3 million in
proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities. During the six months ended June 30, 2015,
we spent $170.6 million on capital expenditures, primarily for drilling and completion activities,
$17.7 million on property acquisitions, primarily for CO2 producing properties, $3.6 million on
purchases of available-for-sale securities and $0.9 million on CO2 advances, partially offset by
$3.5 million in proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities.
Financing activities.  Net cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 were $40.0 million and $28.7 million, respectively. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, we decreased our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility by approximately
$31.7 million. At June 30, 2016, we had total outstanding borrowings of approximately $3.01
billion.  At December 31, 2015, we had total outstanding borrowings, net of unamortized
discount/premium and unamortized debt issuance cost on our Senior Notes, of approximately
$2.98 billion.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we made cash distributions of $5.5
million on Series A Preferred Units, borrowed $37.3 million and repaid $69.0 million under our
credit facility, and paid $2.7 million for DIP financing costs.  During the six months ended June 30,
2015, we received net proceeds of $337.9 million from issuance of Series B Preferred Units and
$4.9 million from issuance of Common Units, made cash distributions of $8.3 million on Series A
Preferred Units, cash distributions of $81.2 million on Common Units, borrowed $1.0 billion and
repaid $1.3 billion under our credit facility, and paid $29.2 million in debt issuance costs. 
 
Preferred Units
On May 21, 2014, we sold 8.0 million Series A Preferred Units in a public offering at a price of
$25.00 per Series A Preferred Unit, resulting in proceeds of $193.2 million net of underwriting
discount and offering expenses of $6.8 million. The Series A Preferred Units rank senior to our
Common Units and on parity with the Series B Preferred Units with respect to the payment of
distributions. Through March 31, 2016, we paid cumulative distributions in cash on the Series A
Preferred Units on a monthly basis at a monthly rate of $0.171875 per Series A Preferred Unit,
totaling $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
On April 8, 2015, we issued in a private offering $350 million of Series B Preferred Units at an
issue price of $7.50 per unit. We received approximately $337.2 million from this offering, net of
fees and estimated expenses, which we primarily used to repay borrowings under our credit
facility. The Series B Preferred Units rank senior to our Common Units and on parity with the
Series A Preferred Units with respect to the payment of distributions.
On April 14, 2016, we elected to suspend the declaration of any further distributions on our Series
A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units. As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, we had 8.0
million Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding and 49.6 million Series B Preferred Units
issued and outstanding. As of the Chapter 11 Filing Date, distributions are no longer being accrued
on the Series A Preferred Units and Series B Preferred Units.
38
Through the three months ended March 31, 2016, we elected to pay our Series B Preferred Unit
distributions in kind by issuing additional Series B Preferred Units (or, when elected by the
unitholder, by issuing Common Units in lieu of such Series B Preferred Units) instead of cash.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we declared distributions on our Series B
Preferred Units at a monthly rate of 0.006666 Series B Preferred Units per unit, in the form of a total
of 818,626 Series B Preferred Units and 163,314 Common Units. During each of the three months
and six months ended June 30, 2015, we declared distributions on our Series B Preferred Units at
a monthly rate of 0.006666 Series B Preferred Units per unit, in the form of a total of 575,291 Series
B Preferred Units and 121,584 Common Units.
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we recognized
$3.7 million and $11.1 million, $6.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of accrued distributions
on the Series B Preferred Units, which were included in non-cash distributions to Series B
preferred unitholders on the consolidated statements of operations. During each of the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we recognized $2.0 million, $6.1
million, $4.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively, of accrued distributions on the Series A
Preferred Units, which were included in distributions to Series A preferred unitholders on the
consolidated statements of operations.
    
Common Units
    
In response to current commodity and financial market conditions, the Board suspended
distributions on Common Units and RPUs effective with the third monthly payment attributable to
the third quarter of 2015.
Credit Agreement
At each of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a $5.0 billion credit facility with a
maturity date of November 19, 2019. At each of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our
borrowing base was $1.8 billion.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion at each date in indebtedness
outstanding under our credit facility. As a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, all
obligations under the Credit Agreement were accelerated.
As of June 30, 2016, the lending group under the Credit Agreement included 35 banks.  Of the $1.4
billion in total commitments under our credit facility, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association held
approximately 5% of the commitments, with the remaining 34 banks holding between 1% and 4.2%
of the commitments.
See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Overview” for a discussion of the bankruptcy filing as it
relates to our Credit Agreement.
 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The filing of the Chapter 11 Petitions triggered an event of default under each of our ISDA
Agreements. As a result, our counterparties were permitted to terminate, and did terminate, all
outstanding transactions governed by the ISDA Agreements. The termination date for each
outstanding transaction is the termination date specified to us by our counterparties.
All of our derivative counterparties are also lenders, or affiliates of lenders, under our Credit
Agreement (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). In accordance with the DIP
Interim Order, our counterparties were permitted to terminate any outstanding derivative
transactions and to calculate the amounts due to or from the Debtors as a result of such
terminations, in accordance with the terms of the governing agreements. However, each such
counterparty is required to hold any proceeds due to the Debtors in a book entry account
maintained by the counterparty until the Standstill Termination Date. The Credit Agreement is fully
collateralized, and excluded from liabilities subject to compromise. Therefore, settlements
payables due to our counterparties are reflected in accounts payable on the consolidated balance
sheets rather than in liabilities subject to compromise.
At June 30, 2016, we had $458.8 million of estimated commodity derivative instrument settlements
receivable and $3.9 million of estimated interest rate derivative instrument settlements payable.
As of June 30, 2016, our derivative counterparties were Bank of Montreal, Barclays Bank PLC,
BNP Paribas, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Citibank, N.A, Comerica Bank, Credit Suisse
Energy LLC, Credit Suisse International, ING
39
Capital Markets LLC, Fifth Third Bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., Merrill Lynch Commodities,
Inc., Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., PBN Bank, N.A, Royal Bank of Canada, The Bank of
Nova Scotia, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Union Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. On all
transactions where we are exposed to counterparty risks, we analyze the counterparty’s financial
condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish limits and monitor the appropriateness of
these limits on an ongoing basis. We periodically obtain credit default swap information on our
counterparties.  As of June 30, 2016, each of these financial institutions had an investment grade
credit rating.  Although we currently do not believe we have a specific counterparty risk with any
party, our loss could be substantial if any of these parties were to default. As of June 30, 2016, our
largest derivative settlements receivable were with Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Energy LLC,
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley, which accounted for approximately 15%, 12%, 11%
and 10% of our derivative settlements receivable, respectively.
Except as discussed above, we had no material changes to our financial contractual obligations
during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
New Accounting Standards
See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within this report for a discussion of new
accounting standards applicable to us.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The following should be read in conjunction with “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk” included under Part II—Item 7A in our 2015 Annual Report.  Also, see Note 4 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements within this report for additional discussion related to
our financial instruments. In the past, we have entered into derivative instruments to manage our
exposure to commodity price and interest rate volatility, and to assist with stabilizing cash flows. As
a result of certain events of default under our derivative contracts, all of our derivative contracts
have been terminated. For further discussion of the impact derivative instruments have had on our
cash flows, see “Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations”.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our General Partner’s principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our General
Partner’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Based upon the evaluation, our General Partner’s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of June 30, 2016 at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
40
PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
Although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our
operations in the normal course of business, we are not currently a party to any material legal
proceedings.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Part I—Item 1A “—Risk
Factors” of our 2015 Annual Report and in Part II—Item 1A “—Risk Factors” of our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016, except as follows.
We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.
During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to develop and
execute our business plan, and our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and
uncertainties associated with cases pending under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. These
risks include the following:
•our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization;
•the high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;
•
•
•
our ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions filed in Chapter 11 Cases from time to
time;
our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from Chapter 11 and execute our
business plan post-emergence;
our ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, customers, other third parties and our
employees;
•our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;
•our ability to execute our business plan in the current depressed commodity price environment;
•our ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;
the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other
agreements with us;
the ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to
cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; and
the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter
11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.
•
•
•
Delays in the Chapter 11 Cases increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business
and emerge from Chapter 11 and increase our costs associated with the Chapter 11 process.
These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For
example, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our
relationships with our suppliers, customers, other third parties and our employees, which in turn
could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we need the prior approval of
the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our
ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Because of the
risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot accurately predict or
quantify the ultimate impact of events that occur during our Chapter 11 Cases that may be
inconsistent with our plans.
Operating under Bankruptcy Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business.
Our future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of
reorganization. A long period of operations in Chapter 11 could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11
Cases continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and
effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A
prolonged period of operating in Chapter 11 also may make it more difficult to retain management
and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the
longer the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers will
lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish
alternative commercial relationships.
41
In addition, so long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, we will be required to incur substantial
costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter
11 Cases.
Furthermore, we cannot predict how claims and equity interests will be treated under a plan of
reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is confirmed and implemented, our operating
results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other
counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from chapter 11.
We may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan.
In order to emerge successfully from Chapter 11 as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory
disclosure requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a plan of
reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a reorganization plan and fulfill
other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a reorganization plan, which have not occurred to
date. There is no assurance that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed and become effective.
If the plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we
would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims and equity
interests against us would ultimately receive with respect thereto.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our
stated goals and continue as a going concern.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may continue to face a number of
risks, such as further deterioration in commodity prices or other changes in economic conditions,
changes in our industry, changes in demand for our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Some of
these risks become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted
period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and
others, we cannot guarantee that any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will achieve our stated
goals.
In addition, at the outset of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Bankruptcy Code gives the Debtors the
exclusive right to propose the plan of reorganization and prohibits creditors, equity security holders
and others from proposing a plan. We have currently retained the exclusive right to propose a plan
of reorganization. If that right is terminated, however, or the exclusivity period expires, there could
be a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization in
order to achieve our stated goals.
Furthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through a plan of reorganization, we may
need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various
means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our access to additional
financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available
when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, if they are available at all.
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital.
As a result, we cannot give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern, even if a
plan of reorganization is confirmed.
Any plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions
and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our plan
may be unsuccessful in its execution.
Any plan of reorganization that we may implement could affect both our capital structure and the
ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses
based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future
developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances.
Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and
assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to change
substantially our capital structure; (ii) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources;
(iii) our ability to maintain customers’ confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract
and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) our ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall
strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and oil and gas industries,
both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely
affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.
42
In addition, any plan of reorganization will be premised upon financial projections, including with
respect to revenues, EBITDAX, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial
projections are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and
estimates that are the basis of these financial projections will not be accurate. In our case, the
projections will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental
changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial
condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated.
Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any
plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the
anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any
such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the
successful execution of any plan of reorganization.
We believe it is highly likely that our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and
Common Units will be canceled in our Chapter 11 Cases.
We have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing Series A Preferred
Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units in our capital structure. As a result, we believe
that it is highly likely that the existing Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and
Common Units will be canceled in our Chapter 11 Cases with no recovery or distribution.
Accordingly, any trading in our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common
Units during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial
risks to purchasers of our Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units and Common Units.
We may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a
debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that
arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or
treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the
Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged
through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and
may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-
reorganization basis.
Our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.
During our Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as potential
asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations
and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial
statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial
performance after the date of our Chapter 11 filing.
In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated
financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements,
including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We
also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be
recorded at their fair values as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the
recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results
after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.
We have significant exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices since none of our estimated
future production is covered by commodity derivatives and we may not be able to enter into
commodity derivatives covering our estimated future production on favorable terms or at all.
We may not be able to enter into additional commodity derivatives covering our production in future
periods on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot or choose not to enter into commodity derivatives
in the future, we could be more affected by changes in commodity prices than our competitors who
engage in hedging arrangements. Our inability to hedge the risk of low commodity prices in the
future, on favorable terms or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
43
We anticipate engaging in transactions to reduce the Partnership’s indebtedness and manage our
liquidity that generate taxable income (including cancellation of indebtedness income) allocable to
unitholders, and income tax liabilities arising therefrom may exceed the value of your investment in
the Partnership.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, we anticipate engaging in transactions to de-lever the
Partnership and manage our liquidity that would result in income and gain to our unitholders
without a corresponding cash distribution. For example, we may sell assets and use the proceeds
to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, in which case, you would be allocated taxable
income and gain resulting from the sale without receiving a cash distribution or may exceed the
amount of any distribution we might pay in any given year. Further, during the course of the
Chapter 11 Cases, we will be seeking to restructure and, thereby, reduce our existing debt which,
depending on the form of the restructuring, could result in “cancellation of indebtedness income”
(also referred to as “COD income”) being allocated to our unitholders as ordinary taxable income.
Unitholders may be allocated COD income, and income tax liabilities arising therefrom may
exceed the current value of your investment in the Partnership.
Entities taxed as corporations may have net operating losses to offset COD income or may
otherwise qualify for an exception to the recognition of COD income, such as the bankruptcy or
insolvency exceptions. In the case of partnerships like ours, however, these exceptions are not
available to the Partnership and are only available to a unitholder if the unitholder itself is insolvent
or in bankruptcy. As a result, these exceptions generally would not apply to prevent the taxation of
COD income allocated to our unitholders. The ultimate tax effect of any such income allocations
will depend on the unitholder’s individual tax position, including, for example, the availability of any
suspended passive losses that may offset some portion of the allocable COD income. The
suspended passive losses available to offset COD income will increase the longer a unitholder
has owned our units. Unitholders may, however, be allocated substantial amounts of ordinary
income subject to taxation, without any ability to offset such allocated income against any capital
losses attributable to the unitholder’s ultimate disposition of its units.
It may be possible for unitholders to estimate their approximate allocation of COD income once the
amount of COD income that the Partnership will likely recognize, if any, is known. For example, if,
in a “worst-case scenario,” all of the Partnership’s liabilities are cancelled for no consideration
causing the recognition of approximately $3.0 billion in COD income, then based on 213,789,296
Common Units outstanding as of August 5, 2016, and assuming that no amount of COD income is
allocated to the Series A Units, each outstanding Common Unit would be allocated approximately
$14.03 of COD income.
Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences to them
of COD income.
