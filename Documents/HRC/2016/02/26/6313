<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>

the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the relevant human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> all the previous resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the last of 
which was resolution 2005/83 of 21 April 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the commitment and efforts undertaken by the African Union to support 
Somali-led efforts towards reconciliation and stability and the efforts made by international and 
regional stakeholders to help Somalia re-establish stability, peace and security in its national 
territory, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming also</i> the Declaration on the situation in Somalia, adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government of the African Union during the tenth ordinary session of the Assembly of the 
African Union, held in Addis Ababa from 31 January to 2 February 2008, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that humanitarian, human rights and development assistance is of paramount 
importance to alleviate poverty and to promote a more peaceful, equitable and democratic 
society in Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the steps taken within Somalia, including the convening of the National 
Reconciliation Congress, in July and August 2007, the recent appointment of a new 
Prime Minister, Nur Hassan Hussein, and the subsequent formation of a new Government, 
as well as the efforts made by the African Union, notably through the deployment of the 
African Union Mission in Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that, despite the daunting challenges confronting the peace and reconciliation 
process, the opportunity that arose in December 2006, when the Transitional Federal 
Government regained control of Mogadishu and other parts of the country in order to find a 
lasting solution to the crisis in Somalia, still exists,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need for both the Somali stakeholders and the international community as a 
whole to seize this opportunity to address decisively the conflict in Somalia and to take all steps 
required to this end, 
</p>
<p><i> Seriously concerned</i> about the human rights and humanitarian situation in Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern</i> that the security situation remains fragile throughout the country, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that efforts to combat terrorism in Somalia must respect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, which are inseparable from the establishment of peace in Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>

United Nations Human Rights Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures

the Transitional Federal Government and its security and defence forces; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Appeals</i> to the partners of the African Union to provide increased logistical and

community at large;
