<p><b>Addendum 
</b></p>
<p>1.  Subsequent to the submission of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights in the 
occupied Syrian Golan (A/HRC/10/15), the following reply was received from Algeria.  
</p><p> 
2.  In its note verbale, the Permanent Mission of Algeria informed the United Nations Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that Algeria considers that all measures and 
decisions of a legislative and administrative character that have been or will be taken by the 
Israeli occupying Power to modify the character and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan 
are null and void. Algeria further emphasized that such measures constitute a flagrant breach of 
international law and of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and are devoid of any legal consequence. Algeria stressed that 
in no way does it recognize such measures.
