STRATEGIC AMERICAN OIL CORPORATION
(An Exploration Stage Company)
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2009 (Unaudited)
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
NOTE 1: 
Strategic  American  Oil  Corporation  (the  "Company")  was  incorporated  as  Carlin  Gold  Corporation  on  April  12,  2005  in 
Nevada, U.S.A.  On July 11, 2005 the Company changed its name to Nevada Gold Corp., on October 18, 2005 the Company 
changed  its  name  to  Gulf  States  Energy  Inc.,  and  on  September  5,  2006  the  Company  changed  its  name  to  Strategic 
American Oil Corporation.  The Company is an exploration stage company as it has not generated significant revenues from 
operations.  The Company was formed for the purpose of oil and gas exploration and development.  The Company owns 
100% of Penasco Petroleum Inc. ("Penasco"), a Nevada corporation incorporated on November 23, 2005. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern which contemplates 
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  As at April 30, 2009, the Company 
had  a  working  capital  deficiency  of  $649,751  and  has  incurred  significant  losses  since  inception  and  further  losses  are 
anticipated  in  the  development  of  its  oil  and  gas  property  interests.    The  ability  of  the  Company  to  continue  as  a  going 
concern is dependent on raising additional capital to fund ongoing exploration and development and ultimately on generating 
future profitable operations.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might 
result  from  the  outcome  of  this  uncertainty.    Since  internally  generated  cash  flow  will  not  fund  development  and 
commercialization  of  the  Company's  oil  and  gas  properties,  the  Company  will  require  significant  additional  financial 
resources  and  will  be  dependent  on  future  financings  to  fund  its  ongoing  exploration  and  development  as  well  as  other 
working capital requirements.  The Company's future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate and 
extent of progress in its exploration and development programs.  There can be no assurance the Company will be successful 
in  its  efforts  to  raise  additional  financing  or  if  financing  is  available,  that  it  will  be  on  terms  that  are  acceptable  to  the 
Company. 
Management  is  addressing  going  concern  remediation  through  raising  additional  sources  of  capital  for  operations  and 
planned property acquisitions.  Management's plans are intended to increase the Company's financial stability and improve 
the  efficiency  of  continuing  operations.    The  Company  continues  to  raise  capital  through  private  placements  to  meet 
immediate  working  capital  requirements.    Management  expects  to  be  able  to  complete  planned  property  acquisitions  and 
funding  of  on-going  operations.    These  measures,  if  successful,  will  contribute  to  reducing  the  risk  of  going  concern 
uncertainties for the Company over the next twelve to twenty-four months. 
Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 
The  accompanying  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally 
accepted  accounting  principles  for  interim  financial  information.    They  may  not  include  all  information  and  footnotes 
required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  However, except as 
disclosed herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended July 31, 2008 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities 
and  Exchange  Commission.    The  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with 
those  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  the  Form  10-K.    In  the  opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments 
considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made.  Operating 
results for the nine months ended April 30, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year 
ending July 31, 2009.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NOTE 2: 
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with 
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America.    The  accompanying  consolidated  financial 
statements  include  the  accounts  of  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Penasco.    All  significant  inter-company  transactions  and 
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
3078683.2

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
NOTE 2: 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported.  By their nature, these estimates are subject to 
measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be 
significant.    Significant  areas  requiring  management’s  estimates  and  assumptions  are  determining  the  fair  value  of 
transactions involving common stock, and valuation and impairment losses on oil and gas property acquisitions.  Other areas 
requiring estimates include deferred tax balances, depreciation and depletion, and valuation of stock based compensation.  
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency of the Company, including its subsidiary, is United States dollars.  In accordance with SFAS No. 52, 
"Foreign Currency Translation", foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into their United States 
dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated at the transaction date.  Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year.  Net 
gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange translations and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on transactions 
occurring in a currency other than the Company's functional currency are included in the determination of net income in the 
period. 
Financial Instruments 
The fair values of cash, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and convertible 
notes  were  estimated  to  approximate  their  carrying  values  due to  the  immediate  or  short-term  maturity  of  these  financial 
instruments.  The Company’s operations and financing activities are conducted primarily in United States dollars, and as a 
result  the  Company  is  not  subject  to  significant  exposure  to  market  risks  from  changes  in  foreign  currency  rates.  
Management has determined that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk. 
Accounts Receivable 
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear any interest.  The Company regularly reviews 
collectability and establishes or adjusts an allowance for uncollectible amounts as necessary using the specific identification 
method.  Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the 
potential for recovery is considered remote.  There were no reserves for uncollectible amounts in the periods presented. 
Equipment 
Equipment acquisitions are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives at 
the following rates: 
 
 
 
 
Oil and Gas Properties 
The  Company  follows  the  full  cost  method  of  accounting  for  its  oil  and  gas  operations  whereby  all  cost  related  to  the 
acquisition of petroleum and natural gas interests are capitalized.  Such costs include land and lease acquisition costs, annual 
carrying charges of non-producing properties, geological and geophysical costs, costs of drilling and equipping productive 
and non-productive wells, and direct exploration salaries and related benefits.  The Company operates in one cost center, 
being the United States. 
All costs included in properties subject to amortization, are amortized on the unit-of-production method using estimates of 
proved  reserves.    Investments  in  unproved  properties  and  development  projects  are  not  amortized  until  proved  reserves 
associated  with  the  projects  can  be  determined  or  impairment  occurs.    If  the  results  of  an  assessment  indicate  that  the 
properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized.  Abandonment of oil 
and natural gas properties are charged to the full cost pool and amortized. 
Under the full cost method, the net book value of oil and natural gas properties are subject to a "ceiling" amount.  The ceiling 
is the estimated after-tax future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% per annum plus 
the lower of cost or fair market value of unevaluated properties.  In calculating future net revenues, prices and costs in effect 
at the time of the calculation are held constant for the lives of the oil and natural gas reserves, except for changes that are 
fixed  and  determinable  by  existing  contracts.    The  excess,  if  any,  of  the  net  book  value  above  this  ceiling  is  charged  to 
expense.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
NOTE 2: 
Sales  of  proved  and  unproved  properties  are  accounted  for  as  adjustments  of  capitalized  costs  with  no  gain  or  loss 
recognized, unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
The  Company  has  adopted  the  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  143  "Accounting  for  Asset  Retirement  Obligations,"  which 
establishes  standards  for  the  initial  measurement  and  subsequent  accounting  for  obligations  associated  with  the  sale, 
abandonment or other disposal of long-lived tangible assets arising from the acquisition, construction or development and for 
normal operations of such assets. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of 
an asset may  not be recoverable.  Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant 
decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation 
of  costs  significantly  in  excess  of  the  amount  originally  expected  for  the  acquisition  or  construction  of  the  asset;  current 
period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the 
use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the 
end of its estimated useful life.  Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future 
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is 
not recoverable and exceeds fair value. 
Revenue Recognition 
Oil  and  natural  gas  revenues  are  recorded  using  the  sales  method  whereby  the  Company  recognizes  oil  and  natural  gas 
revenue based on the amount of oil and gas sold to purchasers when title passes, the amount is determinable and collection is 
reasonably assured.  Actual sales of gas are based on sales, net of the associated volume charges for processing fees and for 
costs  associated  with  delivery,  transportation,  marketing,  and  royalties  in  accordance  with  industry  standards.    Operating 
costs and taxes are recognized in the same period of which revenue is earned. 
Income Taxes 
The  Company  follows  the  liability  method  of  accounting  for  income  taxes.    Under  this  method,  deferred  tax  assets  and 
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using  enacted  or  substantially  enacted  tax  rates  expected  to  apply  to  the  taxable  income  in  the  years  in  which  those 
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is 
recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.  As at April 30, 2009 the 
Company had net operating loss carry forwards; however, due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has provided a 
full valuation allowance for the potential deferred tax assets resulting from these losses carry forwards. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R "Share Based Payments", using the fair 
value  method.    All  transactions  in  which  goods  or  services  are  the  consideration  received  for  the  issuance  of  equity 
instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument 
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.  Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received 
as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. 
Loss per Common Share 
Basic  loss  per  share  includes  no  dilution  and  is  computed  by  dividing  loss  attributable  to  common  stockholders  by  the 
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential 
dilution of securities that could share in the earnings (loss) of the Company.  The common shares potentially issuable on 
conversion  of  outstanding  convertible  debentures  and  exercise  of  stock  options  were  not  included  in  the  calculation  of 
weighted average number of shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
RECLAMATION BONDS
NOTE 3: 
Reclamation bonds includes interest and non-interest bearing deposits issued in the States of Louisiana $38,130 (July 31, 
2008 - $41,192) and Texas $40,000 (July 31, 2008 - $40,000) to cover each State's reclamation requirement for producing 
operations.  During the nine months ended April 30, 2009 the Company recovered $3,062 from amounts on deposit in the 
State of Illinois.

OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
NOTE 5: 
Proved Properties 
Barge Canal, Texas 
On November 16, 2006 the Company completed an assignment and purchase agreement with OPEX Energy, LLC with an 
effective  date  of  August  1,  2006.    Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  Company  paid  $500,000  plus  a  finder's  fee  of 
$50,000  for  a  100%  working  interest  (90%  after  payout)  and  a  72.5%  net  revenue  interest  (65.25%  after  payout)  in 
approximately 81 acres of an oil and gas lease (the "Welder Lease") located in Calhoun County, Texas.  At the time of the 
acquisition, the two wells on the Welder lease were producing assets. 
South Delhi / Big Creek Field, Louisiana 
On  August  24,  2006,  the  Company  entered  into  an  assignment  of  oil  and  gas  interests  purchase  agreement  with  Energy 
Program  Accompany,  LLC  (the  "EPA  Purchase  Agreement").    Under  the  terms  of  the  EPA  Purchase  Agreement,  the 
Company paid $250,000 to acquire the Holt Lease, the Strahan Lease and the McKay Lease, as described below.  At the time 
of the acquisition, one of four wells on the Holt lease, one well on the Strahan lease, and no wells on the McKay lease were 
producing assets.  In December 2007 an independent registered engineer completed a reserve and economics report on the 
combined South Delhi and Big Creek Field properties.  The report outlined the proved developed producing reserves as of 
January  1,  2008  and  accordingly,  acquisition  costs  of  $290,290  and  development  costs  of  $42,900  were  reclassified  as 
capitalized proved oil and gas properties. 
The Holt Lease 
Pursuant to the EPA Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired a 97% working interest and an 81.25% net revenue interest 
in approximately 136 acres in Franklin Parish, Louisiana (the "Holt Lease"). 
The Strahan Lease 
Pursuant  to  the  EPA  Purchase  Agreement,  the  Company  acquired  a  100%  working  interest  and  an  81.25%  net  revenue 
interest in approximately 40 acres in Richland Parish, Louisiana (the "Strahan Lease"). 
The McKay Lease 
Pursuant  to  the  EPA  Purchase  Agreement,  the  Company  acquired  a  100%  working  interest  and  an  82.08%  net  revenue 
interest in approximately 80 acres in Richland Parish, Louisiana (the "McKay Lease"). On November 1, 2008 the Company 
assigned 100% of its interest in and to the McKay No. 1 well bore and leasehold.  Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, the 
Company  retained  ownership  to  all  surface  equipment,  which  was  subsequently  moved  to  the  Company’s  Holt  Lease  in 
Franklin Parish.  Additionally, all plugging liabilities were transferred to the purchaser and the Company retained no ORRI or 
working interest in the McKay No. 1 well. 
Assignment of Interests to Tradestar Resources Corporation 
In conjunction with the acquisition of the Holt Lease, the Strahan Lease and the McKay Lease, the Company assigned a 25% 
working  interest  with  respect  to  each  lease  to  Tradestar  Resources  Corporation  as  a  finder's  fee.    In  each  case,  the  25% 
working interest consists of two parts - a 12.5% working interest prior to payout and a 12.5% back in after payout agreement 
working interest.  Tradestar Energy Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tradestar Resources Corporation, became the operator 
of record for the Holt, Strahan and McKay Leases as of December 1, 2007.

OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES (CONTINUED)
NOTE 5: 
Little Mule Creek Project, Oklahoma 
In October 2007 the Company entered into an agreement with Marmik Oil Company ("Marmik") of Eldorado, Arkansas to 
purchase a 4.0% working interest in the Little Mule Creek Project located in Alfalfa and Woods Counties, Oklahoma.  Under 
the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the  Company's  interest  is  subject  to  a  25%  back  in  after  payout,  which  would  reduce  the 
Company's interest to 3.0%.  The prospect consists of nearly 11,550 acres.  To April 30, 2009 the Company has paid for a 
prorate share of land and geology-geophysical costs, charges to exercise additional lease options (prorata share), and a prorata 
share of drilling costs.  The initial well (RRCC#1-19), was drilled and tested and deemed to be uneconomical for commercial 
oil  and  gas  production,  and  was  plugged  in  second  quarter  2009.    Accordingly,  acquisition  and  development  costs  of 
$163,773 were deemed to be impaired during the period and added to the full cost pool, which is amortized on a unit-of-
production basis. 
Unproven Reserves 
Gobbler's Knob Prospect, Illinois 
Through December 15, 2008 the Company had entered into several oil and gas leases in Hamilton County, Illinois.  The 
leases  total  approximately  214  gross  acres  pursuant  to  which  the  Company  has  a  100%  working  interest  and  87.5%  net 
revenue  interest.    On  December  15,  2008  the  Company  assigned  all  214  gross  acres  of  the  Gobbler’s  Knob  prospect.  
Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, the Company retained a 7.5% ORRI and 10% back in after payout on any reworked 
drilled wells, and the purchaser must re-work or drill one well each 12 months to hold the acreage.  Accordingly, acquisition 
costs of $3,700 were written off to impairment during the period. 
Janssen Lease, Texas 
In October 2005 the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a 25% working interest and an 18.75% net revenue 
interest in approximately 138 acres of an oil and gas lease (the "Janssen Lease") located in Karnes County, Texas.  This lease 
interest was acquired from Rockwell Energy of Texas LLC for $220,000 plus additional payments of $13,800 to negotiate 
new oil, gas and mineral leases.  On December 20, 2006 the Company farmed out 100% of the working interest to ETG 
Energy Resources, retaining a 3% back in after payout on any producing zones and a 5% non-promoted option to participate 
in any offset drilling within the leased area.  At July 31, 2007 management determined the recoverable value of its interest to 
be $75,000 and accordingly, costs of $158,800 were written off to impairment in the 2007 fiscal year. 
Koliba Prospect, Texas 
Through April 30, 2009 the Company has entered into to several lease agreements with certain mineral owners of a 79 acre 
tract, and purchased an assignment of leases on an adjoining 64 acre tract (the "Koliba Lease") in Victoria County, Texas.  
The  Company  has  leased  over  95%  of  the  minerals  with  additional  leases  pending.    The  property  underlying  these  lease 
agreements  is  located  near  the  Barge  Canal  project  and  has  one  shut-in  oil/gas  well,  which  is  in  close  proximity  to  the 
Company’s Barge Canal gas sales line and salt water disposal system. 
Oakdale NE, Donoho, Markum City and DST Prospects, Illinois 
Through April 30, 2009 the Company has entered into numerous oil and gas leases in Jefferson County, Illinois.  The leases 
total approximately 2,560 gross acres pursuant to which the Company has a 100% working interest and a 87.5% net revenue 
interest.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES
NOTE 6: 
On March 25, 2009, the Company completed a convertible debenture financing of $150,000 issuing convertible promissory 
notes that bear interest at 15% per annum.  If not converted, the notes would be due on September 25, 2009.  The unpaid 
amount of principal and accrued interest can be converted at any time at the holder's option into shares of the Company’s 
common stock at a price of the greater of $0.25 or the current market price less 10%.  Additionally, the Company issued to 
the  Lender,  as  fully  paid  and  non-assessable,  600,000  non-transferable  and  registerable  share  purchase  warrants  (each  a 
“Warrant”), to acquire an equivalent number of common shares of the Company (each a “Warrant Share”), at an exercise 
price of $0.60 per Warrant Share and for an exercise period of up to September 25, 2010.  The Company retained the right to 
redeem the convertible promissory notes at any time upon giving certain notice to the holder(s), and subject to paying a 20% 
premium. 
In accordance with EITF 98-5, "Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently 
Adjustable  Conversion  Ratios",  the  Company  determined  and  recognized  the  fair  value  of  the  embedded  beneficial 
conversion  feature  of  $75,999  as  additional  paid-in  capital  as  the  convertible  notes  were  issued  with  an  intrinsic  value 
conversion feature.

CONVERTIBLE NOTES (CONTINUED)
NOTE 6: 
In  accordance  with  EITF  00-27,  "Application  of  Issue  No.  98-5  to  Certain  Convertible  Instruments",  the  Company  has 
charged the beneficial conversion feature to additional paid-in capital.  In addition, the Company allocated the proceeds of 
issuance  between  the  convertible  debt  and  the  detachable  warrants  based  on  their  relative  fair  values.    Accordingly,  the 
Company recognized the relative fair value of the warrants of $61,935 as a component of stockholders' equity.  Additionally, 
for the nine months ended April 30, 2009 interest expense of $7,664 has been accreted increasing the carrying value of the 
convertible debentures to $19,730 as at April 30, 2009.  The fair value of the warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model with an expected life of eighteen months, a risk free interest rate of 0.17%, a dividend yield of 0%, and 
an expected volatility of 131%.

A  productive  well  is  an  exploratory  well,  development  well,  producing  well  or  well  capable  of  production,  but  does  not 
include a dry well.  A dry well, or a hole, is an exploratory or a development well found to be incapable of producing either 
oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well. 
A gross well is a well in which a working interest is owned, and a net well is the result obtained when the sum of fractional 
ownership working interests in gross wells equals one.  The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which a 
working interest is owned, and the number of net wells is the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells 
expressed  as  whole  numbers  and  fractions  thereof.    The  "completion"  of  a  well  means  the  installation  of  permanent 
equipment for the production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry hole, to the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate 
agency.

Production and Price History 
We  began  production  of  oil  in  August  2006  with  the  acquisition  of  the  Holt,  Strahan  and  McKay  leases  in  Franklin  and 
Richland Parish, Louisiana.  In November 2006, we completed the acquisition of the Welder lease in Calhoun County, Texas, 
which  produces  both  oil  and  gas.    The  effective  date  of  the  Welder  acquisition  was  August  1,  2006  and  accordingly, 
production results from the effective date through the closing date have been included in operating results.  The table below 
sets forth the net quantities of oil and gas production, net of royalties, attributable to us from initial production in August 
2006 through April 30, 2009.  For the purposes of this table, the following terms have the following meanings: (i) "Bbl" 
means one stock tank barrel or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume; (ii) "MBbls" means one thousand barrels of oil; (iii) "Mcf" 
means one thousand cubic feet; (iv) "Mcfe" means one thousand cubic feet equivalent, determined using the ratio of nine Mcf 
of natural gas to one Bbl of oil; (v) "MMcfe/d" means one million cubic feet equivalent per day, determined by using the 
ratio of nine Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil; and (vi) "MMcf" means one million cubic feet.

Net production includes only production that is owned by us, whether directly or beneficially, and produced to our interest, 
less royalties and production due to others.  Production of natural gas includes only marketable production of gas on an "as 
sold"  basis.    Production  of  natural  gas  includes  only  dry,  residue  and  wet  gas,  depending  on  whether  liquids  have  been 
extracted before we passed title, and does not include flared gas, injected gas and gas consumed in operations.  Recovered 
gas, lift gas and reproduced gas are not included until sold. 
Drilling Activity 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have participated in one (1) drilling venture with Brayton Operating Company 
based in Corpus Christi, Texas.  A 12.5% working interested was purchased in a middle-lower Frio test (Meeks No. B-1), 
Victoria County, Texas.  The prospect was based on 3-D seismic data and adjacent well information.  The well was drilled, 
logged and plugged as indicated gas sands were deemed uneconomic.  We have completed five (5) workovers of producing 
or  previously  producing  wells  on  our  leases  in  the  Delhi  South  and  Big  Creek  fields  in  Richland  and  Franklin  Parishes, 
Louisiana.  We also participated in the side-track re-entry on the Janssen No. A-1 in Karnes County, Texas.  All producing 
wells in Louisiana are operated for us by Tradestar Energy, Inc. ("Tradestar") based in Hot Springs, Arizona.  The Welder 
(Barge Canal) wells are operated for us by Carter E&P, LLC, based in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The Janssen lease (Karnes Co., 
Texas)  is  operated  by  PROEX  Energy  Management  Company  ("Proex")  based  in  Houston,  Texas.    We  pay  a  monthly 
management fee to the operating companies for their services. 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have also drilled one horizontal well in the Little Mule Creek prospect (R&R 
Cattle No. 1-19) in Section 19, T29N, R12W, Alfalfa County, Oklahoma.

Our Properties 
Barge Canal, Texas 
On November 16, 2006 we completed an assignment and purchase agreement with OPEX Energy, LLC with an effective 
date of August 1, 2006.  Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a 100% working interest (90% after payout) and a 
72.5% net revenue interest (65.25% after payout) in approximately 81 acres of an oil and gas lease (the "Welder Lease") 
located in Calhoun County, Texas.  At the time of the acquisition, the two wells on the Welder lease were producing assets. 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, two wells are producing gas and oil from the property.  The wells are operated using a 
gas lift system.  A third well is utilized for salt water disposal.  The wells have additional proven non-producing zones behind 
pipe.  We intend to develop the proved developed non-producing (PDNP) zones as current producing horizons deplete. 
South Delhi/Big Creek Field, Louisiana 
On  August  24,  2006,  we  entered  into  an  assignment  of  oil  and  gas  interests  purchase  agreement  with  Energy  Program 
Accompany, LLC (the "EPA Purchase Agreement").  At the time of the acquisition, one of four wells on the Holt lease, the 
one well on the Strahan lease, and no wells on the McKay lease were producing assets.  Under the terms of the EPA Purchase 
Agreement, we paid $250,000 to acquire the Holt Lease, the Strahan Lease and the McKay Lease, as described below. 
The Holt Lease 
Pursuant  to  the  EPA  Purchase  Agreement,  we  acquired  a  97%  working  interest  and  an  81.25%  net  revenue  interest  in 
approximately 136 acres in Franklin Parish, Louisiana (the "Holt Lease").  In the months following the acquisition, we re-
worked the Holt No. 10 well, pulling the well and replacing the rods, tubing and downhole pump.  For Holt No. 24, we pulled 
the well, replaced the rods, tubing and downhole pump.  On Holt No. 22, we pulled the well, replaced the tubing, rods and 
downhole pump.  We also installed new surface pumping unit (320 pump jack).  For the salt water disposal well, we cleaned 
up and installed a new triplex pump.  We built new all weather roads to wells and built new tank battery (oil storage tanks 
and separators) for Holt No. 22 and 24.  We also buried flow lines (oil and salt water), installed overhead power to all wells 
with  transformer  capable  of  handling  additional  load  (wells),  removed  old  tanks  and  separators,  and  built  an  equipment 
storage location. 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are producing oil from the Holt No.'s 10 and 22 wells.  The Holt No. 4 and 24 
wells are off-line pending workover or offset drilling.  The Holt No. 15 well is utilized as a salt water disposal well. 
The Strahan Lease 
Pursuant  to  the  EPA  Purchase  Agreement,  we  acquired  a  100%  working  interest  and  an  81.25%  net  revenue  interest  in 
approximately 40 acres in Richland Parish, Louisiana (the "Strahan Lease"). 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are producing oil from the Strahan No. 1 well. 
The McKay Lease 
Pursuant  to  the  EPA  Purchase  Agreement,  we  acquired  a  100%  working  interest  and  an  82.08%  net  revenue  interest  in 
approximately 80 acres in Richland Parish, Louisiana (the "McKay Lease").  On the McKay lease, we re-worked the well but 
did not improve production.  On November 1, 2008 we assigned 100% of our interest in and to the McKay No. 1 well bore 
and  leasehold.    Pursuant  to  the  Assignment  Agreement,  we  retained  ownership  to  all  surface  equipment,  which  was 
subsequently  moved  to  our  Holt  Lease  in  Franklin  Parish.    Additionally,  all  plugging  liabilities  were  transferred  to  the 
purchaser and we retained no ORRI or working interest in the McKay No. 1 well. 
Assignment of Interests to Tradestar Resources Corporation 
In conjunction with our acquisition of the Holt Lease, the Strahan Lease and the McKay Lease, we assigned a 25% working 
interest with respect to each lease to Tradestar Resources Corporation as a finders fee.  The 25% working interest consisted of 
two parts, (i) a 12.5% working interest assigned upon acquisition of the leases, and (ii) a 12.5% back in assigned with an 
effective date of January 1, 2007.  Tradestar Energy Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tradestar Resources Corporation, 
became the operator of record for the Holt, Strahan and McKay Leases as of December 1, 2007. 
Janssen Lease, Texas 
In October 2005, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 25% working interest and an 18.75% net revenue interest in 
approximately 138 acres of an oil and gas lease (the "Janssen Lease") located in Karnes County, Texas.  This lease interest 
was acquired from Rockwell Energy.  An unsuccessful attempt was made to re-enter and re-complete a Roeder gas sand at 
10,300 feet using side track drilling techniques.  As the original lease was set to expire, we negotiated a new oil and gas lease 
with the mineral owners and farmed out 100% of the working interest to ETG Energy Resources.  We retained a 3% working 
interest on any producing zones and a 5% non-promoted option to participate in any offset drilling within the leased area.  
ETG successfully re-completed in the Roeder Sand and the Janssen A-1 well is currently producing between 250-300 mcf gas 
per day and approximately nine (6) barrels per day of condensate.

Koliba Lease, Texas 
Through the date of this Quarterly Report, we have entered into to several lease agreements with certain mineral owners of a 
79 acre tract, and purchased an assignment of leases on an adjoining 64 (the "Koliba Lease") in Victoria County, Texas.  To 
date,  we  have  leased  over  95%  of  the  minerals  with  additional  leases  pending.    The  property  underlying  these  lease 
agreements is located near our Welder lease and has one shut-in oil/gas well.  The well has proven oil and gas zones behind 
pipe that previously produced 30 Bbls oil per day plus water.  The well is in close proximity to our Welder gas sales line and 
salt water disposal system.  We will drill one well as an offset to the former Koliba No. 1 well, and will retain a carried 25% 
interest to casing point. 
Little Mule Creek Project, Oklahoma 
In October 2007, we entered into an agreement with Marmik Oil Company ("Marmik") of Eldorado, Arkansas to purchase a 
4.0% working interest in the Little Mule Creek Project located in Alfalfa and Woods Counties, Oklahoma.  Our interest is 
subject to a 25% back in after payout, which would reduce our interest to 3.0%.  The prospect consists of nearly 11,550 acres.  
An  initial  horizontal  well  was  spudded  in  around  January  9,  2008 and  is  at  3,720  feet  through  the  date  of  this  Quarterly 
Report.  The well is planned to be drilled vertically to 4,950 feet and then drilled horizontally approximately 1,867 feet to a 
total vertical depth of approximately 5350 feet.  The main target zone is the Maquoketa dolomitic shale.  The Maquoketa 
zone produces from a number of vertical wells in the lease area, but this will be the first horizontal drilling in the field.  There 
are  approximately  160  drilling  locations  within  the  current  leased  area.    In  addition  to  the  Maquoketa  zone,  three  other 
potentially productive zones are present in the prospect area: Tonkawa Sands at 4,500 feet, Mississippian Chat at 4,900 feet 
and Misner Sand at 5,000 feet.  The initial well (RRCC#1-19), was drilled and tested and deemed to be uneconomic for 
commercial oil and gas production,  and will be plugged in second quarter 2009.  Accordingly, acquisition and development 
costs of $163,773 were impaired during the period and added to the full cost pool, which is amortized on a unit-of-production 
basis. 
Recent Activities 
Much of the developed leasehold in Louisiana is adjacent to offset production.  A number of offset in-field drilling locations 
are indicated.  Additionally, Denbury Resources, Inc. (NYSE: DNR) has acquired a substantial acreage position in the Delhi-
Holt-Bryant Unit in the immediate area of our holdings.  Denbury has begun work to institute a tertiary carbon dioxide flood 
and are shooting 3-D seismic in the immediate area of our leases.  We are currently negotiating to purchase a 220 acre lease 
containing  five  wells  and  one  salt  water  disposal  well  in  the  area  of  our  Strahan  and  McKay  Leases  (Richland  Parish, 
Louisiana).  Additionally, we are negotiating on approximately 160 acres of leases adjacent to our Holt lease in Franklin 
Parish, Louisiana. 
Our undeveloped acreage in the Illinois basin is adjacent to current or past producing wells.  Drilling and completion costs 
are lower than in many other producing basins and the net revenues are higher.  Our leases in Illinois average 87.5% net 
revenue  interest  with  100% working  interest.    Multiple  pay  zones  are  indicated  in  leasehold  areas  including  the Cypress, 
Levias,  Aux  Vases,  Ste.  Genevieve,  Salem,  Saint  Lewis  and  Warsaw  formations.    Maximum  drill  depths  will  be 
approximately 4,000 feet. 
Additionally, the potential for "reef" type structures is considered high in several of our leasehold areas.  Negotiations are 
underway with possible joint venture partners for the funding of 3-D seismic surveys in order to identify possible reef drilling 
targets.  We are also currently evaluating oil well logs, maps and other data in the Welder (Barge Canal) lease area (Texas).  
Initial reviews indicate the potential for possible offset drilling sites. 
We continue to review and evaluate submittals on properties in Louisiana, Texas, Illinois and other areas of the continental 
United States.

Shareholders’ equity 
At April 30, 2009 we had $2,773 in cash and a working capital deficit of $649,751.  We have financed our operations through 
proceeds from the private placement of equity securities and debt instruments.  We decreased net cash by $64,877 during the 
nine months ended April 30, 2009 compared to a decrease of $561,081 in net cash during the same period ended April 30, 
2008.  See “Plan of Operation and Funding” below.

Net  cash  used  in  operating  activities  during  the  nine  months  ended  April  30,  2009  was  $784,352  compared  to  $711,574 
during  the  same  period  ending  April  30,  2008.    Significant  operating  expenditures  during  the  current  period  included 
consulting fees, direct operating costs, in addition to management and professional fees. 
Financing Activities 
Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended April 30, 2009 was $825,209 compared to $420,300 
during the same period ending April 30, 2008.  During the current period, we received net proceeds of $451,150 from private

Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended April 30, 2009 was $105,734 compared to $269,807 in the

in full.  The exercise of these options and warrants is at the discretion of the holders and, accordingly, there is no assurance 
that any of these options or warrants will be exercised.

Plan of Operation and Funding 
At April 30, 2009 we had $2,773 of cash on hand and a working capital deficit of $649,751.  As such, our working capital at 
April 30, 2009 will not be sufficient to enable us to pursue our lease operating costs, to pay our general and administrative 
expenses, and to pursue our plan of operations over the next twelve months.  We anticipate that we will require additional 
financing of approximately $2,600,000.  Our management is currently making efforts to obtain the required financing, but we 
have not yet secured any commitments with respect to such financing.  If we are not able to obtain financing in the amounts 
required or on terms that are acceptable to us, we may be forced to scale back, or abandon, our plan of operations. 
Various  conditions  outside  of  our  control  may  detract  from  our  ability  to  raise  the  capital  needed  to  execute  our  plan  of 
operations, including the price of oil as well as the overall market conditions in the international and local economies.  We 
recognize that the United States economy has suffered through a period of uncertainty during which the capital markets have 
been depressed from levels established twelve months ago, and that there is no certainty that these levels will stabilize or 
reverse.  We also recognize that the price of oil increased from approximately $30 per barrel in 2003 to over $140 per barrel 
in the summer of 2008 but has decreased to lows of below $40 in December 2008 and February 2009, and then increased to 
approximately $66 per barrel as of late May 2009.  If the price of oil continues to fluctuate significantly, we recognize that it 
will adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.  Any of these factors could have a material impact upon our ability 
to raise financing and, as a result, upon our short-term or long-term liquidity. 
Going Concern 
Our current sources of revenue are inadequate to provide incoming cash flows to sustain our future operations.  As outlined 
above, our ability to pursue our planned business activities is dependent upon our successful efforts to raise additional equity 
financing.    These  factors  raise  substantial  doubt  regarding  our  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.    Our  consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that we will continue to realize our assets 
and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business.  As at April 30, 2009 we had accumulated losses of $5,990,506 
since inception.  Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded 
asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 
Current Economic Conditions 
During  2008  and  the  beginning  of  2009,  particularly  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008,  the  ongoing  global  credit  crisis  and 
economic weakness have made for extremely volatile capital markets characterized by plunging equity and commodity prices 
and an environment in which few opportunities exist to raise additional capital.  We have taken precautions where we can, 
and implemented initiatives to preserve our cash resources.  We will be reviewing our operating activities, exploration plans 
and  capital  position  on  an  ongoing  basis  during  fiscal  2009  and  may  revise  our  operations  or  abandon  properties  if 
management deems it necessary in order to maintain the long-term viability of the Company. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely 
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of 
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
Critical Accounting Policies 
Our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States 
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements.  In 
general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on 
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.  Actual results could differ 
from those estimates made by management. 
We  believe  that  our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  include  the  accounting  for  accounts  receivable,  marketable 
securities and long-lived assets reclamation costs, and accounting for legal contingencies. 
See  Note  2 of  the  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  for  our nine  months  ended  April  30,  2009 for  a  summary  of 
significant accounting policies.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

this report, based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d015. 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
This  Quarterly  Report  does  not  include  a  report  of  management's  assessment  regarding  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting or an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by 
the rules of the SEC for newly public companies. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of our fiscal year ended 
July 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
On  June 6, 2008, Glasscell  Morris  and  Margie  L.  Morris  (the  "Petitioners") filed  a petition with  the  Fifth District  Court, 
Parish  of  Franklin,  Louisiana,  naming  the  following  as  defendants:  Penasco  Petroleum,  Inc.  (which  is  a  wholly  owned 
subsidiary  of  Strategic  American  Oil  Corporation),  Tradestar  Energy,  Inc.  and  the  Unopened  Succession  of  Walter  Leon 
Girod.  The Petitioners allege: (i) that Mr. Girod was the owner of a 40-acre tract (the "Property") located in Franklin Parish, 
Louisiana; (ii) that an oil well (serial number 141591, which is referred to elsewhere in this annual report as Holt No. 22) was 
completed on the Property in 1973; (iii) that the Petitioners purchased the Property from Mr. Girod in 1988 but Mr. Girod 
reserved to himself all of the oil, gas and other minerals located in, under or on the Property; (iv) that the well produced no 
oil or gas from October 1992 through October 2002; (v) that no revenues were distributed to Mr. Girod or to the Petitioners 
since 1992; (vi) that Mr. Girod, who never married and had no children, died in 2000 but no succession has been opened; and 
(vii)  that  with  Petitioners'  permission,  Penasco  and  Tradestar  began  production  of  the  well  on  the  Property  on  or  about 
January 1, 2007.  The Petitioners are seeking a declaration that they are the owners of the mineral rights of the Property, that 
they  should  be  paid  royalties  (and  interest  thereon)  with  respect  to  any  oil,  gas  or  minerals  generated  by  the  well  from 
January 1, 2007 until the date of judgment, and that they should be paid any such future royalties from the date of judgment 
forward.  Penasco's participation in the Holt No. 22 well will not be affected regardless of whether the Petitioners are or are 
not named as successors to Mr. Girod's royalty interests. 
The hearing on Glasscell Morris’ complaint was held on August 7, 2008, resulting in Mr. Morris becoming the successor in 
interest to Walter Girod, with no change in interest owned by Penasco Petroleum.  Mr. Morris was required to execute a lease 
in favor of Penasco Petroleum, Inc. allowing for a 1/8 royalty on production and no bonus, with Penasco Petroleum agreeing 
not to construct buildings on the Morris property. 
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or 
(ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceeding.  Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or 
that have been threatened against us or our properties.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
Except for the risk factor outlined below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in 
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2008 which was filed with the SEC on November 13, 2008. 
Recent  market  events  and  conditions,  including  disruptions  in  the  U.S.  and  international  credit  markets  and  other 
financial systems and the deterioration of the U.S. and global economic conditions, has, among other things, impeded 
access to capital or increased the cost of capital, which had had an adverse effect on our ability to fund our working 
capital and other capital requirements. 
In 2007 and into 2008, the U.S. credit markets began to experience serious disruption due to a deterioration in residential 
property  values,  defaults  and  delinquencies  in  the  residential  mortgage  market  (particularly,  subprime  and  non-prime 
mortgages)  and  a  decline  in  the  credit  quality  of  mortgage  backed  securities.    These  problems  led  to  a  slow-down  in 
residential  housing  market  transactions,  declining  housing  prices,  delinquencies  in  non-mortgage  consumer  credit  and  a 
general decline in consumer confidence.  These conditions continued and worsened in 2008, causing a loss of confidence in 
the broader U.S. and global credit and financial markets and resulting in the collapse of, and government intervention in, 
major banks, financial institutions and insurers and creating a climate of greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit 
spreads, a lack of price transparency, increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions.  Notwithstanding various actions 
by  the  U.S.  and  foreign  governments,  concerns  about  the  general  condition  of  the  capital  markets,  financial  instruments, 
banks, investment banks, insurers and other financial institutions caused the broader credit markets to further deteriorate and 
stock  markets  to  decline  substantially.    In  addition,  general  economic  indicators  have  deteriorated,  including  declining 
consumer sentiment, increased unemployment and declining economic growth and uncertainty about corporate earnings. 
These unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on 
a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies.  These disruptions have, 
among other things, made it more difficult for us to obtain, and have increased our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for 
our operations.  Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
