SYNERGY RESOURCES CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization:  Synergy Resources Corporation (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is engaged
in oil and gas acquisition, exploration, development, and production activities, primarily in the
Denver-Julesburg Basin ("D-J Basin") of Colorado. The Company’s common stock is listed and
traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol "SYRG."
Basis of Presentation:  The Company operates in one business segment, and all of its operations
are located in the United States of America.
At the directive of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to use "plain English" in
public filings, the Company will use such terms as "we," "our," or the "Company" in place of
Synergy Resources Corporation. When such terms are used in this manner throughout this
document, they are in reference only to the corporation, Synergy Resources Corporation, and are
not used in reference to the Board of Directors, corporate officers, management, or any individual
employee or group of employees.
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").
Change of Year End: On February 25, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved a
change in fiscal year end from August 31 to December 31 effective with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2016. The prior year figures presented herein have been recast to conform to the
new fiscal year end.
Interim Financial Information:  The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC as promulgated in Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  The condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company's
Transition Report on Form 10-K for the four months ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the
SEC on April 22, 2016.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations.  The Company believes that the disclosures
included are adequate to make the information presented not misleading and recommends that
these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the four months ended December 31, 2015.
In our opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein
reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring items, which are necessary for the
fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows on a
basis consistent with that of its prior audited financial statements.  However, the results of
operations for interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal
year. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date of this filing.
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,
Major Customers: The Company sells production to a limited number of customers. Customers
representing 10% or more of our oil and gas revenue for each of the periods presented are
shown in the following table:

Based on the current demand for oil and natural gas, the availability of other buyers, and the
Company having the option to sell to other buyers if conditions warrant, the Company believes
that its oil and gas production can be sold in the market in the event that it is not sold to the
Company’s existing customers.
5
Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables from oil and gas sales and amounts due
from other working interest owners who are liable for their proportionate share of well costs. The
Company typically has the right to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover outstanding
joint interest billings on outstanding receivables from joint interest owners.

The Company operates exclusively within the United States of America and, except for cash and
short-term investments, all of the Company’s assets are utilized in, and all of its revenues are
derived from, the oil and gas industry.
Goodwill: The Company’s goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized
and is tested for impairment annually or whenever other circumstances or events indicate that the
carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When evaluating goodwill for impairment,
the Company may first perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if the fair value
of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying amount. If, based on the
review of the qualitative factors, the Company determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the required two-step impairment test
can be bypassed. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of
the reporting unit is not more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying value, the Company must
perform the first step of the two-step impairment test and calculate the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, there is
an indication that impairment may exist, and the second step must be performed to measure the
amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the amount by
which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. As a
result of declining oil prices, the Company performed an interim goodwill test as of March 31,
2016 which did not result in an impairment. The Company utilized a market approach in
estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. The primary assumptions used in the Company's
impairment evaluations are based on the best available market information at the time and reflect
significant management judgments. Changes in these assumptions or future economic
conditions could impact the Company's conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and
potentially result in a non-cash impairment loss in a future period.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:   We evaluate the pronouncements of various
authoritative accounting organizations to determine the impact of new accounting
pronouncements on us.
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"), which intends to improve the accounting for share-based payment
transactions. The ASU changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
award transactions, including: (1) Accounting and Cash Flow Classification for Excess Tax
Benefits and Deficiencies, (2) Forfeitures, and (3) Tax Withholding Requirements and Cash Flow
Classification. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public businesses for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We
are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02"), which
establishes a comprehensive new lease standard designed to increase transparency and
comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the
balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In transition, lessees
and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period
presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach
includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. An entity that
elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that
commence before the effective date in accordance with previous US GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is
effective for public business for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
6
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)" ("ASU 2014-09"), which establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard
designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the
consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so,
companies may need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current
revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 allows for the use of either the full or modified
retrospective transition method, and the standard will be effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within that period, with early
adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are
currently evaluating which transition approach to use and the impact of the adoption of this
standard on our consolidated financial statements.
There were various updates recently issued by the FASB, most of which represented technical
corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected
to a have a material impact on our reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

The Company periodically reviews its oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying value of
such assets exceeds estimated fair value. For proved producing and non-producing properties,
the Company performs a ceiling test each quarter to determine whether there has been an
impairment to its capitalized costs. Under the ceiling test, the value of the Company’s reserves is
calculated using the average of the published spot prices for WTI oil (per barrel) as of the first day
of each of the previous twelve months, as well as the average of the published spot prices for
Henry Hub (per MMBtu) as of the first day of each of the previous twelve months, each adjusted
by lease or field for quality, transportation fees, and regional price differentials. As a result of
these periodic reviews, the Company concluded that its net capitalized costs of oil and natural
gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount, resulting in the recognition of ceiling test
impairments totaling $189.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. During the six
months ended June 30, 2015, the Company's ceiling tests resulted in total impairments of $3.0
million.
The Company also reviews the fair value of its unproved properties. The reviews as of June 30,
2016 indicated that the carrying values of such assets exceeded the estimated fair values.
Therefore, $17.7 million of costs were moved into the full cost pool and subject to the
aforementioned ceiling test. No such impairments were recognized during the six months ended
June 30, 2015.

Capitalized Overhead: A portion of the Company’s overhead expenses are directly attributable to
acquisition, exploration, and development activities.  Under the full cost method of accounting,
these expenses, in the amounts shown in the table below, were capitalized in the full cost pool

3.Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
The Company acquired certain oil and gas and other assets that affect the comparability between
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as described below.
On February 4, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets for a total
purchase price of $10.0 million. The acquisition comprised solely of undeveloped oil and gas
leasehold interests in the D-J Basin of Colorado. The purpose of the transaction was to provide
additional mineral acres upon which the Company could drill wells and produce hydrocarbons.
The purchase price has been allocated as $8.6 million to proved oil and gas properties and $1.4
million to unproved oil and gas properties on a preliminary basis and includes significant use of
estimates.
GC Acquisition
On May 2, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement ("GC Agreement") with a large
publicly-traded company, pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire approximately 72,000
gross (33,100 net) acres in an area referred to as the Greeley-Crescent project in the Wattenberg
Field for $505 million (the "GC Acquisition").  Estimated net daily production from the properties
to be acquired was approximately 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent ("BOE") at the time of entering
into the GC Agreement. The acquisition will have two separate closing dates. On June 14, 2016,
the Company closed on the portion of the assets comprised of the undeveloped oil and gas
leasehold interests and non-operated production. The effective date of this part of the transaction
was April 1, 2016. The second closing will cover the operated producing properties and is
expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017. For this part of the
transaction, the effective date will be April 1, 2016 for the horizontal wells to be acquired, and the
first day of the calendar month in which the closing for such properties occurs for the vertical
wells. The second closing is subject to certain closing conditions, including the receipt of
regulatory approval. Accordingly, the second closing of the transaction may not close in the
expected time frame or at all.
The first closing on June 14, 2016 was for a total purchase price of $487.3 million, net of
customary closing adjustments. The purchase price was composed of $486.3 million in cash plus
the assumption of certain liabilities.
The first closing encompassed approximately 33,100 net acres of oil and gas leasehold interests
and related assets in the D-J Basin of Colorado and net production of approximately 800 BOE
per day ("BOED") at the time of entering into the GC Agreement. The purpose of the transaction
was to provide additional mineral acres upon which the Company could drill wells and produce
hydrocarbons.
8
The first closing was accounted for using the acquisition method under ASC 805, Business
Combinations, which requires the acquired assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair values as
of the acquisition date of June 14, 2016. Transaction costs of $0.1 million related to the
acquisition were expensed as incurred. The following allocation of the purchase price is
preliminary and includes significant use of estimates.  The fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are preliminary and are subject to revision as the Company continues to
evaluate the fair value of this acquisition.  Accordingly, the allocation will change as additional
information becomes available and is assessed, and the impact of such changes may be
material. The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price and preliminary
estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):

acquisition through cash, additional depreciation expense, costs directly attributable to the
acquisition, and operating costs incurred as a result of the assets acquired.  The pro forma results
do not include any cost savings or other synergies that may result from the acquisition or any
estimated costs that have been or will be incurred by the Company to integrate the properties
acquired.  The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have
occurred if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of the period, nor are they
necessarily indicative of future results.

KPK Acquisition
On October 20, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of certain assets ("KPK Acquisition")
from a private company for a total purchase price of $85.2 million, net of customary closing
adjustments. The purchase price was composed of $35.0 million in cash and $49.8 million in
restricted common stock plus the assumption of certain liabilities.
The KPK Acquisition encompassed approximately 4,300 net acres of oil and gas leasehold
interests and related assets in the D-J Basin of Colorado and net production of approximately
1,200 BOED at the time of purchase. The purpose of the transaction was to provide additional
mineral acres upon which the Company could drill wells and produce hydrocarbons.

Divestitures
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company closed on two transactions involving the
divestiture of approximately 3,700 net undeveloped acres and 107 vertical wells primarily in
Adams County, Colorado for total consideration of $27.1 million, subject to customary purchase
price adjustments. We received $23.5 million in cash and transferred liabilities of $0.5 million to
the buyers. The buyer of the undeveloped acreage has placed $3.1 million in cash in escrow
pending the final resolution of its due diligence procedures. The divested assets had associated
production of approximately 200 BOED at the time of sale. The vertical well transaction closed in
April 2016, and the undeveloped acreage transaction closed in June 2016.

volumes for the quarter to estimated total reserves at the beginning of the quarter. For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, production of 1,010 MBOE and 2,057 MBOE, respectively,
represented 1.0% and 2.0% of estimated total proved reserves, respectively. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015, production of 755 MBOE and 1,388 MBOE, respectively,
represented 1.6% and 2.9% of estimated total proved reserves, respectively. DD&A expense was
$11.16 per BOE and $20.84 per BOE for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, DD&A expense was $11.36 per

6.Revolving Credit Facility
The Company maintains a revolving credit facility ("Revolver") with a bank syndicate. The
Revolver is available for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
general corporate purposes, and to support letters of credit. As of June 30, 2016, the terms of the
Revolver provide for up to $500 million in borrowings, subject to a borrowing base limitation,
which was $145 million. As of June 30, 2016, there was no outstanding principal balance. The
maturity date of the Revolver is December 15, 2019.
On January 28, 2016, the Revolver was amended in connection with the semi-annual
redetermination. The borrowing base was reduced from $163 million to $145 million, and the
Revolver was further amended to (i) delete the minimum interest rate floor, (ii) delete the
minimum liquidity covenant, (iii) add a current ratio covenant of 1.0 to 1.0, and (iv) delete the
minimum
11
hedging requirement. In January 2016, the Company reduced its outstanding borrowings under
the Revolver from $78 million to nil.
Interest under the Revolver is payable monthly and accrues at a variable rate.  For each
borrowing, the Company designates its choice of reference rates, which can be either the Prime
Rate plus a margin or the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin. The interest
rate margin, as well as other bank fees, varies with utilization of the Revolver. The average
annual interest rate for borrowings during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was 2.63%.
Certain of the Company’s assets, including substantially all of the producing wells and
developed oil and gas leases, have been designated as collateral under the Revolver. The
borrowing commitment is subject to scheduled redeterminations on a semi-annual basis. If
certain events occur, or if the bank syndicate so elects, an unscheduled redetermination could be
prepared. As of June 30, 2016, based on a borrowing base of $145 million and no outstanding
principal balance, the unused borrowing base available for future borrowing totaled
approximately $145 million.  The next semi-annual redetermination is scheduled for November
2016.
The Revolver also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the payment of
dividends. Additionally, as of June 30, 2016, the Revolver required an overall commodity
derivative position that covers a rolling 24 months of estimated future production with a maximum
position of 85% of hydrocarbon production as projected in the semi-annual reserve report.
  
Furthermore, the Revolver requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial
and liquidity ratio covenants. Under the requirements, the Company, on a quarterly basis, must
not (a) at any time permit its ratio of total funded debt as of such time to EBITDAX, as defined in
the agreement, to be greater than or equal to 4.0 to 1.0; or (b) as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter permit its current ratio, as defined in the agreement, to be less than 1.0 to 1.0. As of
June 30, 2016, the most recent compliance date, the Company was in compliance with these
loan covenants and expects to remain in compliance throughout the next 12-month period.
7.Notes Payable
On June 14, 2016, the Company issued $80 million aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior
Unsecured Notes ("Senior Notes") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The
maturity for the payment of principal is June 13, 2021. Interest on the Notes accrues at 9.00% and
began accruing on June 14, 2016. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
beginning on December 15, 2016. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated
as of June 14, 2016 (the "Indenture") and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the
Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that incur or guarantee certain indebtedness,
including indebtedness under the revolving credit facility. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Senior Notes were $75.8 million after deductions of $4.2 million for expenses and underwriting
discounts and commissions. The net proceeds were used to fund the GC Acquisition as
discussed further in Note 3.
At any time prior to December 14, 2018, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Senior
Notes subject to the Make-Whole Price (as defined in the Indenture) and accrued and unpaid
interest.  On and after December 14, 2018, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Senior
Notes at the redemption price at a specified percentage of the principal amount of the redeemed
notes (104.50% for 2018, 102.25% for 2019, and 100.0% for 2020 and thereafter, during the
twelve-month period beginning on December 14 of each applicable year), plus accrued and
unpaid interest. Additionally, prior to December 14, 2018, the Company can, on one or more
occasions, redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes with all or a portion of
the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (as defined in the Indenture) at a
redemption price equal to 109.00% of the principal amount of the redeemed notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, subject to certain conditions.
The Indenture contains covenants that restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of certain of
its subsidiaries to, among other restrictions and limitations: (i) incur additional indebtedness;
(ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its or
their assets; (v) engage in transactions with affiliates; or (vi) engage in certain restricted business
activities.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications.
As of June 30, 2016, the most recent compliance date, the Company was in compliance with
these loan covenants and expects to remain in compliance throughout the next 12-month period.

8.Commodity Derivative Instruments
The Company has entered into commodity derivative instruments, as described below. Our
commodity derivative instruments may include but are not limited to "collars," "swaps," and "put"
positions. Our derivative strategy, including the volume amounts, whether we utilize oil and/or
natural gas instruments, and the relevant commodity prices, is based in part on our view of
expected future market conditions and our analysis of well-level economic return potential. In
addition, our use of derivative contracts is subject to stipulations set forth in the Revolver.
A "put" option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying commodity at
a specified price (strike price) within a specific time period. Depending on market conditions,
strike prices, and the value of the contracts, we may, at times, purchase put options, which
require us to pay premiums at the time we purchase the contracts. These premiums represent the
fair value of the purchased put as of the date of purchase. Conversely, a "call" option gives the
owner the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying commodity at a specified price
(strike price) within a specific time period.
Depending on market conditions, strike prices, and the value of the contracts, we may, at times,
sell call options in conjunction with the purchase of put options to create "collars." We regularly
utilize "no premium" (a.k.a. zero cost) collars where we receive the difference between the
published index price and a floor price if the index price is below the floor. We pay the difference
between the ceiling price and the index price if the index price is above the contracted ceiling
price. No amounts are paid or received if the index price is between the floor and the ceiling
price.
Additionally, at times, we may enter into swaps. Swaps are derivative contracts which obligate
two counterparties to effectively trade the underlying commodity at a set price over a specified
term.
The Company may, from time to time, add incremental derivatives to cover additional production,
restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of
current contracts in order to realize the current value of the Company’s existing positions. The
Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable
to meet the financial terms of such contracts. The Company’s derivative contracts are currently
with four counterparties and an exchange. Two of the counterparties are lenders in the Revolver.
The Company has netting arrangements with the counterparties that provide for the offset of
payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with the counterparty in the
event of contract termination. The derivative contracts may be terminated by a non-defaulting
party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement.
The Company’s commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as commodity derivative assets or liabilities.
Unrealized gains and losses are recorded based on the changes in the fair values of the
derivative instruments. Both the unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from contract
settlement of derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The
Company’s cash flow is only impacted when the actual settlements under commodity derivative
contracts result in making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty. Actual cash
settlements can occur at either the scheduled maturity date of the contract or at an earlier date if
the contract is liquidated prior to its scheduled maturity. These settlements under the commodity
derivative contracts are reflected as operating activities in the Company’s consolidated
statements of cash flows.

Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all derivative instruments held by the Company
were subject to enforceable master netting arrangements held by various financial institutions. In
general, the terms of the Company’s agreements provide for offsetting of amounts payable or
receivable between the Company and the counterparty, at the election of either party, for
transactions that occur on the same date and in the same currency. The Company’s agreements
also provide that, in the event of an early termination, each party has the right to offset amounts
owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. The Company’s
accounting policy is to offset these positions in its consolidated balance sheets.

Credit Related Contingent Features
As of June 30, 2016, two of the five counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments were
members of the Company’s credit facility syndicate. The Company’s obligations under the credit
facility and its derivative contracts are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company’s
producing oil and gas properties. The agreement with the third and fourth counterparties, which
are not lenders under the credit facility, are unsecured and do not require the posting of collateral.
The agreement with the fifth counterparty is subject to an inter-creditor agreement between the
counterparty and the Company’s lenders under the credit facility.
9.Fair Value Measurements
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, establishes a hierarchy for inputs
used in measuring fair value for financial assets and liabilities that maximizes the use of
observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most
observable inputs be used when available.  Observable inputs are inputs that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Company.  Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s
assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the
best information available in the circumstances.  The hierarchy is broken down into three levels
based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:
•
•Level 1: Quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities that are observable for
the asset or liability; and
Level 3: Unobservable pricing inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources,
such as discounted cash or valuation models.
•
The financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a
particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of
the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
The Company’s non-recurring fair value measurements include asset retirement obligations and
purchase price allocations for the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired through business
combinations.
The Company determines the estimated fair value of its asset retirement obligations by
calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to plugging and abandonment
liabilities using Level 3 inputs. The significant inputs used to calculate such liabilities include
estimates of costs to be incurred, the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free rate, inflation rates, and
estimated dates of abandonment. The asset retirement liability is accreted to its present value
each period, and the capitalized asset retirement cost is depleted as a component of the full cost
pool using the units-of-production method. See Note 5 for additional information.
The acquisition of a group of assets in a business combination transaction requires fair value
estimates for assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired through business combinations is calculated using a net discounted cash flow
approach for the producing properties. The discounted cash flows are developed using the
income approach and are based on management’s expectations for the future.  Unobservable
inputs include estimates of future oil and gas production from the Company’s reserve reports,
commodity prices based on the NYMEX forward price curves as of the date of the estimate
(adjusted for basis differentials), estimated operating and development costs, and a risk-adjusted
discount rate (all of which are designated as Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy). For
unproved properties, fair value is determined using market comparables. For the asset retirement
liability assumed, the fair value is determined using the same inputs as described in the
paragraph above. See Note 3 for additional information.
The following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by level within
the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

Commodity Derivative Instruments
The Company determines its estimate of the fair value of commodity derivative instruments using
a market approach based on several factors, including quoted market prices in active markets,
quotes from third parties, the credit rating of each counterparty, and the Company’s own credit
standing. In consideration of counterparty credit risk, the Company assessed the possibility of
whether the counterparties to its derivative contracts would default by failing to make any
contractually required payments. The Company considers the counterparties to be of substantial
credit quality and believes that they have the financial resources and willingness to meet their
potential repayment obligations associated with the derivative transactions. At June 30, 2016,
derivative instruments utilized by the Company consist of puts and collars. The crude oil and
natural gas derivative markets are highly active. Although the Company’s derivative instruments
are based on several factors, including public indices, the instruments themselves are primarily
traded with third-party counterparties. As such, the Company has classified these instruments as
Level 2.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, commodity derivative instruments (discussed above), notes
payable, and credit facility borrowings. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable are representative of their fair values due to their
short-term maturities. Due to the variable interest rate paid on the credit facility borrowings, the
carrying value is representative of its fair value.
The fair value of the notes payable is estimated to be $78.4 million at June 30, 2016. The
Company determined the fair value of its notes payable at June 30, 2016 by using observable
market based information for debt instruments of similar amounts and duration. The Company
has classified the notes as Level 2.

as described further below.
Sales of common stock
In January 2016, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock in an
underwritten public offering. The Company agreed to sell 14,000,000 shares of its common stock
to the Underwriters at a price of $5.545 per share. In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting
Agreement, the Underwriters were granted an option, exercisable within 30 days, to purchase up
to an additional 2,100,000 shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions. The
option was exercised on January 26, 2016, bringing the total number of shares issued to
16,100,000. Net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and
expenses payable by the Company, were $89.2 million. Proceeds were used to repay amounts
borrowed under the Revolver and general corporate purposes, which included continuing to
develop our acreage position in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and funding a portion of our
2016 capital expenditure program.
In April 2016, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock in an underwritten
public offering. The Company agreed to sell 19,500,000 shares of its common stock to the
Underwriters at a price of $7.3535 per share. In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting
Agreement, the Underwriters were granted an option, exercisable within 30 days, to purchase up
to an additional 2,925,000 shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions. The
option was exercised on April 12, 2016, bringing the total number of shares issued to 22,425,000.
Net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses payable
by the Company, were $164.8 million. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the
offering to pay a portion of the purchase price of the GC Acquisition described in Note 3.
In May 2016, the Company completed a public offering of its common stock in an underwritten
public offering. The Company agreed to sell 45,000,000 shares of its common stock to the
Underwriters at a price of $5.597 per share. In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement,
the Underwriters were granted an option, exercisable within 30 days, to purchase up to an
additional 6,750,000 shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions. The option was
exercised on June 6, 2016, bringing the total number of shares issued to 51,750,000. Net
proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses payable by
the Company, were $289.4 million. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the offering
to pay a portion of the purchase price of the GC Acquisition described in Note 3.
12.Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of the Company.  The
number of potential shares outstanding relating to stock options, performance stock units, and
non-vested restricted stock units and stock bonus shares is computed using the treasury stock
method.  Potentially dilutive securities outstanding are not included in the calculation when such
securities would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

13.Stock-Based Compensation
In addition to cash compensation, the Company may compensate certain service providers,
including employees, directors, consultants, and other advisors, with equity-based compensation
in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, stock bonus shares, warrants, and other equity
awards.  The Company records its equity compensation by pro-rating the estimated grant date
fair value of each grant over the period of time that the recipient is required to provide services to
the Company (the "vesting phase").  The calculation of fair value is based, either directly or
indirectly, on the quoted market value of the Company’s common stock.  Indirect valuations are
calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model or a Monte Carlo Model. For the
periods presented, all stock-based compensation was classified either as a component within
general and administrative expense in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, or,
for that portion which is directly attributable to individuals performing acquisition, exploration, and
development activities, was capitalized to the full cost pool.

Restricted stock units and stock bonus awards
The Company grants restricted stock units and stock bonus awards to directors, eligible
employees and officers as a part of its equity incentive plan.  Restrictions and vesting periods for
the awards are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and are set
forth in the award agreements. Each restricted stock unit or stock bonus award
represents one share of the Company’s common stock to be released from restrictions upon
completion of the vesting period. The awards typically vest in equal increments over three to five
years. Restricted stock units and stock bonus awards are valued at the closing price of the
Company’s common stock on the grant date and are recognized over the vesting period of the
award.

Performance-vested stock units
In March 2016, the Company granted performance-vested stock units ("PSUs") to certain
executives under its long term incentive plan. The number of shares of the Company’s common
stock that may be issued to settle PSUs ranges from zero to two times the number of PSUs
awarded. The shares issued for PSUs are determined based on the Company’s performance
over a three-year measurement period and vest in their entirety at the end of the measurement
period. The PSUs will be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock following the end of
the three-year performance cycle. Any PSUs that have not vested at the end of the applicable
measurement period are forfeited. The vesting criterion for the PSUs is based on a comparison of
the Company’s total shareholder return ("TSR") for the measurement period compared with the
TSRs of a group of peer companies for the same measurement period. As the vesting criterion is
linked to the Company's share price, it is considered a market condition for purposes of
calculating the grant-date fair value of the awards.
The fair value of the PSUs was measured at the grant date with a stochastic process method
using a Monte Carlo simulation. A stochastic process is a mathematically defined equation that
can create a series of outcomes over time. These outcomes are not deterministic in nature, which
means that by iterating the equations multiple times, different results will be obtained for those
iterations. In the case of the Company’s PSUs, the Company cannot predict with certainty the
path its stock price or the stock prices of its peers will take over the performance period. By using
a stochastic simulation, the Company can create multiple prospective stock pathways,
statistically analyze these simulations, and ultimately make inferences regarding the most likely
path the stock price will take. As such, because future stock prices are stochastic, or probabilistic
with some direction in nature, the stochastic method, specifically the Monte Carlo Model, is
deemed an appropriate method by which to determine the fair value of the PSUs. Significant
assumptions used in this simulation include the Company’s expected volatility, risk-free interest
rate based on U.S. Treasury yield curve rates with maturities consistent with the measurement
period, as well as the volatilities for each of the Company’s peers.

14.Income Taxes
We evaluate and update our estimated annual effective income tax rate on a quarterly basis
based on current and forecasted operating results and tax laws. Consequently, based upon the
mix and timing of our actual earnings compared to annual projections, our effective tax rate may
vary quarterly and may make quarterly comparisons not meaningful. A tax expense or benefit
unrelated to the current year income or loss is recognized in its entirety as a discrete item of tax in
the period identified. The quarterly income tax provision is generally comprised of tax expense
on income or benefit on loss at the most recent estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for
the effect of discrete items.
The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was 0% compared to 39% for the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is
based upon a full year forecasted tax provision and differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to
the recognition of a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The effective tax
rate for the six months ended June 30, 2015 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state
taxes and nondeductible officers' compensation, partially offset by percentage depletion. There
were no significant discrete items recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015.
As of June 30, 2016, we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes
that there are no new items, nor changes in facts or judgments that should impact the Company’s
tax position.  Given the substantial NOL carryforwards at both the federal and state levels, it is
anticipated that any changes resulting from a tax examination would simply adjust the
carryforwards, and would not result in significant interest expense or penalties.  Most of the
Company's tax returns filed since August 31, 2011 are still subject to examination by tax
authorities. As of the date of this report, we are current with our income tax filings in all applicable
state jurisdictions, and we are not currently under any state income tax examinations.
No significant uncertain tax positions were identified as of any date on or before June 30,
2016.  The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
benefits in income tax expense.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company has not recognized any
interest or penalties related to uncertain tax benefits.
Each period, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Based upon our cumulative losses through June 30,
2016, we have provided a full valuation allowance reducing the net realizable benefits.

15.Related Party Transactions
Consulting agreements: Subsequent to their tenure as co-CEOs, which ended on December 31,
2015, the Company entered into consulting agreements with Ed Holloway and William Scaff, Jr.
through May 31, 2016. During this period, each was paid $70,000 per month, or $140,000 and
$350,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
16.Other Commitments and Contingencies
Volume Commitments
During 2014, the Company entered into crude oil transportation agreements with three
counterparties and a volume commitment to a third party refiner. Deliveries under two of the
transportation agreements commenced during 2015. Deliveries under the third transportation
agreement are not expected to commence until late in 2016. The third party refinery volume
commitment expired on December 31, 2015.
Pursuant to these agreements, we must deliver specific amounts of crude oil either from our own
production or from oil we acquire from third parties. If we are unable to fulfill all of our contractual
obligations, we may be required to pay penalties or damages pursuant to these agreements. As
of June 30, 2016, our commitments over the next five years are as follows:

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred transportation deficiency
charges of $300,000 as we were unable to meet all of the obligations during the quarter. As of
June 30, 2016, our current production exceeds our delivery obligations.
Office and yard leases
The Company leases its Platteville offices and other facilities from HS Land & Cattle, LLC
("HSLC"). HSLC is controlled by Ed Holloway and William Scaff, Jr., members of the Company's
board of directors through June 22, 2016.  The most recent lease, dated June 30, 2014, is
currently on a month-to-month basis and requires payments of $15,000 per month. In July 2016,
the Company entered into a new office lease in Greeley with an unrelated party with the intention
of canceling the Platteville office lease once the move is completed. The Greeley office lease will
require monthly payments of approximately $7,500 and will terminate in October 2026. In
addition, the Company maintains its principal offices in Denver. The Denver office lease requires
monthly payments of approximately $30,000 and terminates in October 2016. The Company is
currently exploring its options for a new lease in Denver.
Litigation
From time to time, the Company is a party to various commercial and regulatory claims, pending
or threatened legal action, and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. It
is the opinion of management that none of the current matters of contention are reasonably likely
to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.
On June 1, 2015, the Company filed a complaint in the District Court of Weld County, Colorado,
against Briller, Inc., R.W.L. Enterprises and Robert W. Loveless (together, the "Defendants")
arising from a dispute concerning the validity of certain leases covering properties in Weld
County.  On June 23, 2015, the Defendants removed the case to the Federal District Court of
Colorado and filed an answer and counterclaims against the Company and two officers of the
Company. The officers have since been dismissed from the case, and the Court has ruled that
the Defendant's lease is valid. The essence of the Defendants’ counterclaims are that the
Company unlawfully drilled wells through properties leased by the Defendants causing physical
damage
23
and economic damages measured by the value of hydrocarbons under the Defendant's lease. To
date, no hydrocarbons have been produced from these wells. Although the Company believes
Defendants’ counterclaims are without merit, it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome
of this matter.
Environmental
Due to the nature of the natural gas and oil industry, we are exposed to environmental risks. We
have various policies and procedures to minimize and mitigate the risks from environmental
contamination. We conduct periodic reviews and simulated drills to identify changes in our
environmental risk profile. Liabilities are recorded when environmental damages resulting from
past events are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2016, we
had accrued environmental liabilities in the amount of $0.9 million, included in accounts payable
and accrued expenses on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  We are not aware of any
environmental claims existing as of June 30, 2016 which have not been provided for or would
otherwise have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, there can
be no assurance that current regulatory requirements will not change or that unknown past non-
compliance with environmental laws or unknown historic releases will not be discovered on our
properties.
    
In addition, in July 2016, we were informed by the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment's Air Quality Control Commission's Air Pollution Control Division ("CDPHE") that it
expects to expand its inspection of the Company's facilities in connection with a Compliance
Advisory previously issued by the CDPHE and subsequent inspections conducted by the
CDPHE. The Compliance Advisory alleged issues at five Company facilities regarding leakages
of volatile organic compounds from storage tanks, all of which were promptly addressed. We
understand that many other operators in the D-J basin are subject to similar investigations and
Compliance Advisories, and we have no reason to believe that we have greater potential liability
in this regard than other operators with similar numbers of facilities.  We are working with the
CDPHE to respond to any continuing concerns, but have not yet been informed of additional
facilities to be inspected or additional issues that have been identified. We cannot predict the
outcome of this matter.

Overview
Synergy Resources Corporation is a growth-oriented independent oil and natural gas company
engaged in the acquisition, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas in and
around the D-J Basin, which we believe to be one of the premier, liquids-rich oil and gas
resource plays in the United States. The D-J Basin generally extends from the Denver
metropolitan area throughout northeast Colorado into Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas. It
contains hydrocarbon-bearing deposits in several formations, including the Niobrara, Codell,
Greenhorn, Shannon, Sussex, J-Sand and D-Sand. The area has produced oil and gas for over
fifty years and benefits from established infrastructure including midstream and refining capacity,
long reserve life, and multiple service providers.
Our drilling and completion activities are focused in the Wattenberg Field, an area that covers the
western flank of the D-J Basin, predominantly in Weld County, Colorado. Currently, we are
focused on the horizontal development of the Codell and Niobrara formations, which are
characterized by relatively high liquids content. We operate the majority of the horizontal wells
we have working interests in, and we strive to maintain a high net revenue interest in all of our
operations.
Substantially all of our producing wells are either in or adjacent to the Wattenberg Field. We
operate approximately 66% of our proved producing reserves, and our planned fiscal 2016
drilling and completion expenditures are focused on the Wattenberg Field. This gives us both
operational focus and development flexibility to maximize returns on our leasehold position.

Market Conditions
Market prices for our products significantly impact our revenues, net income, and cash flow.  The
market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile.  To provide historical
perspective, the following table presents the average annual NYMEX prices for oil and natural
gas for each of the last five fiscal years.

Market conditions in the Wattenberg Field require us to sell oil at prices less than the prices
posted by the NYMEX. The negative differential between the prices actually received by us at the
wellhead and the published indices reflects deductions imposed upon us by the purchasers for
location and quality adjustments. We continue to negotiate with crude oil purchasers to obtain
better differentials on any barrels above our pipeline commitments. With regard to the sale of
natural gas and liquids, we have historically been able to sell production at prices greater than
the prices posted for dry gas, primarily because prices that we receive include payment for a
percentage of the value attributable to the natural gas liquids produced with the gas.
Price fluctuations can impact many aspects of our operations. For additional discussion
concerning the potential impacts from declining commodity prices, please see "Drilling and
Completion Operations," "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Oil and Gas Commodity Contracts,"
and "Trends and Outlook."

In addition to the producing wells summarized in the preceding table, as of June 30, 2016, we
were the operator of 20 gross (18 net) wells in progress, which excludes 8 gross (6 net) wells on
the Evans pad for which we have recently set surface casings.
Production
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our average daily production increased to 11,098
BOED as compared to 8,299 BOED for the three months ended June 30, 2015. During the first
six months of 2016, our average net daily production was 11,304 BOED. By comparison, during
the six months ended June 30, 2015, our average production rate was 7,668 BOED. As of
June 30, 2016, approximately 95% of our daily production was from horizontal wells.
Strategy
Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by increasing our net asset value, net
reserves and cash flow through development, exploitation, exploration, and acquisitions of oil
and gas properties. With current economic conditions, we intend to follow a balanced risk
strategy by allocating capital expenditures to lower risk development and exploitation activities.
Key elements of our business strategy include the following:
Concentrate on our existing core area in and around the D-J Basin, where we have significant
operating experience.  All of our current wells and our undeveloped acreage is located either in
or adjacent to the Wattenberg Field.  Focusing our operations in this area leverages our
management, technical and operational experience in the basin.
Develop and exploit existing oil and natural gas properties.  Since inception, our principal
growth strategy has been to develop and exploit our properties to add reserves.  In the
Wattenberg Field, we target three benches of the Niobrara formation as well as the Codell
formation for horizontal drilling and production. We believe horizontal drilling is the most efficient
way to recover the potential hydrocarbons and consider the Wattenberg Field to be relatively
low-risk because information gained from the large number of existing wells can be applied to
potential future wells.  There is enough similarity between wells in the Wattenberg Field that the
exploitation process is generally repeatable.
Improve hydrocarbon recovery through increased well density.  We utilize the best available
industry practices in our effort to determine the optimal recovery area for each well. When we
began our operated horizontal well development program in the Wattenberg Field, we assumed
spacing of 16 wells per 640 acre section. With increased experience and industry knowledge,
we are now testing up to 24 horizontal wells per section.
Complete selective acquisitions.  We seek to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas
properties, primarily in the core Wattenberg Field.  We generally seek acquisitions that will
provide us with opportunities for reserve additions and increased cash flow through production
enhancement and additional development and exploratory prospect generation.
Retain control over the operation of a substantial portion of our production. As operator of a
majority of our wells and undeveloped acreage, we control the timing and selection of new wells
to be drilled or existing wells to be re-completed.  This allows us to modify our capital spending
•
•
•
•
•
as our financial resources and underlying lease terms allow and market conditions permit.
27
•
Maintain financial flexibility while focusing on operational cost control.  We strive to be a cost-
efficient operator and to maintain a relatively low utilization of debt, which enhances our
financial flexibility. Our high degree of operational control, as well as our focus on operating
efficiencies and short return on investment cycle times, is central to our operating strategy.
•
Use the latest technology to maximize returns.  Our primary focus is drilling wells that have
7,000' to 10,000' of lateral as opposed to the 4,000' laterals that were initially drilled in the
Wattenberg Field. Increasing the number of wells drilled within a given drilling section, drilling
longer laterals, and applying technical advances in drilling and completion designs is leading to
enhanced productivity. Production results from various well designs are analyzed, and the
conclusions from each analysis are factored into future well designs that take into account
spacing between hydraulic fracturing stages, potential communication between wellbores,
lateral length, timing and economics.
Significant Developments
Acquisition and Divestiture Activity
On May 2, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 72,000
gross (33,100 net) acres located in an area known as the Greeley-Crescent project in Weld
County Colorado, primarily in and around the city of Greeley, for $505 million. The Company has
identified over 900 gross drilling locations on the acquired lands using an initial assumption of
horizontal development with 20-24 wells per drilling unit. Estimated net daily production from the
properties to be acquired was approximately 2,400 BOE at the time of entering into the GC
Agreement. The acquisition will have two separate closing dates. On June 14, 2016, the
Company closed on the portion of the assets comprised of the undeveloped lands and non-
operated production. The effective date of this part of the transaction was April 1, 2016, and the
purchase price was $487.3 million, comprised of $486.3 million in cash and the assumption of
certain liabilities. The second closing will cover the operated producing properties and is
expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017. For this part of the
transaction, the effective date will be April 1, 2016 for the horizontal wells to be acquired and the
first day of the calendar month in which the closing for such properties occurs for the vertical
wells. The second closing is subject to certain closing conditions, including the receipt of a
regulatory approval. Accordingly, the second closing of the transaction may not close in the
expected time frame or at all.
In April 2016, the Company agreed to divest approximately 3,700 net undeveloped acres and
107 vertical wells primarily in Adams County, Colorado for total consideration of approximately
$27.1 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We have received $23.5
million in cash and transferred liabilities of $0.5 million to the buyers. The buyer of the
undeveloped acreage has placed $3.1 million in cash in escrow pending the final resolution of its
due diligence procedures. The divested assets had associated production of approximately 200
BOED. The vertical well transaction closed in April 2016, and the undeveloped acreage
transaction closed in June 2016.
Financing and Other
Equity offerings
On January 27, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of 16,100,000 shares of common stock
pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, acting severally
on behalf of itself and the other underwriters.  The price to the Company was $5.545 per share
and net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of underwriting discounts and expenses
payable by the Company, were $89.2 million. Proceeds were used to repay amounts borrowed
under the Revolver and for general corporate purposes, which included continuing to develop
our acreage position in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and funding a portion of our 2016
capital expenditure program.
On April 14, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 22,425,000 shares of
common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement with the same underwriters.  The price to
the Company was $7.3535 per share and net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of
underwriting discounts and expenses payable by the Company, were $164.8 million.  The
proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the GC
Acquisition.
In May and June 2016, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 51,750,000 shares of
common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement with the same underwriters.  The price to
the Company was $5.597 per share and net proceeds to the Company, after deduction of
underwriting discounts and expenses payable by the Company, were $289.4 million. The
proceeds of this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to fund the GC
Acquisition.
28
Revolving Credit Facility
We continue to maintain a borrowing arrangement with our bank syndicate to provide us with
liquidity, which could be used to develop oil and gas properties, acquire new oil and gas
properties, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2016,
this revolving credit facility (sometimes referred to as the "Revolver") provides for maximum
borrowings of $500 million, subject to adjustments based upon a borrowing base calculation,
which is re-determined semi-annually using updated reserve reports. The Revolver is
collateralized by certain of our assets, including producing properties, and bears a variable
interest rate on borrowings, with the effective rate varying with utilization. The Revolver expires
on December 15, 2019.
On January 28, 2016, the Revolver was amended in connection with the semi-annual borrowing
base redetermination. The borrowing base was reduced from $163 million to $145 million, and
the Revolver was further amended to (i) delete the minimum interest rate floor, (ii) delete the
minimum liquidity covenant, (iii) add a current ratio covenant of 1.0 to 1.0, and (iv) delete the
minimum hedging requirement. As of June 30, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings
under the Revolver, and the entire $145 million borrowing base was available to us for future
borrowings. See further discussion in Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.
On May 3, 2016, the Revolver was further amended to, among other things, permit the issuance
of senior unsecured notes, subject to certain conditions. Pursuant to the amendment, if the
aggregate amount of senior unsecured notes issued from time to time exceeds $100 million, then
the borrowing base will automatically be reduced by an amount equal to 25% of the stated
principal amount of the senior unsecured notes in excess of $100 million.
Senior Notes
On June 14, 2016, the Company issued $80 million aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior
Unsecured Notes ("Senior Notes") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The
maturity for the payment of principal is June 13, 2021. Interest on the Notes accrues at 9.00% and
began accruing on June 14, 2016. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
beginning on December 15, 2016. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated
as of June 14, 2016 (the "Indenture") and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the
Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that incur or guarantee certain indebtedness,
including indebtedness under the revolving credit facility. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Senior Notes were $75.8 million after deductions of $4.2 million for expenses and underwriting
discounts and commissions. The net proceeds were used to fund the GC Acquisition. The
Indenture contains covenants that restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of certain of its
subsidiaries to, among other restrictions and limitations: (i) incur additional indebtedness;
(ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its or
their assets; (v) engage in transactions with affiliates; or (vi) engage in certain restricted business
activities.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications.
Impairment of full cost pool
Every quarter, we perform a ceiling test as prescribed by SEC regulations for entities following
the full cost method of accounting. This test determines a limit on the book value of oil and gas
properties using a formula to estimate future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves. This
formula is dependent on several factors and assumes future oil and natural gas prices to be
equal to an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and natural gas prices derived from each of the
12 months prior to the reporting period. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, these
calculations indicated that the ceiling amount had declined, largely as a result of the decline in oil
and natural gas prices, such that the ceiling was less than the net book value of oil and gas
properties. As a result, we recorded ceiling test impairments totaling $189.8 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016. This full cost ceiling impairment is recognized as a charge to
earnings and may not be reversed in future periods, even if oil and natural gas prices
subsequently increase. Declining commodity prices, other adverse market conditions,
acquisitions, or divestitures could result in further ceiling test write-downs in the future.
Drilling and Completion Operations
Our drilling and completion schedule has a material impact on our production forecast and a
corresponding impact on our expected future cash flows. As commodity prices have fallen, we
have been able to reduce per-well drilling and completion costs. We believe that at current
drilling and completion cost levels and with currently prevailing commodity prices, we can
achieve reasonable well-level rates of return when drilling mid-length or long laterals. Should
commodity prices weaken further our operational flexibility will allow us to adjust our drilling and
completion schedule, if prudent. If management believes the well-level internal rate of return will
be at or below our weighted-average cost of capital, we may choose to delay completions and/or
forego drilling altogether.
29
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we completed the drilling of 10 horizontal wells on
the Vista pad and 11 of 14 horizontal wells on the Fagerberg pad with the drilling of the
remaining 3 horizontal wells being completed shortly after quarter end. Upon completion of the
Fagerberg pad, the rig will be moved to the Evans pad, where we have begun to set the surface
casings. As of June 30, 2016, there are 20 gross horizontal wells in various stages of completion,
which excludes 8 gross horizontal wells on the Evans pad for which we have recently set surface
casings. For 2016 as a whole, we expect to drill 55 gross (52 net) horizontal wells of mostly mid-
length and long laterals targeting the Codell and Niobrara zones.
Other Operations
We continue to be opportunistic with respect to acquisition efforts. In an effort to extend the length
of laterals in our wells, we continue to enter into land and working interest swaps to increase our
overall leasehold interest.
Trends and Outlook
Oil traded at $37.13 per Bbl on December 31, 2015, but increased approximately 30% through
June 30, 2016 to $48.27. Natural gas traded at $2.34 per Mcf on December 31, 2015, but
increased approximately 25% through June 30, 2016 to $2.92. Although prices have risen in the
last three months, prices continue to remain significantly lower than their 2014 levels, which were
near $100/bbl, and early 2015 levels, which were near $55/bbl. These lower oil and gas prices (i)
will reduce our cash flow which, in turn, will reduce the funds available for exploring and
replacing oil and gas reserves, (ii) will potentially reduce our current Revolver borrowing base
capacity and increase the difficulty of obtaining equity and debt financing and worsen the terms
on which such financing may be obtained, (iii) will reduce the number of oil and gas prospects
which have reasonable economic returns, (iv) may cause us to allow leases to expire based
upon the value of potential oil and gas reserves in relation to the costs of exploration, (v) may
result in marginally productive oil and gas wells being abandoned as non-commercial, and (vi)
may cause a ceiling test impairment. However, price declines reduce the competition for oil and
gas properties and correspondingly reduce the prices paid for leases and prospects.
Other factors that will most significantly affect our results of operations include (i) activities on
properties that we operate, (ii) the marketability of our production, (iii) our ability to satisfy our
financial and transportation obligations, (iv) completion of acquisitions of additional properties
and reserves, and (v) competition from larger companies. Our revenues will also be significantly
impacted by our ability to maintain or increase oil or gas production through exploration and
development activities.
Horizontal well development in the Wattenberg Field is enabling operators to utilize higher
density drilling within designated spacing units. When we began our operated horizontal well
development program in the Wattenberg Field, we allowed for up to 16 wells per 640 acre
section, but we are now testing up to 24 horizontal wells per section.
The decline in commodity prices during 2015 and early 2016 has led to a corresponding decline
in service costs, which directly relate to our drilling and completion costs. We have been able to
reduce drilling and completion costs during the first half of 2016 due to a combination of
optimizing well designs, moving to day-rate drilling, lower contract rates for drilling rigs, fewer
average days to drill, and lower completion costs. This focus on cost reduction has supported
well-level economics in spite of the severe drop in the prices of crude oil and natural gas. We
continue to strive to reduce drilling and completion costs going forward to offset the negative
impacts associated with lower commodity prices, but we do not believe that we will achieve the
same percentage reduction of costs during the remainder of 2016, and well-level rates of return
may be lower, particularly if commodity prices continue to decline.
From time to time, our production has been adversely impacted by high natural gas gathering line
pressures, especially in the northern area of the Wattenberg Field. Where it is cost effective, we
install wellhead compression to enhance our ability to inject gas into the gathering system and, in
some instances, install larger gathering lines to help mitigate the impacts. Additionally,
midstream companies that operate the gas gathering pipelines in the area continue to make
significant capital investments to increase their capacities. While these actions have helped
reduce overall line pressures in the field, several of our producing locations have been shut-in on
occasion due to line pressures exceeding system limits.
We have begun the use of oil gathering lines to certain production locations. We anticipate that
these gathering systems would be owned and operated by independent third party companies,
but that we would commit specific wellhead production to these systems. We believe that oil
gathering lines would have several benefits including, a) reduced need to use trucks to gather
our oil, thereby reducing truck traffic in and around our production locations, b) potentially lower
gathering costs as pipeline gathering tends to be more efficient, c) less on-site oil storage
capacity, resulting in lower production location facility costs, and d) generally less noise and
dust.
30
Oil transportation and takeaway capacity has recently increased with the expansion of certain
interstate pipelines servicing the Wattenberg Field. This has reversed the prior imbalance of oil
production exceeding the combination of local refinery demand and the capacity of pipelines to
move the oil to other markets. Depending on transportation commitments, local refinery demand,
and our production volumes, we may be able to reduce the negative differential that we have
historically realized on our oil production. We anticipate that there will continue to be excess
pipeline takeaway capacity as additional pipelines are expected to begin operations in the
second half of calendar 2016. Further details regarding posted prices and average realized
prices are discussed in the section entitled "Market Conditions," presented in this Item 2.
We believe that the GC Acquisition will allow us to achieve significant efficiencies through the
establishment of a contiguous acreage position in an attractive area in the Wattenberg Field,
which should facilitate the drilling of longer lateral wells and high-grading of our drilling inventory.
As discussed in the "Risk Factors" section of this report, certain groups opposed to oil and
natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, are attempting to seek
the required number of signatures to have two initiatives placed on the November 2016 ballot.
One of the initiatives would impose a minimum distance of 2,500 feet between wells and any
occupied structures or other sensitive areas. The second would give local governmental
authorities the ability to regulate, or to ban, oil and gas exploration, development and production
activities within their boundaries notwithstanding state rules and approvals to the contrary. Either
initiative, if implemented, could have severely adverse effects on our operations, reserves and
financial condition.
Other than the foregoing, we do not know of any trends, events, or uncertainties that will have
had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our sales, revenues, expenses,
liquidity, or capital resources.
Results of Operations
Material changes of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations included in our
consolidated financial statements for the periods presented are discussed below.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we reported a net loss of $153.8 million compared to
net loss of $4.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss per basic and
diluted share (including the ceiling test impairment of $144.1 million) was $(0.89) for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.04) for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss per basic share for the three months ended June 30,
2016 increased by $0.85 primarily due to the ceiling test impairment of $144.1 million incurred
during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Revenues decreased 15% during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to the
rapid decline of commodity prices, as discussed previously. As of June 30, 2016, we had 620
gross producing wells, compared with 563 gross producing wells as of June 30, 2015. The
impact of changing prices on our commodity derivative positions and a full cost ceiling
impairment also drove significant differences in our results of operations between the two
periods.

Oil and Gas Production and Revenues - For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded
total oil and gas revenues of $23.9 million compared to $28.3 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015, a decrease of $4.3 million or 15%. The following table summarizes key

Net oil and gas production for the three months ended June 30, 2016 averaged 11,098 BOED, an
increase of 34% over average production of 8,299 BOED in the three months ended June 30,
2015. From June 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016, we added 48 net horizontal wells, including 6 (net)
horizontal wells acquired in the KPK Acquisition, increasing our reserves, producing wells, and
daily production totals. However, the 37% decline in average sales prices more than offset the
effects of increased production, resulting in an overall reduction of revenues.

Lease operating and workover costs tend to increase or decrease primarily in relation to the
number of wells in production, and, to a lesser extent, to fluctuations in oil field service costs and
changes in the production mix of crude oil and natural gas. The
32
$3.1 million increase in lease operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase
in environmental remediation and regulatory compliance projects. The related costs per BOE
increased by $1.81 primarily as a result of increased remediation work during the three months
ended June 30, 2016.
Production taxes - During the three months ended June 30, 2016, production taxes were $2.1
million, or $2.12 per BOE, compared to $2.6 million, or $3.42 per BOE, during the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Taxes tend to increase or decrease primarily based on the value of oil and
gas sold. As a percentage of revenues, production taxes were 8.9% and 9.1% for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016, depletion of oil and gas properties was $11.16 per
BOE compared to $20.84 per BOE for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in
the DD&A rate was the result of a decrease in the ratio of total costs capitalized in the full cost
pool to the estimated recoverable reserves. This ratio was significantly reduced due to the
impairments of our full cost pool, which primarily occurred during the second half of calendar
2015 and the first quarter of 2016, and the increase in our total proved reserves. Capitalized
costs of proved oil and gas properties are depleted quarterly using the units-of-production
method based on estimated reserves, wherein the ratio of production volumes for the quarter to
beginning of quarter estimated total reserves determine the depletion rate.
Full cost ceiling impairment - During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a
total impairment of $144.1 million as compared to an impairment of $3.0 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015, representing the amount by which the net capitalized costs of our
oil and gas properties exceeded our full cost ceiling. See Note 2, "Property and Equipment," to
the consolidated financial statements included as part of this report.

G&A includes all overhead costs associated with employee compensation and benefits,
insurance, facilities, professional fees, and regulatory costs, among others. During the three
months ended June 30, 2016, we increased our employee count, which was 62 as of December
31, 2015 to 73, while reducing the number of consultants, advisors, and contractors that had
historically been used for certain tasks.
33
Our G&A expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 includes stock-based
compensation of $2.4 million compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Stock-based compensation includes a calculated value for stock options or shares of common
stock that we grant for compensatory purposes. It is a non-cash charge. For stock options, the fair
value is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. For restricted stock
units and stock bonus shares, the fair value is estimated using the closing stock price on the
grant date. Amounts are pro-rated over the vesting terms of the award agreements, which are
generally three to five years.
Pursuant to the requirements under the full cost accounting method for oil and gas properties, we
identify all general and administrative costs that relate directly to the acquisition of undeveloped
mineral leases and the exploration and development of properties. Those costs are reclassified
from G&A expenses and capitalized into the full cost pool. The increase in capitalized costs from
the three months ended June 30, 2015 to the three months ended June 30, 2016 reflects our
increased headcount of individuals performing activities to maintain and acquire leases and
develop our properties.
Commodity derivative losses - As more fully described in Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 8,
Commodity Derivative Instruments, we use commodity contracts to help mitigate the risks
inherent in the price volatility of oil and natural gas. For the three months ended June 30, 2016,
we realized a cash settlement gain of $0.4 million, net of previously incurred premiums
attributable to the settled commodity contracts. For the prior comparable period, we realized a
cash settlement gain of $3.8 million.
In addition, for the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an unrealized loss of $6.1
million to recognize the mark-to-market change in fair value of our commodity contracts. In
comparison, in the three months ended June 30, 2015, we reported an unrealized loss of $8.2
million. Unrealized losses are non-cash items.
Income taxes - We reported income tax expense of $0.1 million for the three months ended June
30, 2016, calculated at an effective tax rate of 0%. During the comparable prior year period, we
reported income tax benefit of $2.9 million, calculated at an effective tax rate of 39%. As
explained in more detail below, during the period ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was
substantially reduced by recognition of a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate differed from the statutory
rate, primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax
assets.
For tax purposes, we have a net operating loss ("NOL") carryover of $44.2 million, which is
available to offset future taxable income. The NOLs will begin to expire, if not used, in 2031. As a
result of the NOLs and other tax strategies, it appears that payment of any tax liability will be
substantially deferred into future years.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Based on the
level of losses in the current period and the level of uncertainty with respect to future taxable
income over the period in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, a valuation
allowance has been provided as of June 30, 2016. During the 2015 comparable period, we
reached the opposite conclusion; therefore, we did not record a valuation allowance against any
of our deferred tax assets in that period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reported net loss of $205.2 million compared to net
loss of $5.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss per basic and diluted
share (including a ceiling test impairment of $189.8 million) was $(1.40) for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to net loss per basic and diluted share of $(0.06) for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. Net loss per basic share for the six months ended June 30, 2016
increased by $1.34 primarily due to the ceiling test impairment of $189.8 million incurred during
the three months ended June 30, 2016. Revenues decreased 11% during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared with the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to the rapid decline of
commodity prices, as discussed previously. As of June 30, 2016, we had 620 gross producing
wells, compared with 563 gross producing wells as of June 30, 2015. The impact of changing
prices on our commodity derivative positions and a full cost ceiling impairment also drove
significant differences in our results of operations between the two periods.

Oil and Gas Production and Revenues - For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded
total oil and gas revenues of $42.2 million compared to $47.2 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015, a decrease of $5.0 million or 11%. The following table summarizes key

Net oil and gas production for the six months ended June 30, 2016 averaged 11,304 BOED, an
increase of 47% over average production of 7,668 BOED in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
From June 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016, we added 48 net horizontal wells, including 6 (net)
horizontal wells acquired in the KPK Acquisition, increasing our reserves, producing wells, and
daily production totals. However, the 40% decline in average sales prices more than offset the
effects of increased production, resulting in an overall reduction of revenues.

Lease operating and workover costs tend to increase or decrease primarily in relation to the
number of wells in production, and, to a lesser extent, on fluctuation in oil field service costs and
changes in the production mix of crude oil and natural gas. The $3.3 million increase in lease
operating expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in environmental remediation
and regulatory compliance projects. The related costs per BOE decreased by $0.24 primarily as
a result of increased production during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Production taxes - During the six months ended June 30, 2016, production taxes were $4.0
million, or $1.93 per BOE,
35
compared to $4.4 million, or $3.16 per BOE, during the six months ended June 30, 2015. Taxes
tend to increase or decrease primarily based on the value of oil and gas sold. As a percentage of
revenues, production taxes were 9.4% and 9.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, depletion of oil and gas properties was $11.36 per BOE
compared to $21.48 per BOE for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the
DD&A rate was the result of a decrease in the ratio of total costs capitalized in the full cost pool to
the estimated recoverable reserves. This ratio was significantly reduced due to the impairments
of our full cost pool, which primarily occurred during the second half of calendar 2015, and the
increase in our total proved reserves. Capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are
depleted quarterly using the units-of-production method based on estimated reserves, wherein
the ratio of production volumes for the quarter to beginning of quarter estimated total reserves

Full cost ceiling impairment - During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a total
impairment of $189.8 million as compared to an impairment of $3.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015, representing the amount by which the net capitalized costs of our oil and
gas properties exceeded our full cost ceiling. See Note 2, "Property and Equipment," to the

G&A includes all overhead costs associated with employee compensation and benefits,

ended June 30, 2016, we increased our employee count from 62 as of December 31, 2015 to 73,
while reducing the number of consultants, advisors, and contractors that had historically been
used for certain tasks.
Our G&A expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 includes stock-based compensation
of $4.9 million compared to $5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Pursuant to the requirements under the full cost accounting method for oil and gas properties, we
identify all general and administrative costs that relate directly to the acquisition of undeveloped
mineral leases and the exploration and development of
36
properties. Those costs are reclassified from G&A expenses and capitalized into the full cost
pool. The increase in capitalized costs from the six months ended June 30, 2015 to the six
months ended June 30, 2016 reflects our increased headcount of individuals performing
activities to maintain and acquire leases and develop our properties.
Commodity derivative losses - As more fully described in Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 8,
Commodity Derivative Instruments, we use commodity contracts to help mitigate the risks
inherent in the price volatility of oil and natural gas. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
realized a cash settlement gain of $2.9 million, net of previously incurred premiums attributable to
the settled commodity contracts. For the prior comparable period, we realized a cash settlement
gain of $17.3 million.
In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an unrealized loss of $6.9
million to recognize the mark-to-market change in fair value of our commodity contracts. In
comparison, in the six months ended June 30, 2015, we reported an unrealized loss of $18.2
million. Unrealized losses are non-cash items.
Income taxes - We reported income tax expense of $0.1 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016, calculated at an effective tax rate of 0%. During the comparable prior year period, we
reported income tax benefit of $3.6 million, calculated at an effective tax rate of 39%. During the
period ended June 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was substantially reduced by recognition of a
full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets. During the six months ended June 30,
2016, the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate, primarily due to the recognition of
a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by the sale of equity and
debt securities, cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of properties, and borrowings
under bank credit facilities.  Our primary use of capital has been for the exploration, development,
and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties.  Our future success in growing proved reserves
and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available to us.
We believe that our capital resources, including cash on hand, amounts available under our
revolving credit facility, and cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our
planned capital expenditures and operating expenses for the next twelve months. We funded the
purchase price of the GC Acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds of
financing transactions, including the issuance of the Senior Notes. We do not expect to
commence drilling activities on the properties acquired in the GC Acquisition until 2017. To the
extent actual operating results differ from our anticipated results, available borrowings under our
credit facility are reduced, or we experience other unfavorable events, our liquidity could be
adversely impacted.  Our liquidity would also be affected if we increase our capital expenditures
or complete one or more additional acquisitions. Terms of future financings may be unfavorable,
and we cannot assure investors that funding will be available on acceptable terms.
As operator of the majority of our wells and undeveloped acreage, we control the timing and
selection of new wells to be drilled or existing wells to be recompleted. This allows us to modify
our capital spending as our financial resources allow and market conditions support.
Additionally, our relatively low utilization of debt enhances our financial flexibility as it provides a
potential source of future liquidity while currently not overly burdening us with restrictive financial
covenants and mandatory repayment schedules.
Sources and Uses
Our sources and uses of capital are heavily influenced by the prices that we receive for our
production. During the first half of 2016, the NYMEX-WTI oil price ranged from a high of $51.23
per Bbl on Wednesday, June 8, 2016 to a low of $26.19 per Bbl on Thursday, February 11, 2016,
while the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a low of $1.64 per MMBtu on
Thursday, March 3, 2016 to a high of $2.92 per MMBtu on June 30, 2016. These markets will
likely continue to be volatile in the future. To deal with the volatility in commodity prices, we
maintain a flexible capital investment program and seek to maintain a high operating interest in
our leaseholds with limited long-term capital commitments. This enables us to accelerate or
decelerate our activities quickly in response to changing industry environments.
37
At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $78.6 million and no outstanding
balance under our revolving credit facility. Our sources and (uses) of funds for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below (in thousands):

Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.2 million and $60.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in cash from operating activities
reflects the decline in commodity prices, which was partially offset by the increase in production.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received cash proceeds from, and used cash
proceeds in, the following financing activities:
On January 27, 2016, we received cash proceeds of approximately $89.2 million (after
underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses) from our public offering of 16,100,000
shares (including the shares sold pursuant to an over-allotment option exercised by the
underwriters) at a price to us of $5.545 per share. Proceeds were used to repay amounts
borrowed under the Revolver and for general corporate purposes, which included continuing to
develop our acreage position in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and funding a portion of our
2016 capital expenditure program.
In January 2016, the Company repaid its outstanding borrowings under the Revolver of $78
million. In addition, on June 13, 2016, the Company borrowed approximately $55 million under
the Revolver in order to pay a portion of the purchase price for the GC Acquisition pending
receipt of proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes.  The full amount borrowed was
repaid on June 14, 2016.
On April 14, 2016, we received cash proceeds of approximately $164.8 million (after
underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses) from our public offering of 22,425,000
shares (including the shares sold pursuant to an over-allotment option exercised by the
underwriters) at a price to us of $7.3535 per share. These proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes, including to fund the GC Acquisition.

In May and June 2016, we received cash proceeds of approximately $289.4 million (after
underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses) from our public offering of 51,750,000
shares (including the shares sold pursuant to an over-allotment option exercised by the
underwriters) at a price to us of $5.597 per share. These proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes, including to fund the GC Acquisition.
On June 14, 2016, the Company issued $80 million aggregate principal amount of 9.00% Senior
Unsecured Notes ("Senior Notes") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. See "-
Senior Notes" below. The net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were $75.8 million
after deductions of $4.2 million for expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions. The
net proceeds were used to fund the GC Acquisition.
Credit Facility
We maintain a borrowing arrangement with a banking syndicate.  The arrangement, in the form of
a revolving credit facility, was most recently amended with the Eighth Amendment to the credit
facility on May 3, 2016.  The arrangement provides for a maximum loan commitment of $500
million; however, the maximum amount we can borrow at any one time is subject to a borrowing
base limitation, which stipulates that we may borrow up to the lesser of the maximum loan
commitment or the borrowing base.  The borrowing base can increase or decrease based upon
the value of the collateral, which secures any amounts borrowed under the line of credit.  The
value of the collateral will generally be derived with reference to the estimated future net cash
flows from our proved oil and gas reserves, discounted by 10%. Amounts borrowed under the
facility are secured by substantially all of our producing wells and developed oil and gas leases.
As of December 31, 2015, our borrowing base was $163 million, and we had $78 million
outstanding under the facility, which was fully repaid during the three months ended March 31,
2016. The maturity date of the facility is December 15, 2019. On January 28, 2016, the borrowing
base was reduced from $163 million to $145 million. As of June 30, 2016, the total of the

$145 million was available to us for future borrowings. The next semi-annual redetermination has
been scheduled for November 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, interest on our revolving line of credit accrues at a variable rate. The interest
rate pricing grid contains a graduated escalation in applicable margin for increased utilization.
On January 28, 2016, the Revolver was amended to (i) delete the minimum interest rate floor, (ii)
delete the minimum liquidity covenant, (iii) add a current ratio covenant of 1.0 to 1.0, and (iv)
delete the minimum hedging requirement.
The Revolver requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial and liquidity
ratio covenants. Under the requirements, the Company, on a quarterly basis, must not (a) at any
time permit its ratio of total funded debt as of such time to EBITDAX, as defined in the agreement,
to be greater than or equal to 4.0 to 1.0; or (b) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter permit its
current ratio, as defined in the agreement, to be less than 1.0 to 1.0.
Senior Notes
On June 14, 2016, the Company issued $80 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The maturity for the payment of
principal is June 13, 2021. Interest on the Notes accrues at 9.00% and began accruing on June
14, 2016. Interest is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December
15, 2016. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 14, 2016 (the
"Indenture") and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company’s existing and
future subsidiaries that incur or guarantee certain indebtedness, including indebtedness under
the revolving credit facility. At any time prior to December 14, 2018, the Company may redeem all
or a part of the Senior Notes subject to the Make-Whole Price (as defined in the Indenture) and
accrued and unpaid interest.  On and after December 14, 2018, the Company may redeem all or
a part of the Senior Notes at the redemption price at a specified percentage of the principal
amount of the redeemed notes (104.50% for 2018, 102.25% for 2019, and 100.0% for 2020 and
thereafter, during the twelve-month period beginning on December 14 of each applicable year),
plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, prior to December 14, 2018, the Company can, on
one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes with all or
a portion of the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (as defined in the Indenture) at
a redemption price equal to 109.00% of the principal amount of the redeemed notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, subject to certain conditions.
The Indenture contains covenants that restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of certain of
its subsidiaries to, among other restrictions and limitations: (i) incur additional indebtedness;
(ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends; (iv) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its or
their assets; (v) engage in transactions with affiliates; or (vi) engage in certain restricted business
activities.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications.
Reconciliation of Cash Payments to Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows are calculated on a
strict cash basis, which differs from the accrual basis used to calculate other amounts reported in
our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, cash payments for acquisition of property and
equipment as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows excludes non-cash capital
expenditures and includes an adjustment (plus or minus) to reflect the timing of when the capital
expenditure obligations are incurred and when the actual cash payment is made.  On an accrual
basis, capital expenditures totaled $537.5 million and $94.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A reconciliation of the differences between cash payments
and the accrual basis amounts is summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Capital Expenditures
The majority of capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were associated
with the acquisition of certain acreage and the costs of drilling and completing wells.  During the
six months ended June 30, 2016, we completed the 10 horizontal wells on the Vista pad, began
the drilling of 12 horizontal wells on the Fagerberg pad, and set surface casings on 8 horizontal
wells on the Evans pad. The Fagerberg pad will have a total of 14 horizontal wells, and the
Evans pad will have a total of 22 horizontal wells. In total, we had drilled 20 gross (18 net) wells
that had not been brought into productive status as of June 30, 2016, which excludes 8 gross (6
net) wells on the Evans pad for which we have recently set surface casings. All but eight of the
wells in progress are scheduled to commence production before December 31, 2016.
With respect to our ownership interest in wells operated by other companies, we participated in
drilling and completion activities on 1 gross (0.24 net) wells during the second quarter.
Capital Requirements
Our level of exploration, development, and acreage expenditures is largely discretionary, and the
amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly
depending on available opportunities, commodity prices, cash flows, and development results,
among other factors. Our primary need for capital will be to fund our anticipated drilling and
completion activities, the second closing on the GC Acquisition, and any other acquisitions that
we may complete during the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2016.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we operated one drilling rig for the execution of our
capital expenditure plan. Consistent with our plan, we added a second rig in July 2016 to drill the
adjoining Evans East and Evans West pads in order to minimize the impact on the local
municipality. We also regularly review capital expenditures throughout the year, as has been our
historical practice, and will adjust our program based on changes in commodity prices, service
costs, drilling success, and capital availability. Our total anticipated capital program for the year
ended December 31, 2016 is estimated at a range between $130 million and $150 million,
including approximately $30 million for discretionary seismic and land leasing, but excluding the
GC Acquisition and any other potential acquisitions that we may execute. Capital expenditures
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately $37 million.
For the near term, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our needs through cash on
hand, cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings available under our revolving credit
facility.  However, to meet all of our long-term goals, we may need to raise additional funds to drill
new wells through the sale of our securities, from third parties willing to pay our share of drilling
and completing wells, or from other sources.  We may not be successful in raising the capital
needed to drill or acquire oil or gas wells.
Oil and Gas Commodity Contracts
We use derivative contracts to protect against the variability in cash flows created by short-term
price fluctuations associated with the sale of future oil and gas production.  At June 30, 2016, we
had open positions covering 1.2 million barrels of oil and 3,960 MMcf of natural gas. We do not
use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we entered
into additional positions covering 1,200 MMcf of natural gas.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reported an unrealized commodity activity loss
of $6.9 million.  Unrealized gains and losses are non-cash items.  We also reported a realized
gain of $2.9 million, representing the cash settlement of commodity contracts settled during the
period, net of previously incurred premiums attributable to the settled commodity contracts.
At June 30, 2016, we estimated that the fair value of our various commodity derivative contracts
was a net asset of $1.6 million. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 9, Fair Value
Measurements, for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity
derivative instruments.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"), we present certain financial measures
which are not prescribed by US GAAP ("non-GAAP"). In the future, we may disclose different
non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and
compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations. We
strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed
reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. A summary of the non-
GAAP measure that we currently use is described below.
40
Adjusted EBITDA
We use "adjusted EBITDA," a non-GAAP financial measure, for internal managerial purposes
because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the
results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital
structure. We exclude the items listed in the table below from net loss in arriving at adjusted
EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our
industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and
the method by which the assets were acquired. This measure is not a measure of financial
performance under US GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for,
cash flows from operations, investing, or financing activities, and it should not be viewed as a
liquidity measure or indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with US GAAP. Our definition
of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to measures with similar titles reported by other
companies. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a widely used in our industry as a measure of
operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet debt
covenant requirements. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude the impact
of the items set forth in the table below.
The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial
measure, to net loss, its nearest GAAP measure:

Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity
with US GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future
events that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes. We identify certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other
things, their impact on the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity
and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting
policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of
such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and
disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies.
There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates or in the
underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used from those disclosed in the
"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
section of the Transition Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 22, 2016 and in the
financial statements and accompanying notes contained in that report. However, certain events
during the first quarter increased the significance of our policies with respect to the evaluation of
goodwill. This item is discussed in Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 1, Organization and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Note 1 also provides information regarding
recently issued accounting pronouncements.
We call your attention to the increased significance of the ceiling test as disclosed in Item 1.
Financial Statements – Note 2, Property and Equipment, to the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
41
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an impairment in conjunction with
performing a ceiling test as prescribed by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-05.
42
ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKS
Commodity Price Risk - Our financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources are
highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas. The volatility of oil
prices affects our results to a greater degree than the volatility of gas prices, as approximately
74% and 72% of our revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively,
was from the sale of oil. A $10 per barrel change in our realized oil price would have resulted in a
$5.1 million and $10.4 million change in revenues during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, while a $0.50 per Mcf change in our realized gas price would have
resulted in a $1.5 million and $3.1 million change in our natural gas revenues for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the price of oil and natural gas increased slightly. 
These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a
variety of factors that are beyond our control. Factors influencing oil and natural gas prices
include the levels of demand and supply for oil (in global or local markets), the establishment of
and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries, weather conditions which
determine the demand for natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the strength
of the US dollar compared to other currencies, and overall economic conditions. It is impossible
to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty. Sustained weakness in oil
and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and
may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically.
Any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations,
can have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development
activities. Similarly, any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact
on our financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources.
We attempt to mitigate fluctuations in short-term cash flow resulting from changes in commodity
prices by entering into derivative positions on a portion of our expected oil and gas production. 
We use derivative contracts to cover up to 85% of expected proved developed producing
production as projected in our semi-annual reserve report, generally over a period of two years. 
We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes.  As of June 30,
2016, we had open crude oil derivatives in a net asset position with a fair value of $1.6 million.  A
hypothetical upward shift of 10% in the NYMEX forward curve of crude oil and natural gas prices
would decrease the fair value of our position by approximately $0.8 million. A hypothetical
downward shift of 10% in the NYMEX forward curve of crude oil and natural gas prices would
increase the fair value of our position by approximately $1.4 million. A summary of our open
positions as of June 30, 2016 is set forth in Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 8, Commodity
Derivative Instruments.
Interest Rate Risk - At June 30, 2016, we had no debt outstanding under our bank credit facility. 
Interest on our credit facility accrues at a variable rate, based upon either the Prime Rate or the
London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin.  We are exposed to interest
rate risk on the bank credit facility if the variable reference rates increase. If interest rates
increase, our monthly interest payments would increase, and our available cash flow would
decrease.  We estimate that if market interest rates increased or decreased by 1%, our interest
payments in the three months ended June 30, 2016 would have changed by less than $0.1
million.
Counterparty Risk - As described in "- Commodity Price Risk" above, we enter into commodity
derivative agreements to mitigate short-term price volatility.  These derivative financial
instruments present certain counterparty risks.  We are exposed to potential loss if a counterparty
fails to perform according to the terms of the agreement. The failure of any of the counterparties to
fulfill their obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.  We
do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by counterparties.  We seek to manage
the counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to well capitalized,
well established, and well known counterparties that have been approved by our senior officers. 
There can be no assurance, however, that our practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk.
Our exposure to counterparty risk has slightly declined during the last period as the amounts due
to us from counterparties has decreased.
43
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report on
Form 10-Q (the "Evaluation Date").  Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recently completed fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
44
PART II
Item 1.Legal Proceedings
Except as disclosed in Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during
the quarter, there were no material developments regarding legal matters, which were previously
described under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of the Transition Report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 22, 2016. This information should be considered
carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with
the SEC.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, operating results or liquidity, and the trading price of our common stock are described
under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the Transition Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on April 22, 2016. This information should be considered carefully,
together with other information in this report and other reports and materials that we file with the
SEC. In addition, you should consider the following risks:
Risks Related to the GC Acquisition
The GC Acquisition may not achieve its intended results and may result in us assuming
unanticipated liabilities. These risks are heightened because the GC Acquisition involved our
acquisition of a material amount of acreage relative to our prior acreage position.
We entered into the purchase and sale agreement related to the GC Acquisition (the "GC
Agreement") with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits, growth
opportunities and synergies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a
number of risks and uncertainties. For example, we may discover title defects or adverse
environmental or other conditions related to the acquired properties of which we are currently
unaware. Environmental, title and other problems could reduce the value of the properties to us,
and, depending on the circumstances, we could have limited or no recourse to the sellers with
respect to those problems. We assumed substantially all of the liabilities associated with the
acquired properties and would be entitled to indemnification in connection with those liabilities in
only limited circumstances and in limited amounts. We cannot assure that such potential
remedies will be adequate for any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant. In
addition, if the second closing under the GC Agreement is delayed for a substantial period, we
will not be able to control operations on those properties during that period, which would
increase the risk that certain leases will expire before production is established, and this could
materially detract from the value of the properties acquired pursuant to either closing. The second
closing is subject to certain closing conditions, including our receipt of a release of a consent
decree burdening certain of the properties to be acquired, and these conditions may not be
satisfied in the time frame we expect or at all. Completing the integration process may be more
expensive than anticipated, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect the
integration of these operations smoothly or efficiently or that the anticipated benefits of the
transaction will be achieved.
The risks involved in the GC Acquisition are heightened due to the size of the acquisition. The
GC Acquisition involved a material amount of acreage relative to our prior acreage position.
Actual reserves and production associated with the properties to be acquired in the GC
Acquisition may be substantially less than we expect.
As with other acquisitions, the success of the GC Acquisition depends on, among other things,
the accuracy of our assessment of the number and quality of the drilling locations associated with
the properties to be acquired, future oil and natural gas prices, reserves and production, and
future operating costs and various other factors. These assessments are necessarily inexact. Our
assessment of certain of these factors is based in part on information provided to us by the
sellers, including historical production data. Our independent reserve engineers have not
provided a report regarding the estimates of reserves with respect to the properties subject to the
GC Acquisition. The assumptions on which our internal estimates have been based may prove to
be incorrect in a number of material ways, resulting in our not realizing the expected benefits of
the acquisition. In addition, the representations, warranties and indemnities of the sellers
contained in the GC Agreement are limited, and we may not have recourse against the sellers in
the event that the acreage is less valuable than we currently believe. As a result, we may not
recover the purchase price for the acquisition from the sale of production from the properties
being acquired or recognize an acceptable return from such sales.
45
The development of the properties to be acquired will be subject to all of the risks and
uncertainties associated with oil and natural gas activities as described in the "Risk Factors"
section of our Transition Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.
A significant portion of the value of the GC Acquisition is associated with undeveloped acreage
that may not be economic.
A large portion of the acreage we are acquiring in the GC Acquisition is undeveloped, and our
plans, development schedule and production schedule associated with the acreage may fail to
materialize. As a result, our investment in these areas may not be as economic as we anticipate,
and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties.
Other Risks
Proposed ballot initiatives in Colorado, if approved, could have severe adverse effects on our
operations, reserves and financial condition.
As previously disclosed, certain groups opposed to oil and natural gas development generally,
and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have advanced various proposed ballot initiatives that
would limit or prohibit oil and natural gas development activities in Colorado. Proponents are
attempting to collect the required number of signatures to have two such proposals included on
the ballot for the November 2016 election. One would amend the Colorado constitution to impose
a minimum distance of 2,500 feet between wells and any occupied structures or "areas of special
concern", including public and community drinking water sources, lakes, rivers, perennial or
intermittent streams, creeks, irrigation canals, riparian areas, playgrounds, permanent sports
fields, amphitheaters, public parks and public open space. If implemented, this proposal would
make the vast majority of the surface area of the state ineligible for drilling, including substantially
all of our planned future drilling locations. The second proposal would amend the state
constitution to give local governmental authorities the ability to regulate, or to ban, oil and gas
exploration, development and production activities within their boundaries notwithstanding state
rules and approvals to the contrary. If implemented, this proposal could cause us to be subject to
onerous, and possibly inconsistent, regulations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, or to
outright bans on our activities in various jurisdictions. Because all of our operations and reserves
are located in Colorado, the passage and implementation of either of these proposals would
likely have a materially adverse effect on our operations, reserves, financial condition and
business generally.
