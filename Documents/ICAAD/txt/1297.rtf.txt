JUDGMENT

1.      
The three assessors have returned with a unanimous verdict against the accused, finding him guilty of 2 counts of indecent assault (count no. 1 & 2) and 2 counts of rape (count no. 3 & 4).

2.      
Obviously, the three assessors have accepted the prosecution's version of events and have found that they have proven beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused, on the four counts.

3.      
I have reviewed the evidence called in this trial and I have directed myself in accordance with the Summing Up I gave the assessors today. The verdict of the assessors' was not perverse and it was open to them to reach such conclusion on the evidence.

4.      
I accept the three assessors' unanimous verdict. I find the accused guilty as charged on all four counts and I convict him accordingly on those counts.
