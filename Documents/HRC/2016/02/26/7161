</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned at </i>the Israeli actions undermining the sanctity and inviolability of 
</p>
<p>religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem,

</p>
<p>access to their Christian and Muslim holy sites, including Al Aqsa Mosque, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying power, 
</p>
<p>including those limiting access of Palestinians to their properties and  holy sites particularly in 
</p>
<p>Occupied East Jerusalem, on the basis of national origin, religion, sex, age or any other 
</p>
<p>discriminatory ground,  which are in grave violation of the Palestinian People's civil, political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>

</p>
<p>Jerusalem, particularly the confiscation of lands and properties, the demolishing of houses and 
</p>
<p>private properties, the construction and expansion of settlements, the continuous construction of 
</p>
<p>the separation Wall, changing the demographic and geographic character of East Jerusalem, the 
</p>
<p>restrictions on the freedom of movement of the Palestinian  citizens of East Jerusalem, as well as 
</p>
<p>the continuous digging and excavation works in and around Al-Aqsa mosque and its vicinity; 
</p>

</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory as provided for  in the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the core International Human Rights instruments, the Hague Conventions, and the 
</p>
<p>Geneva Conventions, and to allow Palestinian citizens and worshippers unhindered access to 
</p>
<p>their properties and religious sites therein; </p>
<p>4. <i>Demands also</i> Israel, the occupying power to immediately cease all digging and 
</p>
<p>excavation works and activities beneath and around Al Aqsa Mosque and its vicinity, and refrain 
</p>
<p>from any acts or operations that may endanger the structure or foundations or change the nature 
</p>
<p>of holy sites both Christian and Islamic in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem; </p>
