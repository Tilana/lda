</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,

development, provide the framework for all actions concerning children, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> <i>with appreciation </i>the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
of other United Nations treaty bodies regarding children&#8217;s access to justice, 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming </i>the attention paid by the special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council to the rights of the child in the context of their respective mandates, in particular by 
the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
and taking note with appreciation of the annual report of the Special Rapporteur to the 
Human Rights Council,1 in which she provided an overview of the main issues relating to 
her mandate, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the important contributions of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Violence against Children and of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict to the promotion and protection of the 
rights of the child, and taking note of their recent reports,2 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the joint report of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child

</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the importance</i> of preventing violations of the rights of the child before 
they occur, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the right to access to justice for all, including obtaining a quick, 
effective and fair response to protect rights, prevent or solve disputes and control abuse of 
power through a transparent and efficient process in which mechanisms are available, 
affordable and accountable, forms an important basis for strengthening the rule of law 
through the administration of justice,

<p> 
</p>

  A/HRC/21/25. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the importance</i> of accountability for violations and abuses of the rights of 
the child, in any circumstance, including for those committed in the family, school and 
other institutions, as well as during armed conflict, and the need to bring perpetrators to 
justice, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that every State should provide an effective framework in which children 
can pursue remedies to redress human rights violations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration to 
be respected in pursuing remedies for violations of the rights of the child, and that such 
remedies should take into account the need for child-sensitive procedures at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that child-sensitive justice should be accessible, age-appropriate, speedy, 
diligent, adapted to and focused on the needs and rights of the child, and should fully 
respect the rights of the child, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that children worldwide suffer violations of their rights, while not all of 
them have access to a fair, timely and effective remedy, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the various barriers to children&#8217;s access to justice, including lack of 
awareness of the rights of the child, restrictions on the initiation of or participation in 
proceedings, the diversity and complexity of procedures, lack of trust in the justice system, 
lack of training of relevant officials, de jure and de facto discrimination, certain cultural and 
social norms, the stigma on the children associated with certain crimes, and physical 
barriers, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the need to prevent secondary victimization of children by the justice 
system in procedures involving or affecting them, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> that, despite the recognition of the right of the child to 
express his or her views freely on all matters affecting him or her, and bearing in mind their 
evolving capacities, children are still seldom seriously consulted and involved in such 
matters owing to a variety of constraints and impediments, and that the full implementation 
of this right in many parts of the world has yet to be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the issue of access to justice 
for children, 
</p>

for Human Rights on access to justice for children;<footnote name="6">A/HRC/25/35. </footnote>

effective remedy;

as are accorded to adults, including all fair trial guarantees, while enjoying at the same time 
the right to special protection because of their status as children; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Emphasizes</i> that all children in contact with the justice system, including 
children alleged as, accused of or recognized as having infringed penal law, victims and 
witnesses or children coming into contact with the justice system for other reasons, such as 
regarding their care, custody or protection, and in the context of administrative justice, 
including immigration, are entitled to the safeguarding of their rights, without 
discrimination of any kind; 
</p>

</p>

language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property,

entire process, bearing in mind that the concept of the child&#8217;s best interests is aimed at 
ensuring both the full and effective enjoyment of all the rights of the child and the holistic 
development of the child; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recalls</i> the right of the child who is capable of forming his or her own views

to ensure that children are provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or

<p>(<i>a</i>) To ensure a safe environment for children in justice processes and that

proceedings; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> States to strengthen child rights monitoring, reporting and
