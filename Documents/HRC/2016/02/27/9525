<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221;

<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report sets out the activities of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers during 2006, and then describes the various circumstances in which the Special 
Rapporteur has intervened from 1994 to date, in particular situations in which there was a direct 
threat to those working in the judicial system, or where structural problems impinged on the 
effective operation and the independence of the judicial system and undermined the rule of law.  
The aim is to provide an overview of the main findings from the last 12 years. 
</p>
<p> Given the gravity and extent of the problems that beset the judicial system and the rule of 
law, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council devote even greater 
attention to the administration of justice and judicial independence.  Mechanisms to defend the 
judiciary should be strengthened, in particular through the office of the Special Rapporteur, 
whose sphere of action should be enhanced.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur underlines the 
urgent need for the United Nations to make justice a priority both when providing assistance to 
States and when reviewing its own institutions.  Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
in its endeavours the Human Rights Council should draw on the contributions and experience of 
national and international jurists&#8217; organizations established to defend judicial independence. 
 In response to repeated requests by various governmental and non-governmental 
delegations during the interactive dialogue in the General Assembly, the Commission and the 
Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur also considers the impact of states of emergency 
on human rights, and in particular the ensuing constraints on the judiciary.  In the same context, 
the Special Rapporteur refers to legislation on terrorism, national security and immigration.  On 
the basis of his assessment, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States bring their domestic 
legislation and practice into line with the international principles, judicial practice and standards 
that govern states of emergency, and to this end draws attention to the elements which it is 
essential to include in any legislation in these areas.  Since grave human rights violations have 
been observed in states of emergency, the Special Rapporteur suggests that an international 
declaration should be drafted to consolidate the body of principles and case law that govern the 
protection of human rights in such circumstances. 
</p>
<p> Against the backdrop of the dramatic deterioration of the situation in Iraq and the 
judgement handed down by the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates his criticism expressed to the General Assembly in October 2006, and recommends 
that the United Nations contribute to the establishment of an independent tribunal to comply with 
international standards on human rights. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and urges States to ratify the 
Convention promptly. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the thirteenth report submitted to the Human Rights Council (formerly 
Commission on Human Rights) since the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers was established in 1994, and the fourth report submitted by 
the current Special Rapporteur.  This report is submitted pursuant to Council decision 1/102. 
</p>
<p>2. In this report the Special Rapporteur analyses his activities undertaken through the 
communications procedure and country missions since he assumed his mandate, the aim being to 
give the Council an overview of the nature and extent of attacks on the judicial system.  He also 
addresses a specific and far-reaching issue, namely the impact of states of emergency, and 
related legislation, on human rights and the administration of justice.  Finally, he mentions 
certain major developments in international justice, a matter he intends to address more 
extensively in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES IN 2006 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International meetings 
</b></p>
<p>3. In Geneva, following his attendance at the first session of the Human Rights Council, the 
Special Rapporteur participated in the thirteenth annual meeting of mandate holders of the 
special procedures from 19 to 23 June 2006.  From 20 to 25 September, he took part in the 
second session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where he presented reports on his 
activities in 2005.  On 23 October, he participated in the sixty-first session of the United Nations 
General Assembly, in New York, at which he presented his report A/61/384 and detailed his 
activities during 2006.  The report considers the situation of military justice in the world and 
recommends the adoption of the relevant draft principles drawn up by the expert 
Mr. Emmanuel Decaux.  The presentation gave rise to a lively and extensive debate on the 
substantive issues. 
</p>
<p>4. From 31 July to 4 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur contributed to 
the 17th international course on judicial independence, human rights and the Inter-American 
Democratic Charter, organized by the Andean Commission of Jurists and the Spanish Agency 
for International Cooperation in Cartagena, Colombia.  In his address, he described judicial 
independence as a guarantee of the judicial function. 
</p><p>5. On 26 September, he addressed the Inter-Parliamentary Union seminar in Geneva on 
&#8220;Law and justice:  the case for parliamentary scrutiny&#8221;.  His contributions covered &#8220;The 
presumption of innocence, equality of arms and the right to be tried without undue delay:  what 
parliaments can do to guarantee these essential ingredients of the right to a fair trial&#8221; and &#8220;How 
to ensure an independent and impartial judiciary, a pillar of democracy.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Consultations and preparations for country visits 
</b></p>
<p>6. In June, the Special Rapporteur held meetings in Geneva with several ministers and 
members of various permanent missions, and with representatives of governmental and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations including the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  In October, in 
New York, he again held meetings with representatives from some permanent missions and 
many non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>7. In June, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Maldives in Geneva.  The Minister repeated his Government&#8217;s invitation to 
undertake a mission to that country.  The Rapporteur held consultations on this matter with 
officials of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in order to 
prepare for the visit, which was originally scheduled for November, but then postponed until 
early 2007.  The Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Maldives for its kind invitation 
and for its understanding of the difficulties that obliged him to defer his visit. 
</p>
<p>8. During 2007, the Special Rapporteur also intends to conduct missions to Cambodia, as 
part of the follow-up to a mission by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
and to the Russian Federation.  If possible, the Special Rapporteur will also visit Kenya and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and he hopes to visit Guatemala in 2008.  The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to thank the Governments which have already extended invitations.  Replies 
are awaited from the Governments of Cambodia, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo.  In the future, the Special Rapporteur has expressed a desire to visit the Philippines, 
Nigeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  Replies 
are awaited from the Governments of these countries. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Urgent appeals and letters of allegation addressed 
to Governments, and press releases 
</b></p>
<p>9. Document A/HRC/4/25/Add.1 contains a summary of the allegations sent to various 
Governments and the answers received, along with statistics for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.  
As an indication, between 1 January and 8 December 2006, 97 urgent appeals, 39 letters of 
allegation and 9 press releases were issued.  In response to these 145 communications, 
which concerned situations in 54 countries, the Special Rapporteur received 51 responses 
from 29 countries. 
</p>
<p><b>II. CLASSIFICATION OF THE SITUATIONS ADDRESSED BY 
THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR, 1994-2006 
</b></p>
<p>10. One of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main activities is to consider allegations received and 
decide what action should be taken in response.<b>1</b>  For this purpose, under the generic title 
&#8220;communications&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur has available to him two procedures, urgent appeals 
and letters of allegation, which allow him to consult governments about: 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Depending on the content and scope of the allegations, such steps may be taken individually or 
</p>
<p>together with one or several other Special Rapporteurs. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (a) Circumstances which could affect the independence of judges, prosecutors, 
lawyers or court officials; 
</p>
<p> (b) Circumstances which could constitute a violation of international standards for a 
fair trial; or 
</p>
<p> (c) Other factors relevant to the proper functioning of the judiciary and therefore to 
the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>Urgent appeals are issued where the alleged facts indicate a degree of urgency; letters of 
allegation are sent when the allegation concerns complex circumstances and further factual or 
legal clarification is required before action can be taken.  The Special Rapporteur may also issue 
press releases if he believes that a violation of international norms has occurred or is about to 
occur.  Country visits may be undertaken in response to an official invitation.  These visits are an 
opportunity to involve all interested parties in an assessment of the broad range of topics and 
circumstances directly or indirectly relevant to the judicial system.  Thus, while the 
communications act predominantly as a deterrent, country missions help to enhance knowledge 
of the national context, to ensure an appropriate level of intervention, including on structural 
matters, and to improve follow-up on recommendations. 
</p>
<p>11. An overview is given below of the conditions and circumstances that influence the 
administration of justice, whether in organizational or operational terms, as apparent from the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities and missions between 1994 and 2006.  Since the aim is to 
distinguish different types of situation affecting the judicial system, and given the large number 
of country situations the Special Rapporteur has attended to over the years, this overview will 
not refer to specific countries or cases.  Specific references are contained in the relevant 
documents submitted annually to the Commission, and latterly to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>12. For ease of assessment, the various situations identified have been classified as: 
</p>
<p> (a) Circumstances affecting the independence of judges, prosecutors, lawyers or court 
officials; 
</p>
<p> (b) Standards and practices relevant to the rule of law, jeopardizing the smooth 
functioning of the judicial system and the right to a fair trial; 
 (c) Various specific challenges to the judiciary and its independence, for example, 
states of emergency. 
</p>
<p>Most often a single complaint will raise several of these aspects together, with one violation 
linked to or facilitated by others. 
</p>
<p>13. It is worth noting that the Special Rapporteur is never concerned solely with an 
individual judge or lawyer, but rather with the role that both can play in safeguarding human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for the good of the population as a whole.  His interest lies not 
in the concerns of any particular profession, but in the central role of judges, lawyers and other 
court officials in defending and safeguarding human rights and, more broadly, upholding the rule 
of law. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Circumstances affecting the independence of judges, 
prosecutors, lawyers or court officials 
</b></p>
<p>14. From the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities since 1994 it is clear that, throughout the world, 
those who work in the judicial system face situations that result in violations of their human 
rights.  This includes threats, harassment, intimidation, vilification and various forms of 
interference.  The threats may be direct, anonymous or under cover of a false identity, and may 
be delivered by telephone, post or e-mail.  There may be interference with mail, press 
campaigns, house raids, or travel bans which can even prevent travel to attend events or training 
on human rights or public international law.  Regrettably there are also instances of physical 
attacks, threats of abduction or actual abduction, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, 
torture, and even assassinations and summary executions.  In such cases, complaints to the 
Special Rapporteur often allege inadequate or no effort by the authorities to respond and provide 
protection, even when reports have been submitted to the police or the judicial authorities. 
</p><p>15. Experience shows that those who work in the judicial system are particularly at risk of 
such attacks if they are prominent defenders of human rights.  This includes lawyers for victims 
of enforced disappearance or extrajudicial executions, or those who specialize in sensitive fields, 
for example, terrorism; organized crime such as people trafficking; land ownership; protection of 
the environment and natural resources; advocacy for vulnerable groups such as indigenous 
peoples, or ethnic, linguistic, religious or cultural minorities who are critical of the status quo 
and assert their rights; women who are victims of violence or discrimination; and those who 
oppose war or campaign for their region&#8217;s independence.  Many judges are also subjected to 
pressure, intimidation, death threats or actual assassination attempts because of their role in 
investigating the involvement of politicians or other well-connected figures in assassinations or 
other serious human rights violations.  Confronted with such risks arising from their beliefs or 
activities, those who work in the judicial system are quite often forced to resign, move to another 
town, or go underground or into exile, and the threats may extend to family members.  The 
authorities do not always provide sufficient protection or a clear condemnation of these criminal 
activities, which often go unpunished. 
</p>
<p>16. These circumstances most commonly affect judges and lawyers, particularly when they 
become identified with the cases they take on.  Governments often regard judges and lawyers&#8217; 
efforts to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms as political interference.  Lawyers are 
regularly hunted down and arrested because they are identified with their clients, and continue to 
be harassed by the authorities following their release.  This in turn means that individuals 
accused of sensitive crimes may have difficulty finding a lawyer who will take their case. 
</p>
<p>17. Cases recorded in 2006 show how regularly such circumstances arise.  About 55 per cent 
of communications, relating to some 148 cases in 54 countries, concerned violations of the 
human rights of judges, lawyers, prosecutors and court officials.  Threats, intimidation and acts 
of aggression directed against lawyers accounted for 17 per cent of communications issued by 
the Special Rapporteur, and the corresponding figure for judges and prosecutors was 4 per cent.  
Arbitrary detention and judicial harassment accounted for 26 per cent of communications 
concerning lawyers and 4 per cent of those concerning judges and prosecutors.  Assassinations of 
lawyers, judges and prosecutors accounted for 4 per cent of the total number of communications.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>In some countries, the level of violence was especially high.  For example, in one 
Latin American country, the Special Rapporteur recorded the assassination of 16 employees of 
the judicial system, 63 cases of threats, 2 abductions and 2 cases of exile between January 2005 
and August 2006.  In one Asian country, no fewer than 15 lawyers and 10 judges were 
assassinated with impunity between 2001 and mid-2006. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Standards and practices relevant to the rule of law, the smooth 
functioning of the judicial system and the right to a fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>18. From the various allegations received and missions conducted since 1994, it is clear that 
institutional considerations can affect not only the exercise of judicial authority but also its 
independence, even jeopardizing the rule of law. 
</p><p>19. Corruption of the judiciary is one of the most pernicious threats to the rule of law and one 
of the most difficult to eradicate.  There are many contributing factors.  High levels of corruption 
and judicial apathy are often attributed to the poor remuneration of judges and lawyers and the 
judiciary&#8217;s lack of financial independence; however, the Special Rapporteur would stress the 
significance of other factors such as judges&#8217; ideological or political allegiances.  The Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s experience shows that such factors have a decisive impact on judges&#8217; ability to act 
in an effective, independent and impartial manner, in accordance with their professional ethics, 
particularly when several contributing factors coincide with a weak institutional framework and 
a culture of corruption.  These situations often arise in countries where the principles of judicial 
independence and international fair trial standards are not well established.  The Special 
Rapporteur has therefore strongly urged States to adopt and subscribe to the Bangalore Principles 
of Judicial Conduct. 
</p>
<p>20. The complaints received and missions conducted show that delays in the administration 
of justice are as common as they are disturbing.  Typically violations of the right to judgement 
without undue delay stem from the unnecessary complexity of judicial procedures combined 
with an excessive volume of cases reaching the highest courts.  Particularly in countries in 
transition, problems are also due to inadequate physical infrastructure, usually compounded by a 
chronic shortfall of financial and material resources and support staff.  In conflict situations, 
looting and vandalism may seriously disrupt the work of the judiciary, and States do not always 
take the necessary measures to punish those responsible or to facilitate the rapid repair of the 
damaged infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>21. There are many complex complaints about unequal access to justice.  This problem 
particularly affects the most vulnerable groups (such as children and persons with mental 
illnesses), those who are discriminated against or persecuted (for example, on grounds of their 
sex, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, or religious convictions or practices) and members of some 
social groups (for example, human rights defenders, environmentalists and campaigners seeking 
to protect natural resources).  These same groups often lose out from a failure to enforce court 
decisions, particularly where economic, social and cultural rights are at issue.  Both the lack of 
access to justice and the failure to enforce court decisions relating to economic, social and 
cultural rights are symptomatic of the relationship between key economic and social factors and 
the administration of justice. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. Reforms affecting the judiciary, the judicial service commission or its equivalent, or the 
status of judges and lawyers are often a real setback, since instead of reinforcing judicial 
independence, they undermine it.  This is particularly common in cases where there are 
significant institutional weaknesses, as is often the case in transitional periods, or where 
legislation is rushed through by an executive authority responding to prevailing political 
imperatives, without the benefit of effective parliamentary scrutiny, and bypassing statutory prior 
consultations with the judiciary.  Reform of the Supreme Court is undoubtedly one of the most 
sensitive topics, and in this area transparency in judicial appointments is key to building citizens&#8217; 
confidence in the judicial system as a whole.  Serious interference by the executive branch in the 
composition and functioning of the Supreme Court and corruption within the Court itself are 
recurrent themes in the complaints received, and constitute one of the worst &#8220;ailments&#8221; of the 
rule of law.  While reforms to establish specialized jurisdictions, for example courts to hear cases 
on land ownership or juvenile courts, are generally well regarded, they are not immune from 
risk.  The allegations received show that such jurisdictions are frequently prey to particular 
political interests, and in addition, do not always meet the requirements set out in article 14 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>23. As regards judges, it is often the case that aspects of the statutes governing the judiciary 
or legal safeguards on conditions of practice in fact impair judicial independence, one example 
being when judicial appointments are non-permanent and are within the direct gift of the head of 
State.  Short of this extreme, practices involving discrimination on grounds such as political 
allegiance, religion, beliefs about human rights, sex, sexual orientation, physical disability or 
ethnic origin can leave judges in a precarious position, affecting their employment and 
promotion prospects. 
</p>
<p>24. In some cases, moreover, the prosecutor&#8217;s office and the executive are so closely 
identified that the role of judges and lawyers in a trial is reduced to a mere formality.  For 
example, in many Central Asian countries, the prosecution, representing the State in civil and 
criminal cases, has a decisive influence on the content of sentences, which rarely depart from 
what the prosecution requests. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur received many complaints of various kinds from lawyers 
regarding inadequate, inexistent or disregarded safeguards on the freedom to practise their 
profession.  Prominent concerns included lack of access to clients, which was refused outright or 
restricted to settings where confidentiality could not be assured; denied, partial or delayed 
disclosure of documentation; and inequality of arms throughout the case.  In addition, lawyers 
are often confronted with practices which undermine their ability to defend their clients, such as 
changes of hearing dates without prior notice, decisions to hold hearings in camera, the court&#8217;s 
refusal to admit key evidence or witnesses, or designation of a court-appointed lawyer.  Such 
practices seriously violate the rights of the defence and thus the rights of the accused.  Judges 
and lawyers are often subjected to prosecution, threats, or economic or professional sanctions in 
response to actions that in no way conflict with professional ethics. 
</p>
<p>26. In some countries, disputes have arisen between the executive and lawyers&#8217; professional 
associations.  In others, lawyers&#8217; freedom of association and freedom of expression are directly 
curtailed by measures such as the closure of professional bodies or restrictions on the exercise </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the profession such as the withdrawal of practising certificates.  There have also been 
complaints about attempts to install individuals close to the executive at the head of professional 
associations, and the Rapporteur has recorded instances of professional associations threatening 
to sanction members for taking part in human rights training sessions. 
</p>
<p>27. Freedom of expression on subjects related to the professional activities of those working 
in the judicial system is especially sensitive.  Government authorities often intimidate lawyers 
and judges who express views on the cases they are involved in, including where the case 
concerns human rights violations.  This is particularly prevalent in countries with no regulations 
that give effect to the relevant international principles. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Particular challenges 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur invites the Council to devote particular attention to a number of 
other challenges that confront the judiciary and on occasions threaten the rule of law. 
</p><p>29. Some of the most serious problems recorded, which have given rise to numerous 
complaints, concern the trial of civilians before military courts and the trial of members of the 
armed forces accused of serious human rights violations by their peers.  In response, the Special 
Rapporteur, who has frequently intervened on this subject, presented a report to the sixty-first 
session of the General Assembly on the situation of military justice in the world (A/61/384), and 
recommended the adoption of the draft principles drawn up by Emmanuel Decaux, an expert 
from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly been concerned with restrictions imposed on the 
judiciary under a state of emergency, a legal institution that will be examined in greater detail in 
the next section. 
</p>
<p>31. Special courts are generally associated with a serious violation of the principles of natural 
law, in particular the right to a defence and other procedural guarantees set out in article 14 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  For example, there have been frequent 
complaints about the use of &#8220;faceless&#8221; judges.  This practice, intended to protect judges against 
possible reprisals, calls the procedure itself into question and can entail a denial of justice.  
While it is vital to guarantee the safety of judges and witnesses, this must not be a pretext for 
undermining judicial independence and impartiality. 
32. Over the last three years, the Special Rapporteur has noted a growing number of 
complaints that certain legislation introduced to combat terrorism, and legislation on national 
security and political asylum, restrict rights by precluding or limiting recourse to the justice 
system and according broad powers to the executive.  Typically, such laws suspend 
habeas corpus or <i>amparo</i>, and establish an internal review or appeal mechanism devoid of any 
judicial involvement. 
33. Other complaints referred to the adoption of amnesty laws, which prevented those who 
had authorized or perpetrated grave and systematic human rights violations from being brought </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to justice.  The denials of habeas corpus and <i>amparo </i>are particularly significant in cases of 
enforced disappearances.  These matters were considered in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous 
report on efforts to combat impunity and the right to the truth (E/CN.4/2006/52). 
</p>
<p>34. The death penalty has been especially controversial.  For the purposes of this mandate, if 
a death sentence is handed down following a trial which did not comply with the relevant 
standards, not only is the right to a fair trial violated, so too is the right not to be deprived of 
one&#8217;s life arbitrarily.  Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interventions have been aimed at 
preventing the infliction of the death penalty on juveniles, disabled persons or persons with 
mental health problems. 
</p>
<p>35. Regarding the right to asylum and the obligation on States not to return persons to their 
country of origin or to other places where they would be at risk of human rights violations, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that the allegations generally concern inappropriate recourse to national 
standards incompatible with international standards, or a profusion of diplomatic undertakings 
which are never a sufficient safeguard to justify removal. 
</p><p>36. A significant number of complaints reflect the difficulties many States have in 
reconciling modern, positive law and religious, traditional or tribal law.  Communications 
received by the Special Rapporteur often mentioned stoning for adultery, honour crimes, the 
forced marriage of children and amputations for theft.  Many of these issues have clear gender 
implications and have been the subject of joint action with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences.  The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s approach to all cases is 
to take international human rights law as a starting point, and while traditional justice systems 
are taken into account, they are regarded as having validity only insofar as their principles and 
practices conform to international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE RULE OF LAW AND STATES OF EMERGENCY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Legal regulation of states of emergency 
</b></p>
<p>37. All legal systems in the world provide for the adoption of emergency measures by 
Governments to deal with crisis situations.  At present, a state of emergency may be declared 
only to maintain constitutional order and safeguard institutions when organized community life 
is threatened.  This is the starting point for analysing the state of emergency, an institution which 
departs from the maxim <i>necessitas legem non habet</i> and is regarded as a fundamental tool of the 
rule of law.  Prior to the establishment of the United Nations, and with it an international system 
for the protection of human rights, the prevailing view of states of emergency was distinctly 
absolutist.  The declaration and maintenance of a state of emergency were associated with the 
exercise of State sovereignty, and what little legislation existed on the matter was generally 
confined to establishing a governing authority. 
</p>
<p>38. One of the main challenges facing international human rights law has been to change that 
view, by specifying the legal framework governing states of emergency.  The basic text - on 
account of its universal scope with respect to countries, subjects and rights protected - is article 4 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which lays down the formal and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>material requirements for introducing a state of emergency.  This article has been the subject of 
extensive comments by the Human Rights Committee, particularly in its general comment 
No. 29 on article 4 (Derogations during a state of emergency).<b>2</b>  The delay in the entry into force 
of the Covenant meant that the Commission on Human Rights also became involved in the 
clarification and protection of human rights, including during states of emergency.  The 
Subcommission and the Commission established a special procedure under the successive 
mandates of two Special Rapporteurs:  Nicole Questiaux<b>3</b> and Leandro Despouy.  The mandate 
of the latter consisted of drawing up an annual list of States that had proclaimed a state of 
emergency and a final report presented to the Commission on Human Rights in 1997.<b>4</b>  This 
report contains guidelines for use by States in drafting legislation and explains the legal 
principles governing the declaration and implementation of states of emergency. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Principles governing states of emergency:  relationship 
with the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>39. From the standpoint of international law, a state of emergency, its declaration and its 
application are governed by eight basic principles that are widely applied in the administration of 
justice. 
</p><p>40. The principle of legality relates to the need to have in place and to observe clear and 
precise provisions relating to the state of emergency.  It also calls for monitoring mechanisms, 
including the judiciary, to ensure that the state of emergency is in keeping with the law.  
Observance of the principle of legality during a state of emergency therefore consists of 
observance of the provisions relating to the declaration and application of the state of emergency, 
and of rules and regulations to ensure oversight of the executive by the judiciary.  Although in 
purely formal terms the principle of legality is met by invoking a reason provided for by law, the 
absence of legal definitions for many types of offences, especially those involving terrorism, 
gives rise to serious problems.  In this connection many States have incorporated definitions that 
are clearly contrary to the principle of legality in their legislation.  International human rights 
law stipulates the need for a clear and precise definition of offences and appropriate penalties, 
which are applicable only after their codification.  Given the diverging views on the concept of 
terrorism, it is essential that the courts should be fully independent and competent to monitor 
anti-terrorist legislation and its implementation.  A particularly telling example is a recent 
judgement by the Supreme Court of the Philippines.  It found that although the declaration of a 
state of emergency in February 2006 following a coup attempt was constitutional, in various

 <p> 
</p>
<p>respects it failed the constitutionality test, in particular the order issued to law enforcement 
officers concerning acts of terrorism, since the absence of a definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; gave rise to 
legal ambiguity which could result in arbitrary action.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>41. The principle of proclamation refers to the need to publicize the declaration of, grounds 
for and duration of the state of emergency.  This is an action taken at the domestic level which is 
strictly regulated from the procedural and substantive standpoints.  Although treaties do not 
contain explicit provisions on the subject, it is understood that the proclamation is the 
responsibility of the State&#8217;s political authorities.  What is more controversial is the role of the 
judiciary and its authority to verify whether the formal and substantive requirements applying to 
the act of proclamation are met.  Setting aside the latter until the principle of exceptional threat is 
considered, there is unanimous agreement on the fundamental role of the judiciary in verifying 
whether the formal requirements applying to the state of emergency are met.  South Africa and 
Colombia offer noteworthy examples.  Under the South African Constitution, a state of 
emergency must be declared by Parliament, and the courts have considerable discretion to decide 
on the validity of the declaration and action taken pursuant to it.  Under the Colombian 
Constitution, a state of emergency must be declared by Presidential decree and must be 
subsequently reviewed by the Constitutional Court.  The Constitution expressly provides that the 
decree must comply with international human rights law, a requirement verified by the 
Constitutional Court.  The Colombia office of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights participated in this process and the subsequent 
declaration of unconstitutionality, through an <i>amicus curiae</i> appearance in the Court. 
</p>
<p>42. Like the principle of proclamation, the purpose of the principle of notification is to 
publicize the state of emergency, but in this case within the international community:  States 
which declare a state of emergency must immediately inform other States parties in an 
agreement specifying the provisions suspended and the reasons for the decision.  Only if this 
requirement is met may the State invoke the restrictions introduced before the relevant 
supervisory body.  During his 12-year mandate, the Special Rapporteur on states of 
emergency followed the practice of sending notes verbales to all States requesting information 
about the existence and application of every state of emergency which was notified to him by 
one channel or another - the reasons for proclaiming it, rights restricted, etc.  In this way, the 
authority to monitor States&#8217; compliance with their international obligations during states of 
emergency - which as a rule national bodies do not do - was transferred to the international level. 
</p>
<p>43. The principle of temporality implies a close connection between the duration of the state 
of emergency and the circumstance that gave rise to its introduction.  Through violation of the 
principle of temporality states of emergency become permanent in nature, as a result of which 
the executive holds extraordinary powers.  In such cases the judiciary plays an important role in 
ensuring that the principle of temporality is upheld, by questioning the lawfulness of successive 
extensions of the state of emergency.  However, the exercise of such power by the judiciary is 
often challenged, the assumption being that it is the political authorities which should evaluate 
the circumstances that prompted the declaration and application of the state of emergency.  Yet, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  G.R. No. 171396. 3 May 2006, <i>Randolf et al</i>., <i>David et al. v. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</i>. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>there is an increasing trend for the judiciary to take steps to end the state of emergency once the 
conditions that prompted it no longer exist.  In this connection, and confronted with numerous 
cases of the unnecessary continuation of a state of emergency, the Colombian Constitutional 
Court stated that the restriction of fundamental rights &#8220;must have as its basic purpose the 
preservation of those rights, which may under no circumstances be destroyed but only 
temporarily restricted with a view to restoring the rule of law and the full enjoyment of rights 
and freedoms&#8221;.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The principle of exceptional threat refers to the nature of the danger or alleged event that 
enables the state of emergency to be declared.  It must be an exceptional danger, current or 
imminent, real and specific, which affects the entire nation to the extent that the measures for 
restricting or limiting rights allowed under normal circumstances are clearly inadequate.  The 
existence of such a threat is closely related to judicial oversight of the proclamation of the state 
of emergency, specifically the substantive oversight of the &#8220;exceptional threat&#8221;.  While the 
proclamation is the <i>prima facie</i> responsibility of the political authorities, which are best placed to 
assess the scale of the emergency, the repeated resort to unjustified emergency measures has 
prompted various high-level courts to question <i>en passant</i> the grounds for declaring states of 
emergency.  As far as terrorism is concerned, not every act of terrorism justifies the declaration 
of a state of emergency, since it must pose a real and specific threat to the organized life of the 
nation.  For example, in its ruling resulting in the repeal of part of the Anti-terrorism Act, the 
Judicial Committee of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom questioned whether terrorism 
was an exceptional danger threatening the life of the nation.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The aim of the principle of proportionality is to strike an appropriate balance between the 
measures applied and the gravity of the situation.  This means that any restrictions or 
suspensions should fall strictly within the limits imposed by the exigencies of the situation.  This 
principle foreshadows and shapes the exercise of emergency powers, and is based on the 
essential link with the events which prompt the state of emergency and the appropriateness, 
necessity and strict proportionality of the measures applied.<b>8</b>  Judicial bodies must have the 
authority to suspend emergency measures which are unnecessary or go beyond what is allowed 
under domestic law and international treaties.  Like self-defence, which is one of its foundations, 
this principle implies the existence of an imminent threat and calls for an appropriate balance 
between the threat and the methods used to avert it; the latter, in order to be legitimate, must be 
proportionate to the gravity of the threat.  For this reason, if the grounds for the state of 
emergency are to be considered a legal concept under international law, they must be evaluated 
by an impartial authority.  The judiciary therefore has a position of special responsibility in 
assessing the proportionality of the measures applied during states of emergency.<b>9</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. The principle of non-discrimination during states of emergency may be inferred both 
from article 4, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, in 
general, from the principle of non-discrimination underpinning international human rights law.  
In this connection, provisions which differentiate between nationals and foreigners in terms of 
enjoyment of their rights, including jurisdictional rights, may contravene the principle of 
non-discrimination.  An example of this can be seen in the United Kingdom&#8217;s Anti-Terrorism, 
Crime and Security Act 2001.  This Act empowered the Home Office to detain indefinitely and 
without trial foreigners suspected of participating in terrorist activities who could not be 
deported.  In response to the allegation that the powers contained in the Act violated the right to 
individual liberty, the right to a fair trial, the right to non-discrimination and other rights, the 
Government argued that it was confronted with an emergency.  Three years later, the House of 
Lords Judicial Committee found that it was not acceptable for laws to differentiate between 
foreigners and nationals,<b>10</b> which is reflected in the Terrorism Act 2006. 
</p>
<p>47. Lastly, the principle of the compatibility, consistency and complementarity of the various 
provisions of international law prohibits the application of emergency measures which, although 
admissible under a given international treaty, conflict with other international obligations, 
whether they come under customary or treaty law.  The right to a fair trial - enshrined in 
articles 14 and 9 of the Covenant - must be further analysed in the light of peremptory norms and 
on the basis of obligations arising from other provisions of international law, in particular 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>48. There are peremptory norms which require that general safeguards concerning detention 
must be upheld even during a state of emergency.  Many international precedents have 
identified many other non-derogable rights, such as the right to be informed of the reasons for 
arrest,<b>11</b> providing safeguards against incommunicado or indefinite detention, the right to file a 
petition for habeas corpus, safeguards against abuses during questioning,<b>12</b>and maintaining 
normal standards of proof.  Also inherent in non-derogable rights are procedural measures 
intended to ensure their protection, as a result of which the provisions relating to those 
measures may not be derogated from.  In this connection, the reaction of the Supreme Court of 
the United States is to be welcomed.  In the <i>Rasul v. Bush</i> case the Court found that the 
petitioners had the right to file a habeas corpus petition before any federal court,<b>13</b> thereby 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  See note 7 above. 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  With emergency laws in force in Northern Ireland, the practice of not informing persons 
</p>
<p>arrested of the reasons for their arrest was declared illegal by the courts of the United Kingdom.  
EHCR also refers to the practice in <i>Ireland v. the United Kingdom</i>, p. 76, para. 198. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  Not only are such abuses prohibited, the evidence is considered invalid.  See in this 
connection the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 13 (CCPR/C/21/Add.3), p. 6. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  Regrettably, the Military Commissions Act, adopted in September 2006, among other 
regressive provisions, also ignores this fact. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>opposing the Government&#8217;s position that Guant&#225;namo does not lie within the territory of the 
United States and that persons held there are therefore not &#8220;entitled to the privilege of litigating 
in United States courts&#8221;.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>49. The provisions of international human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary.  The International Court of Justice has ruled that &#8220;the protection offered by 
human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of 
provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in article 4 of the Covenant&#8221;.  The Court also 
held that &#8220;some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law; others may 
be exclusively matters of human rights law; yet others may be matters of both these branches of 
international law&#8221;.<b>15</b>  The provisions of international humanitarian law - which are basically the 
same as those of article 14 of the Covenant - lay down minimum requirements relating to the 
right to due process of law which cannot be derogated from.  Under the Geneva Conventions and 
the protocols to them, the right to a fair trial and the right to due process are non-derogable, and 
their violation represents a grave breach of the Conventions.<b>16</b>  The following are by and large 
the essential components of the right to due process:<b>17</b>  (a) the right to be informed promptly of 
the reasons for arrest; (b) the right to the necessary means of defence; (c) the right to be present 
during the trial; (d) the presumption of innocence; (e) the right to remain silent; (f) the right to an 
independent and impartial tribunal; (g) the right to appeal; (h) the non-retroactivity of criminal 
laws; (j) the right to present witnesses; (k) the principle of <i>non bis in idem</i>; (l) the right to have 
the lawyer of one&#8217;s choosing; (m) the right to legal aid; (n) the right to have the judgement 
pronounced publicly.  If such safeguards are provided during wartime,<b>18</b> there can be no 
justification for disregarding them during peacetime. 
50. In addition to the complementarity of the two branches of international law, the 
non-derogable nature of the right to a fair trial arises from the obligation States have to observe 
and guarantee the rights recognized in the treaties and to offer the possibility of an effective 
remedy in the event of a violation, as provided for under article 2, paragraph 3, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Although this is not one of the 
non-derogable articles mentioned in article 4, paragraph 2, of the Covenant, it is a treaty 
obligation inherent in the Covenant that must be observed at all times.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Impact of states of emergency and other exceptional measures 
</b></p>
<p>51. While the precedents established by the treaty and non-treaty bodies have enabled 
progress to be made in the legal regulation of states of emergency, nowadays there are still many 
cases in which improper conduct by State institutions has an adverse effect on the exercise of 
human rights, in particular as far as the right to a fair trial and the independence of the judiciary 
are concerned.  With regard to the former, the most blatant violations are of the right of habeas 
corpus, the right to legal assistance of one&#8217;s own choosing, the right to appeal before an 
independent court, the right to a public judgement, the right to present one&#8217;s own witnesses and 
the right to a public trial.  Other frequent violations are indefinite detention, without charges or a 
trial, protracted incommunicado detention, obtaining confessions using torture, convictions 
based on such confessions, the violation of the principle of <i>non bis in idem</i> and the 
indiscriminate use of preventive detention.  Measures are also adopted to prevent the judiciary 
from acting as a counterweight to the executive.  Such measures include, for example, replacing 
ordinary courts by military courts or commissions, harassing judges, prosecutors and lawyers, 
removing judges or transferring them to places where they are unable to interfere with the 
executive, subordinating the judiciary to the executive and discrediting or disregarding judicial 
decisions. 
</p>
<p>52. New threats have justified new ways of suspending human rights, in breach of the 
obligations undertaken by States.  Use is made of exceptional measures under ordinary 
circumstances, in disregard of some of the aforementioned principles, namely those of 
proclamation, notification, exceptional threat, proportionality and non-discrimination.  Together 
with the persistence of unlawfully extended states of emergency and the consequent human 
rights violations, nowadays restrictions are frequently imposed that go far beyond the limitations 
and derogations allowed under ordinary circumstances, generally by means of laws on national 
security, anti-terrorist and immigration.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The fight against terrorism poses new challenges.  Terrorism is increasingly presented as 
the justification for declaring a state of emergency, when in fact it may not be, and very often is 
not.  Apart from undermining the guarantees of due process, the fight against terrorism is used as 
a pretext for restricting or denying other rights, such as freedom of expression, freedom of 
association, the free movement of persons, etc.  In this connection, some States have even gone 
as far as to create parallel systems for the administration of justice which completely ignore 
universally applicable standards and avoid the application of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law by describing the accused as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, &#8220;subversives&#8221; or 
&#8220;enemy combatants&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  In this respect it should be emphasized that a measure is exceptional above and beyond the 
</p>
<p>declaration of a state of emergency if it exceeds the limitations allowed under ordinary 
circumstances. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur has followed from the outset the establishment and activities of 
the Iraq Special Tribunal, initially with anticipation and subsequently with concern.  The legal 
problems surrounding the Tribunal, which is now called the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, 
may be divided into four main areas. 
</p>
<p>55. The first relates to the establishment of the Tribunal and its possible violation of the rules 
of war.  The Geneva Conventions prohibit the occupying Power from establishing courts 
<i>ex novo</i>, and although the Statute adopted by the Coalition Provisional Authority was 
subsequently endorsed by the Governing Council and thereafter by the elected Iraqi authorities, 
this does not resolve the original problem.  The changes made to the Statute of the Tribunal and 
its organizational affiliation - there have been several changes in its position in the hierarchy - 
have led to instances of serious incompatibility with the norms of due process and the 
independence of the judiciary. 
56. Besides the many limitations of the Statute of the Tribunal in terms of the time periods 
and individuals covered, as indicated in previous reports, it should be noted that in many respects 
the Statute does not comply with international human rights standards.  The fact that it does not 
rule out confessions obtained as a result of torture or arbitrary detention, includes as offences 
acts which were defined as such only after their commission by Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime, and 
does not protect the right not to testify against oneself has been mentioned by the Special 
Rapporteur and many human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p>57. The third and no less worrying problem concerns the development and conduct of the 
trial relating to the Al-Dujail massacre, with regard to both the pretrial investigation and the trial 
proceedings.  One judge, several proposed judges, three defence lawyers and a court employee 
were assassinated during this trial.  Another judge withdrew from the case after being subjected 
to pressure on account of his former links with the Ba&#8217;ath regime.  The judge who replaced him 
and handed down the judgement had been accused and imprisoned for activities against the 
Hussein regime.  For several months the accused were refused access to a lawyer of their 
choosing, and when they were allowed access, the lawyers in question complained so much of 
threats against them and interference in their work that they were expelled from the trial. 
</p>
<p>58. The death sentence imposed on several of the accused is of particular significance.  
Above and beyond the widespread current condemnation of the death penalty, whose 
reintroduction in Iraq<b>20</b> made it impossible for the United Nations to cooperate in the 
establishment of the Tribunal, there is broad consensus even among those who support this type 
of sentence that it cannot be handed down unless all judicial safeguards have been respected.  
This was not the case in the trial held in the wake of the Al-Dujail massacre; thus to enforce the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  After being briefly suspended by the occupying Powers. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sentence would not only violate the right to due process, but also the right not to be arbitrarily 
deprived of one&#8217;s life.  This is tantamount to violation of a peremptory norm that would shatter 
the foundations on which the new Iraq is to be built.  It would also have a harmful effect on the 
right to justice and the right of many other victims of the serious and repeated crimes committed 
by Saddam Hussein to obtain compensation.  Lastly, some believe that the enforcement of the 
death sentence would be an aggravating factor in the civil war which is unfolding in Iraq and the 
spread of violence throughout the region. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Extraordinary Chambers in Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is pleased that the Extraordinary Chambers in Cambodia have 
initiated the prosecution of the senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge for the heinous crimes 
committed between April 1975 and January 1979.  The Special Rapporteur notes with 
satisfaction that on 3 July 2006, the Cambodian and international judges were sworn in, and, 
immediately after taking up their duties, invited the public and several experts to comment on the 
rules of procedure of the Chambers.  Also particularly welcome is the fact that the prosecutors 
have started their investigations.  In this connection, the Special Rapporteur applauds the 
transparency of the procedure established. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>60. Analysis of the activities carried out through communications and missions between 1994 
and 2006 highlights the magnitude and gravity of situations adversely affecting the judicial 
system and those involved in it, and their negative impact on the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>61. It is a matter of concern that despite the legal guarantees provided by each State and the 
many international instruments intended to preserve their independence, lawyers, judges, 
prosecutors and court officers in all regions are frequently subjected to pressures, harassment and 
threats that may result in their enforced disappearance, assassination or extrajudicial execution, 
simply because they are doing their job. 
</p><p>62. Also of concern are the wide range of situations which undermine the independence of 
judicial systems throughout the world, and their impact on the rule of law, insofar as the 
judiciary is one of its main guardians. 
63. The large number and frequency of activities engaged in by the Special Rapporteur 
through communications and country visits demonstrate the intensity of the work being 
undertaken and the need to strengthen this procedure.  With the support of NGOs and the 
positive response by States to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications, it is often possible to 
prevent or put a stop to many violations.  In addition, other types of action, such as that taken in 
Ecuador where prominent international and judicial figures and institutions were involved in 
resolving the problems affecting them, may be considered &#8220;good practices&#8221; that should be 
followed. 
</p>
<p>64. A state of emergency is a legal institution governed by the rule of law, so that judicial 
oversight is of vital importance both in checking that it has been lawfully declared and in 
protecting human rights while it is in force. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. However, the activity of the Special Rapporteur shows that the administration of justice 
in general, and the right to due process in particular, are among the principal victims of 
exceptional measures.  Often, judicial oversight of executive action is weakened by measures 
intended to undermine the independence of the judicial system during crisis periods.  Similarly, 
through legislative reforms and other provisions, practices such as indefinite detention without 
charges, restriction of the right to legal aid, the expulsion of foreigners to countries where torture 
is practised, and the establishment of special pseudo-courts that do not meet the minimum 
requirements of independence and impartiality have become widespread. 
</p>
<p>66. The report also covers situations in which the judiciary has displayed independence and 
determination in responding to such measures, highlighting the importance of efforts by the 
judiciary to put a stop to <i>ultra vires </i>acts by other authorities.  Starting from the premise that the 
lives of citizens must be protected and the fundamental values of the nation upheld, some courts 
have challenged the grounds governments give for declaring states of emergency, and have, 
among other things, questioned whether terrorism is an &#8220;exceptional danger threatening the life 
of society&#8221;.  What is more, in many cases they have annulled measures that are particularly 
detrimental to fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur pays particular attention in his work to the activities of the 
specialized tribunals.  This report refers to two of them, including the tribunal in Iraq, whose 
activities have been followed up in a series of reports, and where he has had to intervene on 
many occasions as a result of the assassination of judges, lawyers and court officers and the 
failure to observe international standards relating to the right to a fair trial.  The establishment of 
the Extraordinary Chambers in Cambodia is welcomed, and efforts to end the impunity of those 
who have committed grave human rights violations are encouraged. 
</p>
<p>68. Lastly, opportunities for spreading information about the special rapporteurs&#8217; activities 
have increased considerably with developments in computer science and the media.  This has 
also served to enhance the efficiency of their missions and the interest of the general public in 
their results.  Such topical visibility is a fundamental and integral part of the work of experts. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Special Rapporteur invites the Human Rights Council to increase still further 
its efforts to defend the work being accomplished by different actors involved in the 
administration of justice and to consider every year the scale and gravity of problems 
affecting the judicial system and its independence, with a view to recommending that States 
should adopt specific measures intended to guarantee to judicial employees the safety and 
protection they require to perform their duties properly. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> In the light of the findings set out above, it is imperative for the Council to 
strengthen the work of the Special Rapporteur by granting him the resources he needs to 
do his work more effectively, and to enable him to expand his activities. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> It is also important that in its support and technical cooperation activities the 
United Nations should promote the theme of justice, especially with respect to countries 
which are in transition or are recovering from an armed conflict which has had a serious 
impact on nation-building. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>72.<b> Bearing in mind that the administration of justice is one of the pillars of the rule of 
law and the democratic system, the defence of justice must be accorded priority when 
analysing the institutional aspects encompassed by the activities of the United Nations as a 
whole. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Considering the dynamic and leading role now played by national and international 
associations of jurists to promote an independent judiciary, it would be appropriate for the 
United Nations to take account of their input and experience in its technical cooperation 
and other activities relating to the promotion and protection of human rights.  Accordingly, 
the Special Rapporteur intends to work to bring about this rapprochement between the 
United Nations and judicial circles. 
</b>74.<b> Concerning states of emergency, it is imperative that States should bring their 
domestic legislation and practices into line with international principles, judicial practice 
and standards relating to the application of states of emergency.21 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> As far as the administration of justice is concerned, it is imperative that legislation 
relating to states of emergency should in all cases prevent: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Measures which invalidate the provisions of the Constitution or basic law 
and legislation relating to the appointment, mandate and privileges and immunities of 
members of the judiciary, and their independence and impartiality; 
 (b) Measures which limit the jurisdiction of the courts:  (i) to consider whether 
the declaration of a state of emergency is compatible with the laws, Constitution and 
obligations under international law, and whether it is unlawful or unconstitutional, in the 
event of incompatibility; (ii) to consider whether any measure adopted by a public 
authority is compatible with the declaration of the state of emergency; (iii) to take legal 
action to ensure the observance and protection of any right enshrined in the Constitution 
or basic law and in national or international law that is not affected by the declaration of 
the state of emergency; (iv) to try criminal cases, including offences relating to the state of 
emergency. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Bearing in mind that states of emergency continue to give rise to serious human 
rights violations, the Special Rapporteur recommends that an international declaration 
should be drafted which incorporates existing practices and principles and whose purpose 
is to ensure the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms during states of 
emergency.  A single text would provide clear guidance for States on how to bring their 
conduct into line with international law during crisis periods.  In this connection, it is 
recommended that the Human Rights Council should establish a mechanism to draft

<p><b>21
</b>  This refers in particular to the principles set forth in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 1997 report, and 
</p>
<p>the case law and general comments of the Human Rights Committee, as well as the wealth of 
case law produced by the regional human rights monitoring bodies. </p>

<p><b>the declaration, and, at the same time, should seek the opinion of the sectors concerned by 
this matter.  To this end, the Council is requested to ask the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to hold an international expert seminar during 2007 
to prepare the ground for the proposed instrument. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> As far as the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal is concerned, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates emphatically the recommendations he made to the 
General Assembly in October 2005:  that the Iraqi authorities should be urged to follow the 
example of other countries with shortcomings in their judicial systems, by seeking the 
assistance of the United Nations in the establishment of an independent tribunal which 
complies with international human rights standards; and also that it should refrain from 
imposing the death penalty under all circumstances. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> With regard to the Tribunal in Cambodia, the Special Rapporteur urges the judges 
to ensure that the rules of procedure contain all the necessary provisions to ensure that the 
trials are conducted in full compliance with international standards relating to the right to 
a fair, impartial and independent trial. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges all States to ratify promptly the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which was 
adopted recently.</b>
