<p><b>Human Rights Council 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/36. Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms the right 
</p>
<p>to freedom of opinion and expression,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
</p>
<p>reaffirms, in article 19, the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as 
</p>
<p>well as the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and 
</p>
<p>impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in 
</p>
<p>writing or in print, in the form of art or through any other media of their choice and 
</p>
<p>noting that these rights and freedoms are among those which give meaning to the right 
</p>
<p>to participate effectively in a free society,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful also</i> that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political  
</p>
<p>Rights provides that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it 
</p>
<p>special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, 
</p>
<p>but that these shall be only such as are provided by law and are necessary for respect 
</p>
<p>of the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of national security or of 
</p>
<p>public order (<i>ordre public</i>), or of public health and morals, and that article 20 
</p>
<p>provides that any propaganda for war or advocacy of national, racial or religious 
</p>
<p>hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be 
</p>
<p>prohibited by law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> resolution 2005/38 on freedom of opinion and expression adopted 
</p>
<p>by the Commission on Human Rights on 19 April 2005, and recalling all its previous 
</p>
<p>resolutions on this issue,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</p>
<p>is one of the essential foundations of a democratic society; is enabled by a democratic </p>

<p>environment which, inter alia, offers guarantees for its protection; is essential to full 
</p>
<p>and effective participation in a free and democratic society; and is instrumental to the 
</p>
<p>development and strengthening of effective democratic systems,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion 
</p>
<p>and expression is an important indicator of the level of protection of other human 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms, bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, indivisible, 
</p>
<p>interdependent and interrelated,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that violations of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression continue to occur,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the need to ensure that invocation of national security, including 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism, is not used unjustifiably or arbitrarily to restrict the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing also</i> the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive 
</p>
<p>and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to 
</p>
<p>information, to democratic participation, to accountability and to combating 
</p>
<p>corruption,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of all forms of media, including the print media, 
</p>
<p>radio, television and the Internet, in the exercise, promotion and protection of the right 
</p>
<p>to freedom of opinion and expression, and also the importance for all forms of media 
</p>
<p>to report and to deliver information in a fair and impartial manner, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 
</p>
<p>March 2006,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Human Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special 
</p>
<p>Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council&#8221; and stressing that the 
</p>
<p>mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and 
</p>
<p>the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, 
</p>
<p>as well as the right to freedom of expression, and the intrinsically linked rights to </p>

<p>freedom of thought, conscience and religion, peaceful assembly and association and 
</p>
<p>the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs;   
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the reports of the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2006/55, A/HRC/4/27 and A/HRC/7/14), invites all relevant actors to 
</p>
<p>consider the recommendations contained therein, and welcomes his important 
</p>

</p>
