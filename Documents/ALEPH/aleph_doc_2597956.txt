INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT  
To the members of Neon Capital Limited  
 
 
Report on the Interim Financial Report  
 
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial report of Neon Capital Limited (“the company”) 
which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated 
statement  of  comprehensive  income,  consolidated  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and  consolidated 
statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes comprising a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory notes and the directors’ declaration of the Group comprising 
the company and the entities it controlled at the half-year end or from time to time during the half-year. 
 
Directors’ responsibility for the interim financial report  
 
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the interim financial report that gives 
a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
interim financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial  report based on our review. We 
conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  Auditing  Standard  on  Review  Engagements  ASRE  2410 
Review  of  a  Financial  Report  Performed  by  the  Independent  Auditor  of  the  Entity,  in  order  to  state 
whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the interim financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: 
giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2015 and its performance 
for  the  half-year  ended  on  that  date;  and  complying  with  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134  Interim 
Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of the company, ASRE 2410 
requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.  
 
A review of an interim financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial  and  accounting  matters,  and  applying  analytical  and  other  review  procedures.  A  review  is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001.

Conclusion  
 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us

Corporations Act 2001 including:
giving  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  Group’s  financial  position  as  at  30  June  2016  and  of  its 
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and

CORPORATE INFORMATION
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NOTES TO THE HALF-YEAR FINANCIAL REPORT 
For the 6 months ended 30 June 2016 
1. 
The financial report of Neon Capital Limited (the Company) for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised 
for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 30th  August 2016. 
 
Neon Capital Limited is a for profit company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly 
traded on the Australian Stock Exchange and is domiciled in Australia.  
 
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in the directors’ report. 
 
2. 
 
Basis of Preparation 
 
The half year financial report is a general purpose condensed financial report prepared in accordance with AASB 
134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
The half year financial report does not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial 
statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 
2015  together  with  any  public  announcements  made  by  Neon  in  accordance  with  the  continuous  disclosure 
obligations arising under the ASX Listing Rules. 
 
New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the half year financial report are consistent with those followed 
in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial report for the year ended 31 December 2015. In addition to this, 
new accounting policies have been applied for the first time due to the change  of the Company into a listed 
investment company.  The new accounting policies are as follows: 
 
Financial assets 
Financial assets in the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are classified as 
either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or 
available-for-sale investments, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at 
fair value plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit and loss, directly attributable transaction 
costs. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets after initial recognition and, when allowed and 
appropriate,  re-evaluates  this  designation  at  each  financial  year-end.  All  regular  way  purchases  or  sales  are 
purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  under  contracts  that  require  delivery  of  the  assets  within  the  period 
established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category ‘financial assets at fair at fair value 
through profit or loss’. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of 
selling in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective 
hedging instruments. Gains or losses on investment held for trading are recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Recovery of deferred assets 
Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  deductible  temporary  differences  as  management  considers  that  it  is 
probable  that  sufficient  future  tax  profits  will  be  available  to  utilize  those  temporary  differences.  Significant 
management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based 
upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits. 
 
Several new standards and amendments apply for the first time in 2016. However, they do not impact the financial 
performance or position of the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group or the interim condensed 
consolidated financial statements of the Group.
