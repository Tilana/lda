<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourth 
session from 2 to 13 February 2009. The review of Bangladesh was held at the 4th meeting 
on 3 February 2009. The delegation of Bangladesh was headed by Dr. Dipu Moni, Minister 
for Foreign Affairs. At its 8th meeting held on 5 February 2009, the Working Group 
adopted the present report on Bangladesh.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 8 September 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Bangladesh: Argentina, Egypt, and the 
Philippines. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Bangladesh: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted / written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/BGD/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/BGD/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/BGD/3).  
4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Czech Republic, Latvia, Liechtenstein, 
Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Germany was transmitted to 
Bangladesh through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 4th meeting, on 3 February 2009, H.E. Dr. Dipu Moni, Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, made an introductory statement. Her presence at the Universal Periodic Review 
(UPR) in her first overseas undertaking as Foreign Minister of a newly elected Government 
underlined the importance her Government attached to the guarantees of the inviolability of 
fundamental rights provided for in the Bangladesh Constitution.  
</p>
<p>6. She highlighted significant developments since the presentation of the national 
report, particularly the lifting of the state of emergency and the holding of free, fair 
parliamentary elections in the country. The 2008 parliamentary elections, held under a non-
party caretaker government, had witnessed the participation of an unprecedented number of 
voters. For the first time, more women than men had cast ballots. The electoral process and 
the outcome were unreservedly lauded by observers from home and abroad. The state of 
emergency was lifted weeks before the elections, which resulted in full restoration of 
fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>7. Bangladesh thanked the international community for its support in the country&#8217;s 
democratic transition. The Grand Alliance led by the Awami League had won the elections 
with a huge margin, and its election manifesto was clear on the issue of promotion and 
protection of human rights by stating that Bangladesh shall spare no efforts in realizing that 
goal. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/18</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.09-16252 
</p>
<p>8. The National Report was a result of broad consultations with representations of 
various stakeholders, and the consultations with civil society had been particularly 
rewarding as their perspectives had helped shape government positions on a range of issues.  
</p>
<p>9. A number of institutional reforms undertaken to strengthen rule of law and good 
governance were highlighted, including separation of the judiciary from the executive.  
</p><p>10. Reference was made to the establishment in 2008 of a National Human Rights 
Commission, a three-member body headed by a former Supreme Court judge and including 
a distinguished woman from civil society and a representative from a minority community. 
The Commission was empowered to receive and investigate allegations of human rights 
violations from any individual or group and to monitor the overall human rights situation in 
the country and make appropriate recommendations. 
</p>
<p>11. The reconstituted Election Commission had completed the registration of 80 million 
voters, with photographs and biometric features, and. the Rules of Procedure of the Anti 
Corruption Commission had been refomulated. Bangladesh would ensure independent 
functioning of those institutions, and would adhere to its commitment to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption and bring corrupt people to justice.  
</p><p>12. The delegation stressed that economic and social rights were of paramount 
importance: eradication of poverty was the Government&#8217;s top priority and more than half 
the budget had been allocated for poverty-reduction activities. As a result of these and other 
efforts, poverty declined significantly. Bangladesh was often cited for its best practices of 
social safety net programmes and the Government had plans to further widen the social 
safety-net, particularly to combat the impact of the global financial crisis. The 
Government&#8217;s emphasis on education was also highlighted: the education sector received 
the single largest share, about 15 per cent, of the annual budget. 
</p>
<p>13. Bangladesh expressed its commitment to food security for all, emphasizing that it 
had been able to contain the impact of the global food crisis and highlighting its strategy 
both to reduce food prices further by increasing domestic production and to ensure greater 
access to agricultural inputs that would improve farmers&#8217; productivity and income. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation noted the Government&#8217;s intention to institute comprehensive police 
reform. Steps were being taken to update and improve the Police Act of 1961. A draft 
ordinance developed through consultations with all stakeholders stipulated codes of 
conduct for the police, with a particular focus on upholding human rights in the discharge 
of duties and on gender guidelines for the treatment of women and children. The process of 
setting up a victim support centre and a criminal intelligence analysis unit was under way. 
</p>
<p>15. One of the Government&#8217;s foremost goals in the field of human rights was to bring to 
justice all those who committed the most atrocious crimes against humanity during the war 
of national liberation. The Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, had already indicated that 
Bangladesh would seek United Nations help to ensure that the mechanisms adopted for the 
proposed trials of the perpetrators met international standards and safeguarded the basic 
principles of justice. Parliament had passed a unanimous resolution that there would be a 
trial of the perpetrators and the victims may expect redress. Bangladesh was committed to 
reversing the culture of impunity that had afflicted other areas of its national life. The 
Government intended to resurrect due process, expunge extra-judicial modalities and 
objectives, and promote political harmony and reconciliation.  
</p><p>16. Regarding the status of specific groups, the delegation indicated that women in 
Bangladesh were increasingly assuming leadership roles at both national and local levels, 
and that the principal focus had been to eliminate gender disparities in areas of law, 
economics, politics and family. An Inter-Ministerial Committee co-ordinated the 
implementation of CEDAW&#8217;s provisions, resolute action had been taken to stop violence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/11/18</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-16252 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>against women, and One-Stop Crisis Centres (OCC) established in all six Divisions for 
victims of violence provided victims with emergency medical treatment, police assistance, 
legal aid, and shelter facilities.  
</p>
<p>17. The delegation provided information on recent amendments to the Citizenship Act. 
According to the Bangladesh Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2008, children born of a 
Bangladeshi woman married to a non-Bangladeshi were now entitled to Bangladeshi 
citizenship. The delegation also referred to special measures taken to address feminization 
of poverty, including the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) Programme with 
nationwide outreach covering nearly 750,000 poor rural women.  
</p>
<p>18. Concerning children, reference was made to the National Plan of Action against 
Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children, including Trafficking, and to the National 
Social Policy on Alternative Models of Care and Protection for Children, which would 
harmonize national laws on juvenile justice with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
Bangladesh had eliminated child labour from the readymade garments sector, and this 
remained a noted case for global replication.  
</p>
<p>19. Among government measures aimed at the development of religious and ethnic 
minority groups, a separate Ministry had been set up for the tribal communities residing in 
the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It was mandated to uphold social, economic, cultural and 
educational rights of the hill people.  
</p>
<p>20. Bangladesh was attentive to the rights of the persons with disabilities. It had 
established 46 Focal Points in government ministries and departments to deal with 
disability issues.  
</p>
<p>21. Both print and electronic media played a role in protecting citizen&#8217;s fundamental 
rights. The existence of some 544 daily newspapers, 357 weeklies, 62 fortnightlies and 93 
monthlies was an example of a vibrant print media.  
</p>
<p>22. Bangladesh acknowledged that the contribution of civil society and NGOs to 
national socio-economic development and to the promotion and protection of human rights 
had been praiseworthy. Government-NGO partnership was a hallmark of Bangladesh&#8217;s 
development scene. Coordinated activities took place in areas such as agriculture and rural 
development, physical infrastructure, healthcare and family planning, primary and 
secondary schooling and environmental protection.  
</p>
<p>23. Bangladesh noted there were many discriminations and oppressive practices 
embedded in its age-old social systems and customs. Many of these stemmed from poverty 
and the absence of real development. Resolving them might and would require time. 
However, they would be addressed. Bangladesh had embarked on a path of inclusion by 
striving to guarantee people&#8217;s rights to food, knowledge, security and vote as well as to end 
all oppression. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

<p>25. A number of delegations congratulated the delegation of Bangladesh for its 
comprehensive presentation and for the national report, with its detailed and useful 
information about the country&#8217;s achievements and challenges. A number of delegations 
stressed that Bangladesh had reached out to relevant stakeholders in preparing the national 
report. Delegations welcomed the establishment in 2008 of a National Human Rights 
Commission (NHRC), with a mandate inter alia to receive allegations of human rights 
violations and to review the overall human rights situation in the country. Bangladesh was 
also commended for being a party to most core international human rights instruments and 
for its micro-credit schemes. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of delegations welcomed the successful holding in 2008 of free and fair 
parliamentary elections and the formation of a democratically elected government, events 
that demonstrated Bangladesh&#8217;s firm belief in democracy, heralded the return of democratic 
rule and constituted an essential element for the democratic transition. 
</p>
<p>27. A number of delegations welcomed the significant advances in the field of primary 
education, being mandatory and free of charge. Schoolbooks are free of charge. Annual 
allocations for education amounted to 15 per cent of the general budget, with impressive 
gains in the high net enrolment rate and the positive enrolment ratio of girls to boys. 
Bangladesh was commended for achieving the MDG related to gender parity in primary 
and secondary education, and for the decrease in girls&#8217; school drop-out rates. 
</p>
<p>28. A number of delegations welcomed the progress achieved in the field of human 
rights despite the major challenges that Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated 
countries, faced because of economic and environmental difficulties.  
</p>

Council on the issue of climate change and human rights. Noting the considerable efforts 
made for women&#8217;s rights, Algeria enquired about the challenges faced and the measures 
taken to overcome social difficulties impeding the realization of women&#8217;s rights. Algeria 
recommended that Bangladesh, with the assistance and cooperation of the international 
community, pursue its efforts for the realization of rights of women and women&#8217;s 
empowerment as an important sector of society that can contribute significantly to the 
development of the country. Algeria welcomed the major efforts made to reduce poverty 
and improve living conditions. It recommended that Bangladesh, with the assistance and 
cooperation of the international community, pursue its efforts, despite constraints, to 
combat poverty, particularly among women, including material and non-material poverty 
(in terms of exclusion). 
</p><p>30. United Arab Emirates commended the efforts made by Bangladesh to provide the 
necessary legislative framework to protect human rights, enshrined in the constitution and 
national laws, by giving full regard to international instruments. They also praised the steps 
taken to promote the right to education and requested clarifications about the initiative of 
non-formal education. 
</p>
<p>31. Cuba stressed the serious commitment of Bangladesh to human rights, and the huge 
efforts made to combat hunger and poverty and guarantee basic needs, particularly in the 
areas of food, housing, education and health, especially in times of financial crisis. Cuba 
highlighted the priority given to the rights of women, particularly regarding their 
participation to economic, political and social life, and the importance given to the rights of 
the child. It recommended that Bangladesh pursue (a) its positive efforts to promote and 
protect the right to education, including the education of girls, and (b) its positive efforts for 
the promotion and protection of the rights of women.

women&#8217;s health during pregnancy and post natal care.  
</p>
<p>33. Venezuela noted that more than 60 million people live below the poverty line in 
Bangladesh and acknowledged the efforts made to reduce poverty. It encouraged 
Bangladesh to spare no efforts to consolidate programmes of social protection and 
assistance, in particular programmes for the transfer of food, development programmes on 
behalf of vulnerable groups, particularly women in poverty, and micro-credit programmes 
which have produced positive results for this segment of the population. Venezuela 
requested more information on the Strategy for Poverty Reduction in the Lagging Regions 
of Bangladesh, which should take into consideration the impact of the international food 
and financial crises. 
</p>

remained at the core of its development initiatives. She also noted that Bangladesh suffered

92. The Minister expressed hope for a better understanding of the need to address the 
development concerns faced by Bangladesh and for support of the international community 
in this regard. She emphasized that achieving the MDGs was one of the necessary pre-
