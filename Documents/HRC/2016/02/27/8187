<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is presented pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 8/4 and 17/3  
and to the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s initial report (A/HRC/17/29 and Corr.1), in which he 
identified quality in education as one of the emerging concerns to be examined during his 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>2. Considerable progress has been made since the World Education Forum in Dakar, in 
April 2000, with regard to universalizing access to primary school education in the pursuit 
of the Education for All (EFA) goals. However, this remains seriously compromised by the 
low quality of education provided. There is widespread concern with quality education and 
poor learning achievements. This has given rise to a number of international initiatives, and 
the right to quality education has emerged as a key issue for moving the EFA agenda 
forward and accelerating progress in achieving education-related Millennium Development 
Goals 2 and 3. 
</p>
<p>3. It is essential to promote the right to education both as entitlement in terms of 
universal access to basic education, and as empowerment in terms of acquisition of 
knowledge, skills and competencies and their quality.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur sent questionnaires to States, international and civil society 
organizations to collect information on norms and standards for quality in education. State 
responses, contributions from United Nations agencies and civil society organizations as 
well as information collected through several studies have been highly useful in preparing 
the report. The Special Rapporteur is particularly grateful to all the States and organizations 
which responded to the questionnaire and provided valuable information.1 
</p>
<p>5. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to 
Kazakhstan. He also presented a report to the 66th session of the General Assembly 
(A/66/269), in which he addressed the issue of domestic financing of basic education. The 
report detailed human rights obligations for financing education and provided practical 
examples of national legal frameworks ensuring adequate financing. It also contained an 
update on education in emergencies, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 64/290 
(2010). 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur participated in a number of public events on education, and 
established collaboration with States, international and non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>7. In April 2011, he participated in the first Pan-African Conference on Teacher 
Education and Development (PACTED) in Lom&#233;. On the same occasion, he participated in 
the Economic and Social Council, Annual Ministerial Review - Regional preparatory 
meeting for Africa. In June 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in the meeting,  
&#8220;Tackling violence in schools,&#8221; organized in Oslo, and gave a keynote address at the

disadvantaged children &#8211; the situation of the Roma,&#8221; held in Bratislava. 
</p>
<p>8. In July 2011, the Special Rapporteur gave a statement at the Annual Ministerial 
Review held during the High-Level Segment of the substantive session of the Economic 
and Social Council, which focused on internationally agreed goals and commitments with 
regard to education.   
</p>
<p>9. In August 2011, he participated in the first World Summit of African Descendants, 
in La Ceiba, Honduras, and emphasized the key role that the right to education can play in 
the empowerment of Afro-descendants. Participating in the Social Forum of the Human 
Rights Council in Geneva in October 2011, he stressed the pivotal role of the right to 
education in promoting the right to development. He also made opening remarks at a 
parallel event organized by UNESCO in New York in October 2011 for the release of the 
<i>Global Education Digest 2011</i>, focusing on secondary education, the next great challenge.  
</p>
<p>10. In December 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in a colloquium devoted to 
indicators for parents&#8223; participation in education (IPPE) and quality education, organized in 
Madrid by a European consortium of universities and civil society institutions. 
</p>
<p>11. In January 2012, as part of a periodic dialogue, the Special Rapporteur exchanged 
views with the NGO Platform on the Right to Education, on the theme of the present report. 
In March 2012, he addressed the Right to Education Forum in New Delhi during the NGO 
Platform&#8223;s national consultation on quality education.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Widespread concern with the low quality of education  
</b></p>
<p>12. Concerns with the low quality of basic education have been expressed at the 
international, regional and national levels. Similar concerns have also been expressed 
consistently by the High-Level Group on EFA, with Governments&#8223; committing to 
improving the quality of education by moving the EFA agenda forward. In this context, the 
Global Compact on Learning initiative, for example, is driven by the need to respond to the 
learning crisis: &#8220;Beyond the 67 million children who are not attending primary school in 
</p>
<p>low-income countries, there are countless children who are going through five years of 
education without learning basic reading, writing and math skills.&#8221;2  
</p>
<p>13. Concerns with the low quality of education are underlined in different regions. In the 
Asia-Pacific region, a recent review of EFA goal 6, to improve the quality of education, 
noted that many children lack the most basic literacy and numeracy skills. Average student 
performances in reading and mathematics are near or below basic competency levels set by 
international standards3 and concerns are mounting over the perilous state of the quality of 
education. In Latin America and the Caribbean, a study on guaranteeing the quality of 
education for all found that &#8220;the state of education is replete with great challenges and 
</p>
<p>urgency due to the fact that what is at stake is the present and future of millions of people.&#8221;4 
In the Middle East and North Africa, improving quality of education is regarded as one of

<p>the most important and urgent challenges for the future.5 In sub-Saharan Africa, an analysis 
of 21 countries found that 22-24 year-olds with five years of education had a 40 per cent 
chance of being illiterate.6 Testing conducted by the Southern Africa Consortium for 
Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) showed that in some countries, less than 10 
per cent of students reached the standards expected in the curriculum.7  
</p>
<p>14. Similarly, regional gatherings are resulting in further commitments to promote 
quality in education. A regional workshop of the second Forum of the Asia Pacific 
Parliamentarians for Education (FASPPED), organized in Teheran in 2011, proposed 
guidelines for strengthening various aspects of quality in education.8 The Doha Declaration 
on quality of education in the Arab World9 provides a regional platform for improving the 
quality of education in the Arab region. The need to increase access to education, improve 
its quality and relevance and ensure equity is the underlying thrust of the Second Decade of 
Education for Africa (2006-2015) and the Framework for Action. The &#8220;need for all children 
to have equity of access to quality education, regardless of geographical location, resources, 
gender, ethnicity and ability, in order to equip them to interact effectively in a global 
community&#8221; is also underlined by the Commonwealth of Education Ministers.10 The 
Memorandum on quality education, signed at the 54th session of the Conference of 
Ministers of Education of French-speaking countries (CONFEMEN), examined quality in 
all its dimensions, along with the appraisal of the Programme for the Analysis of Education 
Systems (PASEC).11 
</p>
<p>15. At the country level, concerns with quality education come to the fore in the wake of 
international assessments of students&#8223; performance.12 The Programme for International 
Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), a triennial survey to evaluate education systems worldwide, which 
tests 15-year-old students&#8223; performance in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy, and 
benchmarks a country&#8223;s performance against that of other participating countries, is well 
known. Other international assessments have a similar focus, except for PASEC, mentioned 
above, which provides a broader conceptual and comparative evaluation framework.

achievements, assessed in terms of knowledge, skills and competencies, and have

</p>
<p>Germany; see &#8220;Standards for quality in education&#8221; (see footnote 7 above). </p>


<p>implications for a conceptual framework13 concerning quality education. Knowledge and 
skills in reading, mathematics and scientific literacy, predominant in quality appraisals, is 
no doubt crucial. Its conceptual moorings lie in the &#8220;basic learning needs&#8221; as defined in the 
World Declaration on Education for All (1990) and reaffirmed at the World Education 
Forum (2000). This is emerging as a priority in national education development strategies.  
</p>
<p>17. The concept of &#8220;basic learning needs&#8221; includes skills in technical education and 
vocational training as an important component of basic education, and as an integral part of 
generalized secondary education.14 Learning achievements in technical education is 
emerging as a priority for development and for evaluations of quality in education.15  
</p>
<p>18. Achieving knowledge and skills in mathematical and scientific literacy and 
languages should not be treated as being an exclusive reference for the quality of 
education.16 Universally recognized human rights values and democratic principles should 
be embedded in every education system. The acquisition of knowledge about human rights 
values should be at the forefront of any discourse on quality education.  
</p>
<p>19. Many countries17 stress the importance of humanist values in education. Education is 
invaluable for creating a better world by promoting the values of a culture of peace, mutual 
understanding and international solidarity, and its achievements in this regard denotes its 
quality. Overall, there can be no task nobler than giving every child a better future, and 
quality education is indispensable in serving this cause.  
</p>
<p>20. The concept of the &#8220;four pillars of education&#8221; (learning to know, learning to do, 
learning to live together and learning to be)18 provides the basis for a broader conceptual 
understanding of quality education. A well-qualified, motivated and well-looked-after 
teaching force is another central aspect of this holistic conceptual framework. Quality 
hinges upon giving teachers the necessary ability to impart knowledge, values and skills, 
and upon valorizing their status. Moreover, quality education cannot be successfully 
</p>
<p>  
 13  &#8220;Beyond the conceptual maze: The notion of quality in education&#8221; (see footnote 6 above). 
  14  The Education Development Plan in Brazil states that the National Program for the Integration of 
</p>
<p>Vocational Education should guide the integration of secondary education in the State and federal 
secondary education systems. The system of technical education and vocational training in 
Switzerland and Germany also deserve special consideration. 
</p>
<p> 15   Regarding technical education and vocational training, see, inter alia, Bahrain, Belgium, Mauritius, 
Poland and Slovakia. The main objective of the Vocational Training Service (DBO) in Belgium is to 
create the best possible qualification and development opportunities for students/ participants in 
vocational education, as part of the concept of lifelong learning. National guidelines on vocational 
education in Poland are also noteworthy.  
</p>
<p> 16  The European framework of key competences for lifelong learning identifies learning to learn and 
social and civic competences as important and linked, along with the need to develop indicators for 
European Union member States to measure progress made. The development and measurement of 
these competences invoke and require values which promote democracy and human rights. See also 
Bryony Hoskins and Ulf Fredriksson, &#8220;Learning to learn: What is it and can it be measured?&#8221; JRC 
Scientific and Technical Reports, European Communities, 2008.<b> </b>The objectives of education in many 
countries show comparable approaches; for example, the objective of the Universal Basic Education 
Programme in Nigeria is to &#8220;ensure the acquisition of appropriate levels of literacy, numeracy, 
communicative and life skills as well as the ethical, moral and civic values needed for laying a solid 
foundation for life-long learning&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 17  See responses to the questionnaire by Colombia, France, Greece, Portugal,<b> </b>Tunisia and Uruguay. In 
France, education imparts values including humanist culture; in the Russian Federation, the principles 
laid down in the Education Law include &#8220;the humanistic nature of education&#8221; and the &#8220;public 
character of education.&#8221;

<p>imparted without adequate infrastructure and facilities and a school environment in which 
teachers, parents and communities are all active participants in school life.   
</p>
<p>21. Thus, a holistic conceptual framework of quality education comprises: (i) a 
minimum level of student acquisition of knowledge, values, skills and competencies; (ii) 
adequate school infrastructure, facilities and environment; (iii) a well-qualified teaching 
force; (iv) a school that is open to the participation of all, particularly students, their parents 
and the community. It is relevant to underline that quality in education cannot be achieved 
without provision of adequate resources to respond to quality imperatives. 
</p>
<p>22. Quality basic education which is crucial to &#8220;nation-building&#8221;19 constitutes a hallmark 
of the fulfilment of the right to education in the true sense of the term. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The right to quality education and standards 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
establish that education should be aimed at the full development of the human personality 
and the sense of its dignity. Article 26 of the Declaration clearly states that education must 
be &#8220;directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8221; Article 13 of the Covenant specifies 
that education &#8220;shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society, promote 
understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations and all racial, ethnic or religious 
groups, and further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.&#8221; 
Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child goes further in stipulating that 
education must develop respect for human rights, the child's parents, his or her own cultural 
identity, language and values, for the national values of the country in which the child is 
living, the country from which he or she may originate, and for civilizations different from 
his or her own. Education must prepare the child for responsible life in a free society. 
</p>
<p>24. States&#8223; obligations to ensure quality education for girls is further expounded in the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which 
establishes women's right to education, both as entitlement and as empowerment. State 
parties thus have an obligation to ensure, on the basis of equality of men and women, 
access to education at all levels and in all its forms, including &#8220;access to the same curricula, 
the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school 
premises and equipment of the same quality&#8221; (art. 10 (b)).  
</p>
<p>25. The UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education (1960), the first 
legally binding international instrument in the field of education, makes explicit reference 
to the obligation to ensure quality in education: &#8220;the term &#8222;education&#8223; refers to all types and 
levels of education, and includes access to education, the standard and quality of education, 
and the conditions under which it is given&#8221; (art. 1, para. 2). States have an obligation to lay 
down a uniform framework of quality standards applicable throughout the country. The 
Convention provides the basis for combating disparities in education and ensuring equal 
opportunities which involve ensuring quality for all. For example, the establishment or 
maintenance of separate educational institutions for pupils of the two sexes shall not be 
deemed to constitute discrimination if the institutions offer equivalent access to education, 
</p>
<p>  
 19 General Assembly resolution 65/183, United Nations Literacy Decade: education for all. </p>


<p>provide a teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard, as well as school premises 
and equipment of the same quality (art. 2 (a)). 
</p>
<p>26. The UNESCO-ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers (1966) 
provides a comprehensive normative framework on teachers&#8223; status, including their 
</p>
<p>responsibilities, career advancement opportunities, security of tenure and conditions of 
service. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Work of human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes quality as a key 
component of the right to education: &#8220;education offered must be adequate in quality, 
relevant to the child and must promote the realization of the child's other rights.&#8221;20  
</p>
<p>28. In their dialogue with States parties, human rights treaty bodies further concretized 
State obligations and political commitments to ensure quality of education. The Committee 
on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
developed different indicators to measure whether, and if so how, States comply with the 
quality requirement. The treaty bodies have expressed concern about under-resourcing of 
schools, class sizes and teacher/pupil ratios, proportion of untrained teachers and their 
impact on the quality of education received.21 In terms of monitoring the teaching and 
learning process, the Committee on the Rights of the Child noted the narrow content of 
education provided within schools and the lack of supervision of their curricula.22 The 
treaty bodies also used students&#8223; learning outcomes, such as low literacy rates, as indicative 
of limitations of the quality of education provided.23  
</p>
<p><b> C. International political commitments 
</b></p>
<p>29. The international legal framework concerning the right to quality education is 
complemented by international political commitments. The World Declaration on 
Education for All (Jomtien, Thailand, 1990) and the follow-up Dakar Framework for 
Action, adopted at the World Education Forum in Dakar, in April 2000, both recognize 
quality of education as a crucial component in the global movement to achieve Education 
for All. The Dakar Framework explicitly affirms that quality is at the heart of education.24 
</p>
<p>Goal 2 of the Framework commits States to provide primary education of good quality, 
while Goal 6 states that all aspects of education quality should be improved &#8220;so that 
recognized and measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all, especially in literacy, 
numeracy and essential life skills.&#8221; The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has underlined the legal implications of the Framework for Action and its linkage

<p>with articles 13 and 14 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights regarding the right to education.25  
</p>
<p>30. In the outcome document of the high-level meeting to review the progress of the 
Millennium Development Goals, States explicitly commit to ensuring quality in education, 
by providing equitable educational and learning opportunities for all children and ensuring 
quality education and progression through the school system.26 
</p>
<p>31. Similarly, the ministers participating in the High-Level Segment of the Economic 
and Social Council in 2011 recognized that &#8220;providing quality education for children, youth 
and adults helps to develop the knowledge and skills that people and countries need to 
flourish, and that additional measures are required to improve the quality of education and 
to ensure positive learning outcomes for all.&#8221;27  
</p>
<p><b> V. International initiatives to promote quality in education 
</b></p>
<p>32. A number of United Nations specialized agencies have developed indicators and 
benchmarks to measure and promote quality in education. UNICEF developed a framework 
for rights-based, child-friendly educational systems and schools to help fulfil the rights of 
children and provide them with an education of good quality.28   
</p>
<p>33. In 2002, the Global Partnership for Education, comprised of donors and developing 
countries, was launched as the Education For All Fast Track Initiative (FTI) to ensure 
accelerated progress towards universal primary education by 2015 and other EFA goals. 
The initiative proposes indicative international standards, such as an average pupil-teacher 
ratio of 40:1; annual instruction time of 850-1,000 hours and an average teacher salary of 
3.5 x GDP per capita.29  
</p>
<p>34. A comprehensive approach to quality education is reflected in the Memorandum on 
quality education and the Framework for Action adopted by the 54th Ministerial session of 
the Conference of Ministers of French-speaking countries (CONFEMEN) in 2010. The 
Memorandum emphasizes education as a social programme, construes &#8220;quality&#8221; around key 
principles for making education systems better performing and focuses on the following 
elements: curriculum, educational material, teaching personnel, national languages, 
decentralization, resource mobilization, partnerships and evaluation.30  
</p>
<p>35. The Council of Europe is currently developing a recommendation on the right to 
quality education for adoption by the Council of Ministers. This new instrument can enrich 
existing regional and national norms and principles in the field of education. Also, the 
European Commission has developed 16 quality indicators relating to education to assist

<p>efforts to improve the quality of education within national education systems and to 
monitor progress.31  
</p>
<p>36. The Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) developed 
Minimum Standards for Education for a variety of different stakeholders, aimed at ensuring 
quality in coordinated humanitarian response that meet the educational rights and needs of 
people affected by disaster. They include standards relating to access, a secure learning 
environment, teaching and learning, and education policy.32 In his report to the General 
Assembly in 2011 (A/66/269), the Special Rapporteur also highlighted the importance of 
paying attention to quality in education provided in the context of emergencies.  
</p>
<p>37. The concept of quality is also at the centre of the Global Compact on Learning 
initiative to provide quality education to all and to ensure that all children, particularly the 
most marginalized, have access to quality learning opportunities.33   
</p>
<p><b> VI. National legal and policy frameworks for quality in education 
</b></p>
<p>38. The right to quality education is provided for in national legislation in many 
countries, effectively demonstrating how international obligations can be reflected in the 
domestic legal order. In some countries, the right to quality education is a constitutional 
right.34 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. Quality in education is an emerging concern in recent reforms of national education 
systems. These reforms often include the adoption of laws and decrees that set specific 
rules and regulations for the promotion of quality in education. 
</p>
<p>40. One of the first experiences establishing legislation on quality education was in the 
United States of America, where a series of reports highlighting poor learning outcomes in 
schools35 in the 1980s led to a number of initiatives at state levels, using standards to secure 
quality in education. At the national level, this movement culminated in the adoption of the 
No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, which sets national standards and establishes 
measureable goals for quality in education.  
</p>
<p>41. In China, article 3 of the Compulsory Education Law (amended in 2006) stipulates 
that State policy on education shall be implemented and quality-oriented education shall be 
carried out to improve the quality of education. China&#8223;s National Education Plan (2010-
2020) sets improvement of quality in education as one of its main tasks, stipulating State 
standards for quality along with a policy framework to guarantee it.  
</p>
<p>42. Brazil&#8223;s National Education Law (9394/1996) establishes standards for quality, such 
as a national syllabus basis for fundamental and secondary education, as well as teacher 
education requirements. This is in line with article 212 of the Brazilian Constitution which 
establishes that the Federal Government shall organize and govern the education system in

</p>
<p> 34  For example, the Constitution of Morocco (July 2011) recognizes the right to modern education (art. 
31); the Constitution of the Philippines (1987) states that &#8220;the State shall protect and promote the right 
of all citizens to quality education at all levels and shall take appropriate steps to make such education 
accessible to all&#8221; (art. xiv); the Constitution of Thailand also establishes everyone&#8223;s right to receive 
fundamental education of quality (sect. 43).

<p>order to ensure &#8220;the equalization of educational opportunities and a minimum standard of 
quality of education.&#8221;  
</p><p>43. In India, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (2009) 
provides for compulsory education to &#8220;ensure good quality elementary education,&#8221; and 
establishes quality standards. In the course of the implementation of the Act, a series of 
specific quality standards for schools were developed. These standards are compulsory and 
carry legal penalties for schools failing to meet the standards.  
</p>
<p>44. Indonesia&#8223;s Law on the National Education System (2003) establishes the State&#8223;s 
obligation to provide quality basic education to all. Pursuant to the Law, national standards 
were set, laying down minimum criteria for quality to be met by all schools in the country. 
These standards refer to a number of issues, including learning content, learning process, 
teacher qualification, school facilities and school management. Implementation of the Law 
is subject to periodic review (every 5 to 6 years) for improvement and adjustments.  
</p>
<p>45. In Monaco, norms and standards for quality in education are established by Law No. 
1.334 (2007). In line with the Law, policies for quality of education are defined annually in 
the Government programme for the sector, and educational inspections are carried out in 
public and private institutions in order to monitor implementation.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>46. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the principles and standards for education are defined in 
the Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education (art. 21). 
</p>
<p>47. Uruguay&#8223;s national law on education establishes that a fundamental objective of 
national education policies is ensuring lifelong quality learning for all, through both formal 
and informal education.36 The Republic of Korea37 and Mozambique38 have both adopted 
specific rules and decrees on quality education.  
</p>
<p>48. Some countries have institutions dedicated to the establishment and promotion of 
quality standards. In Nigeria, the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic 
Education Commission (UBEC) put in place norms and standard for quality in basic 
education. In Qatar, the Supreme Education Council (SEC) plays a key role in the 
promotion of education reform and has as its aim achieving quality and fostering 
educational creativity.  
</p>
<p>49. A number of additional national initiatives focus on the improvement of quality. In 
Ethiopia, the National Education Sector strategy introduced measures to enhance quality at 
all levels of education. In parallel, the country implements a General Education Quality 
Improvement Programme (GEQIP) which includes measures to promote and to establish 
indicators for monitoring quality in education. In Togo, national norms for quality 
education were established in parallel to a &#8220;minimum package&#8221; of essential elements to 
assist the functioning of an educational establishment. In France, the &#8220;common base of 
knowledge&#8221; defines seven major competencies for pupils to master at the end of 
compulsory education. The Programme for ambition, innovation and success (&#201;CLAIR) 
offers support to enhance the capacity of schools to respond to specific needs of students in 
elementary, junior (coll&#232;ge) and senior (lyc&#233;e) secondary levels.  
</p>
<p>  
 36 Uruguay, General Law of Education, Law no. 18.437 (2008), art. 12. 
 37 In the Republic of Korea, the guidelines and minimum standards for primary and secondary school 
</p>
<p>facilities are set forth in the Rules on the Establishment and Operation of High Schools, art. 3 (school 
buildings); art. 3.2 (complex facilities); art. 4 (sites of school buildings); art. 5 (playgrounds); art. 6 
(school sites).  
</p>
<p> 38 In Mozambique, Decree 29/2009 establishes goals aimed, for example, at improving primary pupils&#8223; 
learning competences in reading, writing, numeracy.  </p>


<p><b> VII. Main elements addressed by national norms and standards 
for quality in education 
</b></p>
<p>50. As outlined, States have developed a variety of instruments to promote standards for 
quality in education, sometimes with technical assistance,39 ranging from laws to policies 
and programmes. Below are examples of initiatives addressing some specific components 
of quality in education. They are by no means exhaustive. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Physical environment  
</b></p>
<p>51. A rights-based, child-friendly school requires a healthy, hygienic and safe learning 
environment, with adequate water and sanitation facilities and healthy classrooms.40 Overall 
norms for the construction and modernization of school buildings are also relevant in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>52. The physical environment requirements can include aspects such as the presence of 
basic facilities (sanitation, separate toilets for girls, ramp for persons with disabilities) and 
adequate infrastructure (lighting, acoustic, safety and security, communication facilities). 
Facilities and equipment in schools must be appropriate in terms of instruction 
needs, health and sanitation, safety and management.41 Specific norms are required for 
infrastructure for technical and vocational education.42<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>53. A number of States have regulations outlining the necessary infrastructure for 
schools. In India, for instance, according to the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory 
Education Act, schools must have an all-weather building, with separate toilets for boys and 
girls, along with a kitchen, clean water for drinking and a playground with a secure 
boundary wall. In South Africa, the Government has developed a School Infrastructure 
Performance Indicator System along with norms and quality interventions required to 
support an equitable, modern, high-quality education system to help track progress and 
identify intervention requirements.43  
</p>
<p><b> B. Class size and pupil-teacher ratio 
</b></p>
<p>54. Class size and pupil-teacher ratio is another important indicator of quality of 
education. Overcrowded classrooms undermine quality education in many developing 
</p>
<p>  
 39  For instance, in Sri Lanka, educational standards were developed with technical assistance from the 
</p>
<p>World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, UNICEF and UNDP; see Standards for Quality in 
Education:  Experiences from different countries and lessons learnt, Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r 
Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), 2011, p. 58. 
</p>
<p> 40  See UNICEF Life skills page, available at http://www.unicef.org/lifeskills/index_7260.html. 
 41  In Japan, the school building must, at the minimum, contain the following facilities: i) classrooms 
</p>
<p>(ordinary, special and others); ii) a library and a nurse's office; iii) a staff room (see responses to 
questionnaire).   
</p>
<p> 42 In Mauritius, as per the Mauritius Qualifications Authority (MQA) (Registrations) Regulation 2009, 
criteria for registration of any vocational training institution include accessibility and environment of 
premises, workspace per trainee, lighting and ventilation, proper fire exit, toilets for males and 
females, electricity, water points and telephone, common area for learners, minimum level of hygiene 
and sanitation, physical condition of building, safety, resource centre/library, laboratory, workshop, 
kitchenette (sect. 4 (a)).

Exchange 2007/6, OECD 2007. </p>


<p>countries. Reducing very large class sizes helps teachers to perform better, and pupils to 
learn more.44 Norms sometimes lay down instructional time to be given to students at 
various grades of schooling, along with working days for teachers as part of their duties.45 
</p>
<p>55. This indicator has been used by countries either in the form of a legal instrument 
with mandatory compliance or as a target or goal. In India, the Right of Children to Free 
and Compulsory Education Act provides a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 40:1 for grades 
1 to 5, and 35:1 for grades 6 to 8 at the elementary level, with specialist teachers for 
science, mathematics, languages and social studies, and a head teacher for any school with 
more than 100 students. In Finland, the Ministry for Education and Culture recommends 
20-25 pupils per class for grades 1 to 6; in Serbia, class size is 25 pupils maximum; while 
in France, average class size is 22.7 pupils. The Republic of Korea aims to bring its pupil-
teacher ratio down to the OECD average by 2020, and in Qatar, the goal is to reach a pupil- 
teacher ratio of 13-15:1.  
</p>
<p>56. Norms for pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes cannot be implemented unless requisite 
teaching personnel is available (see below). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Normative framework for the teaching profession 
</b></p>
<p>57. The quality of education received is heavily dependent on the qualifications and 
motivation of teachers. Hence, the adoption of a normative framework for the teaching 
profession is also extremely important.  
</p>
<p>58. Shortage of qualified teachers is a worldwide phenomenon and the International 
Task Force on Teachers for EFA promotes the teaching profession and improving related 
policies. The critical shortage of qualified teachers assumes alarming proportions, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.46 In this regard, UNESCO has established the Teacher 
Training Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa (TTISSA). Furthermore, the Pan-African 
Conference on Teacher Development (PACTED) was initiated in 2011 with the aim of 
providing a comprehensive policy analysis on the teaching profession. At the national level, 
there are additional examples of targeted initiatives, such as the Nigerian National Strategy 
for Teacher Quality Development, which aims to improve the quality of teaching and 
learning in public and private schools.  
</p>
<p>59. The teaching profession is not attractive enough and often does not enjoy social 
esteem, and this undermines teachers&#8223; morale and motivation. Enhancing career 
development perspectives for teachers is crucial. In this regard, the UNESCO-ILO 
Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers (1966)47 provides a basis for 
developing national laws applicable to all teachers, in both private and public schools.  
</p>
<p>60. Standards ensuring good working conditions for teachers, such as providing a clear 
teaching-career structure, including evaluation, training and progression, and ensuring

<p>management,&#8221; World Bank, 2010, p. 38: in many countries less than 20 per cent of basic teachers 
have the necessary qualifications to teach mathematics. 
</p>
<p> 47  The Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers recognizes that &#8220;advance in education 
depends largely on the qualifications and ability of the teaching staff in general and on the human, 
pedagogical and technical qualities of the individual teachers&#8221; (art. 4).  </p>


<p>adequate salaries, were adopted in several countries. In Germany, for example, teachers 
have either civil servant or public service employee status, which guarantees a very high 
level of employment security. China&#8223;s Teachers Law (1993) recognizes the Government&#8223;s 
responsibility to take measures to strengthen professional training of teachers, improving 
their working and living conditions and raising their social status (art. 4). Further examples 
exist in many countries, including Argentina, Colombia, Indonesia, Latvia, the Philippines 
and Poland.  
</p>
<p>61. Further examples of different types of measures focusing on improving the quality 
of the teaching workforce are provided below.    
</p>
<p><b>  Teachers</b>&#8217; qualification<b>s 
</b></p>
<p>62. States usually have standards that lay down the minimum qualification or experience 
required to enter the profession. Minimum eligibility in terms of qualifications for the 
teaching profession should include at least a university degree, and it should be obligatory 
for State authorities to deploy only qualified and trained teachers in schools.  
</p><p>63. In Portugal, several legal decrees establish a Master&#8223;s degree as the minimum 
qualification for entering the teaching profession for all levels of basic education, including 
preschool education.48 To qualify as a teacher in Albania, a candidate must have a Master&#8223;s 
degree in education, one year of professional training and must have passed the State 
Examination for Teachers.49 In France, initial training equivalent to a Master&#8223;s degree in a 
university is necessary for a teaching position. In Nigeria, the minimum teaching 
qualification is the Nigeria Certificate in Education (NCE). Minimum eligibility 
qualifications for entry into the teaching profession have also been laid down in the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in Finland, including specific training 
prior to deployment in the schools.  
</p>
<p><b>  In-service teacher training 
</b></p>
<p>64. In-service training for teachers is a permanent requirement, not only to cover gaps in 
their qualification, but also to ensure their capacities are adapted to new demands. Training 
must emphasize pedagogical skills and subject mastery. Training may also enhance 
teachers&#8223; capacity to work with new information technologies. In Germany, training is 
regulated by the Standards for teacher training (2004) and the Common content 
requirements for subject-related studies and subject-related didactics in teacher training 
(2008). Regular in-service teacher training has also been reported in the Republic of Korea, 
Senegal and Uzbekistan.50  
</p>
<p><b>  Working conditions and professional development prospects  
</b></p>
<p>65. The working conditions of teachers remain generally poor, with limited incentives 
and career development perspectives. On account of very low salaries, teachers often seek 
to raise extra income by offering private tuition (exerting pressure on students or parents) 
and/or by doing side jobs. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted 
this common concern.51 UNICEF similarly recognizes the importance of enhancing teacher 
capacity, morale, commitment, status and income so as to ensure a rights-based, child-
friendly school environment that promotes effective learning.52 As previously mentioned,

<p>the UNESCO-ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers (1966) provides the 
most comprehensive guidance to secure adequate working conditions for teachers. 
Adequate salaries are essential to ensuring that the teaching profession becomes more 
attractive. Better emoluments can increase teachers&#8223; readiness to accept deployment in rural 
and remote areas. National laws can contribute to improving salary scales. In Ecuador, for 
instance, teachers&#8223; salaries were doubled after the adoption the Law on Intercultural 
Education (2008).  
</p>
<p><b>  Teaching methods 
</b></p>
<p>66. Quality of education depends on the dynamics of the teaching/learning process, 
including the use of instructional manuals and the teacher&#8223;s pedagogical skills. New 
pedagogical approaches which are child-friendly as well as inspiring and motivating are 
necessary. Teachers need to be able to motivate students, develop their critical thinking, 
and nurture moral values.  
</p>
<p>67. Assessing the pedagogical performance of teachers and establishing objective 
criteria in this regard is particularly challenging. States have taken some measures, 
including producing guidelines or codes of conduct53 for teachers, ranging from  prohibiting 
certain behaviour to expressing expectations of professional conduct. Portugal&#8223;s teacher 
evaluation model, which assesses the pedagogical performance of teachers and their 
contribution to fulfilling the school&#8223;s mission, including the pedagogical relationship with 
pupils, can serve as an example.54 In Ontario, Canada, a regulation pursuant to the 
Education Act requires teachers to demonstrate commitment to advance pupils&#8223; learning 
and achievement, as well as to their well-being and development.55 Other measures, such as 
prohibiting private tuitions and taking disciplinary action in case of teacher absenteeism, 
may also be covered under codes of conduct.   
</p>
<p><b> D. National curriculum content and standards 
</b></p>
<p>68. Laws and policies in many countries require the national curriculum to establish 
common core competencies with uniform standards countrywide. Ministries of education 
and other national education authorities often frame the national curriculum according to 
which pedagogical materials for schools are developed.56 In the Republic of Korea, for 
example, the Elementary and Secondary Act provides for the Minister of Education, 
Science and Technology to determine the basic matters concerning the standards and 
contents of the common curriculum, and schools are required to use textbooks approved 
and authorized by the Ministry. In Russia, the Education Law (amended in 2005) stipulates 
a mandatory minimum content for basic education syllabi, and provides for a &#8220;single State 
educational standard&#8221; (arts. 7 and 9), as does the National Basic Curriculum in Guatemala. 
In Australia, all pupils should be taught on the basis of agreed curriculum content,

<p>regardless of their circumstances, the type of school they attend or the school location.57 In 
France, a national education programme set by the State is mandatory for both public and 
private schools, while in Mauritius, the guidelines for curriculum development are set out in 
the document entitled &#8220;Towards a Quality Curriculum: Strategy for Reform,&#8221; of  September 
</p><p>2006.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Evaluation of learning achievements 
</b></p>
<p>69. The assessment of students&#8223; performance and achievements provides an important 
indicator of the quality of education. According to the EFA Global Monitoring Report 
2008, most governments have focused on measuring academic knowledge (sciences, 
languages, maths), literacy and numeracy through regular State examinations and 
international assessments.58 National learning assessments may include monitoring of 
subject-specific achievements; standards-based assessments according to grade or age; 
school-based assessments of pupil progress, based on tests or performance;59 and external 
public examinations at major system transition points, such as from primary to secondary 
education or end of secondary education.60 International assessments of students&#8223; 
achievements or basic skills are also widely used.61 
</p>
<p>70. The EFA Global Monitoring Report 2005 notes that many approaches in the 
economic tradition have assumed that there is a workable analogy between schools and 
factories, in the sense that a set of inputs to schooling is transformed by teachers and pupils 
into a set of outputs in a fairly uniform way. However, attempts to assess the extent to 
which changing the mix of inputs affects the outputs, so as to identify the most cost-
effective policy levers for quality improvement, have often proved inconclusive.62  Human 
rights cannot be subjected to a cost-benefit analysis. Provision of the right to quality basic 
education, free of cost for all, is a core obligation of States and should not be compromised 
at any cost. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur considers it preferable to use the terms &#8220;assessment&#8221; or 
&#8220;performance evaluation,&#8221; which are also referred to in national legislations and policies in 
many countries, rather than &#8220;input-output&#8221; model. Notably, the OECD-PISA is a system of 
assessment of students&#8223; performance. 
</p>
<p><b>  National Assessments 
</b></p>
<p>72. In Mexico, the National Evaluation of Scholastic Achievements in Schools 
(ENLACE) tests the competences and academic achievements of students in basic 
education nationwide. In Germany, the Standing Conference of Ministers of Education and 
Cultural Affairs adopted a comprehensive strategy for education monitoring, including 
</p>

<p>evaluation of lifelong learning achievements. In this context, it was also recognized that 
assessments on the effectiveness of teaching and learning in the classroom must be made in 
parallel to the measurement of student achievements.  
</p>
<p>73. In Brazil, the Education Development Plan (2011) establishes links between 
&#8220;quality, equity and empowerment&#8221;63 and provides a quality indicator for assessing student 
performance. In Serbia, achievement standards are a set of education results for each level, 
cycle, type of education, educational profile, grade, subject and module. In Honduras, the 
Social Pact for Quality Education, launched within the ambit of the Law to Strengthen 
Public Education and Community Participation, includes strategic initiatives for improving 
academic performance with time-bound targets.64 In Mauritius, the Education and Human 
Resources Strategy Plan (2008-2020) includes the development of a national assessment 
initiative. In Slovenia, the Council for Quality and Evaluation (2008) is responsible for 
assessing students&#8223; progression in basic and general secondary education through national 
examinations and certification. In Cyprus, the Centre for Educational Research and 
Evaluation (2008) monitors progress and assures quality in education. 
</p>
<p>74. Assessment of students&#8223; performance must be comprehensive in looking into quality 
in all fields of education, including, a priori, knowledge and understanding of human rights 
principles and values; competencies and skills in technical and vocational education and 
training; as well as knowledge and skills in mathematical and scientific literacy and 
languages.   
</p>
<p><b>  Evaluations for the transition to a different level of schooling  
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur considers it crucial to monitor and assess students&#8223; learning 
achievements on a regular basis, with a rigorous performance evaluation prior to transition 
from primary to secondary education. Automatic promotion to the next grade, irrespective 
of students&#8223; learning achievements, can perpetuate, even aggravate, the poor quality of 
education.  
</p>
<p>76. Most countries have well established systems for periodic assessment of students 
transitioning to another level of schooling:   
</p>
<p>&#8226; In France, pupils&#8223; reading competencies are evaluated every five years. At every 
</p>
<p>grade in the primary and junior secondary (coll&#232;ge) levels a continuous system of 
evaluation of the common knowledge base and competences established by the 
official curriculum is applied ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Egypt, Ministerial Decrees No. 255 (2005) and No. 278 (2007)65 establish a 
comprehensive evaluation of four grades of basic education; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Guyana, the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) administers a national 
assessment at Grade 9, and another assessment at the end of the secondary cycle 
(Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In India, year-end examinations have been replaced with a Comprehensive and 
Continuous Evaluation (CCE) system.

<p>&#8226; In the Republic of Korea, the National Assessment for Educational Achievement 
(NAEA) is conducted for grades 6, 9 (3rd year of middle school), and 11 (2nd year 
of high school).  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Nigeria, a National Assessment of Learning Achievements in Basic Education 
(NALABE) is conducted every three years. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Qatar, the Supreme Education Council conducts annual student evaluations from 
grades 4 to 12.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Participatory school management and respect for human rights 
</b></p>
<p>77. Management plays a central role in ensuring schools remain inclusive and safe 
environments, free from violence and sexual harassment, and work in tandem with the 
community. Rules and regulations governing school management should ensure that the 
community, parents, teachers and pupils have a voice and role in the management of 
schools, and in finding ways and means to improve the quality of the school environment. 
This is acknowledged in the UNESCO-ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of 
Teachers (1966), which specifies that there should be close cooperation between the 
competent authorities, organizations of teachers, employers and workers, and parents, as 
well as cultural organizations and institutions of learning and research, for the purpose of 
defining educational policy and its objectives (para. 10 (k)). 
</p>
<p>78. &#8220;Education systems that lack a strong, clear respect for human rights cannot be said 
to be of high quality.&#8221;66 In order to nurture quality education, school environments must 
respect and promote human rights and mutual understanding.67 Schools can play a central 
role in the prevention of violence and the promotion of a culture of peace as long as internal 
practices are guided by strict adherence to human rights principles. Quality education can 
never be ensured if school systems ignore situations of gender inequality or discrimination 
against particular groups on ethnic or cultural grounds. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Monitoring and inspecting schools  
</b></p>
<p>79. Regardless of the type of standard imposed, States need to implement a monitoring 
system that examines and measures compliance and progress. As indicated by one 
UNESCO study, &#8220;the number of countries that initiate a process of reorganizing and 
strengthening supervision services is increasing every year.&#8221;68 In many countries, national 
institutions are entrusted with the implementation of monitoring standards, including the 
Institute for Quality Development in the Education System (Germany);  the State Service of 
Quality Education (Latvia); the Institute for Educational Evaluation and Learning 
Assessments (Mexico); the Qualifications Authority for Technical and Vocational 
Education (Mauritius); the Education Standards Agency (Uganda); and the Office for 
Standards in Education (OFSTED) (United Kingdom), to mention but a few examples. 
</p>
<p>  
 66  EFA Global Monitoring Report 2005, pp. 223-224. 
 67  Many countries, for example, Austria, France, Italy and Morocco, attach importance to imparting 
</p>
<p>human rights values through education. In Uruguay, all education establishments must construct 
learning space for collective knowledge, socialization and integration and for promoting human 
rights. 
</p>
<p> 68  &#8220;Reforming school supervision for quality improvement, Module 1, Supervision: a key component of 
a quality monitoring system,&#8221; International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO, 2007. </p>


<p>80. Public authorities should ensure monitoring and accountability in all situations 
where standards are not met. If standards are to be effectively implemented, the concerned 
stakeholders, including teaching personnel, parents and pupils, must be aware of them and 
actively involved in compliance.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>81. Prevalent teacher absenteeism bears evidence to the slackness regarding the 
inspection of schools. Public authorities should tighten monitoring and inspection in order 
to control this lacuna with disciplinary measures. Some additional aspects deserve special 
consideration in quality inspections, such as: (i) the way human rights values are promoted 
in schools; (ii) the overall interaction with parents and the community; (iii) the promotion 
of dialogue with teachers on child-friendly teaching and learning. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Challenges in implementing norms and standards for quality 
in education 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Promoting quality in education and ensuring equality of opportunities  
</b></p>
<p>82. Quality in education is inextricably linked with equality of opportunities. Challenges 
are huge in this regard, as overall socio-economic inequalities between rich and poor are 
rampant, both within and among countries. These inequalities are reflected in persistent 
quality disparities in education provided to different segments of the population. Thus, one 
of the main objectives of education systems should be &#8220;to ensure quality education, with 
equal opportunities,&#8221; as affirmed by the National Education Law in Argentina.69 
</p>
<p>83. Quality education will remain elusive so long as education systems practise 
marginalization and exclusion. Bringing about de facto equality of opportunity in education 
necessitates an equity-based approach to education. Through education laws and policy, 
States need to give particular consideration to the educational needs of economically and 
socially marginalized groups, such as those living in poverty, ethnic and linguistic 
minorities, children with disabilities and indigenous children. In this regard, Human Rights 
Council resolution 17/3 urges States to give full effect to the right to education by ensuring 
adequate legal protection and addressing multiple forms of inequality and discrimination in 
education through comprehensive policies. An example of an inclusive approach is 
provided by Spain&#8223;s Organic Education Law (2006), which centers around the fundamental 
principle of quality of education for all students, combined with equity and equal 
opportunities.70 
</p>
<p>84. In this context, attention must be paid to ensure that the adoption of quality 
standards for education does not further penalize schools in poorer and marginalized 
neighbourhoods. National or international assessment of students&#8223; performance, for 
example, should not adversely affect the fate of students and schools in marginalized 
pockets of society.71 Some ranking exercises might result in favouring well-served schools 
in wealthier areas and reinforcing stigmatization of schools in poorer areas. Such exercises 
</p>
<p>  
 69  Law No. 26.206 (art. 11). 
 70  See <i>A Quality Education for All and Shared by All</i>, Spain, Ministry of Education and Science, 2004.  
 71  In the United States of America, under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, schools are judged on 
</p>
<p>whether they make adequate yearly progress (AYP) according to results of standardized tests in key 
subjects such as reading and language, arts, maths. Each state then publishes this information for 
parents and other interested stakeholders, on a school-by-school and district-by-district basis.  </p>


<p>might also cause schools to reject underperforming children72 and further exacerbate 
marginalization. Provisions in the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in 
Education are highly pertinent in this respect. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Enhancing national investment for quality education 
</b></p>
<p>85. In many developing countries, budgetary provision for the improvement of quality 
in education is low, as the quasi-totality of the education budget is dedicated to regular 
maintenance costs and salaries. Quality is particularly undermined by the fact that 
investment in essential areas, such as development of pedagogic materials and school 
facilities, remains neglected. Provision of adequate resources for education is essential to 
the fulfilment of State obligations to ensure quality education. As the Special Rapporteur 
stated in his report to the General Assembly (A/66/269), a paradigm shift is required in 
public expenditure on education to respond to quality imperatives. Quality education 
targets, based on benchmarks in terms of class-size, teacher-student ratio, text books, 
school building and amenities, as well as deployment of qualified and trained teachers, can 
provide a basis for determining financial requirements. States must also ensure that the 
allocation of resources among schools is fair and equitable, and that schools in marginalized 
and remote areas receive added support to enable them to become better performing.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Regulating private providers of education  
</b></p>
<p>86. Exploding demands for education have led to an exponential growth in the number 
of private schools, which need to be regulated. Quality norms and standards should be 
uniformly applicable to all schools &#8211; public and private alike &#8211; throughout a country.73 A 
comprehensive and sound regulatory framework for controlling private schools and 
ensuring their conformity with norms and standards is required.74 Effective sanctions in 
case of abusive practices by private schools are necessary.75 As the International 
Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century stated, policy-makers must &#8220;face up 
squarely to their responsibilities&#8221; and not leave it to market forces or some kind of self-
regulation to put things right when they go wrong.76 In this respect, it is pertinent to bear in 
mind that as regards parental choice in education in schools other than those established by 
the public authorities, this must &#8220;conform to such minimum educational standards as may 
be laid down or approved by the State.&#8221;77 
</p>

<p><b>individual empowerment. Thus, considerations on the quality of education should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>central to reflections on the steps to be taken in the post-EFA phase, with a focus on 
</b></p>
<p><b>innovative and equitable education systems. In this process, a holistic conceptual 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework for quality, already outlined, must be embraced. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Widespread concerns on quality in education call for strengthening national 
legal frameworks with a view to establishing and reinforcing standards for quality in 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. To that end, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Develop and strengthen national legal and policy frameworks for quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>education: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States have the primary obligation to ensure the right to quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. As such, they should accord high priority to the development 
</b></p>
<p><b>and strengthening of education laws and policies aimed at ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality education for all, paying foremost attention to the empowering 
</b></p>
<p><b>role of the right to education;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should ensure that all public authorities responsible for designing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementing education policies at local and national levels conform 
</b></p>
<p><b>to quality norms and standards;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>National human rights institutions, where they exist, as well as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary, are vital to monitoring initiatives in this regard and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>safeguarding the quality of education;   
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Parliamentarians also play an important role in promoting national 
</b></p>
<p><b>debates on quality in education, developing legal frameworks and 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring State practices; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Adopt norms and standards for quality for the entire education system: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States must ensure that norms and standards for quality education are 
</b></p>
<p><b>uniformly applied in the country and cover the entire education system. 
</b></p>
<p><b>No field or discipline of education should be neglected in this process. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be ensured that norms are in line with human rights principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that all schools, whether public or private, function in conformity 
</b></p>
<p><b>with such norms and standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Implement quality assessments with a promotional spirit:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Quality assessments should be driven by a promotional spirit, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasis on creating equitable educational and learning opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all, rather than further marginalizing poorly endowed schools in 
</b></p>
<p><b>remote areas. Based on the findings of national-level assessments of 
</b></p>
<p>students&#8217; performance, States should support those regions and schools 
</p>
<p><b>which perform poorly and are falling behind, in an endeavor to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>more equitable education systems. Affirmative action and positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures should be stepped up to enable all those who are victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>social exclusion and poverty to enjoy their right to quality education;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) </b>Improve teacher&#8217;s qualification and working conditions<b>:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should develop a comprehensive normative framework for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>teaching profession, applicable to both public and private schools. In 
</b></p>
<p>recognition of teachers&#8217; key role in providing quality education, this 
</p>
<p><b>should contain norms for the qualification of teachers, their status and </b></p>


<p><b>career development, while providing incentives to make the teaching 
</b></p>
<p><b>profession more attractive and valued;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure financial resources for quality education: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promoting quality education is a permanent challenge, and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment therein should be a priority. States should ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary resources for the fulfillment of their obligation to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality education. States could, as a matter of norm, set aside at least 20-
</b></p>
<p><b>25 per cent of national budget allocations to education for improving 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality in education, over and above the recurring expenditure on 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. States should also devise necessary policies aimed at resource 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobilization for quality, when regional and local bodies are responsible 
</b></p>
<p><b>for basic education;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Focus o</b>n the right to quality education for women&#8217;s empowerment<b>: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States should pay particular attention to the quality of education offered 
</b></p>
<p><b>to girls and women. Emphasis should be placed on giving concrete shape 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the provisions laid down in the Convention on Elimination of All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forms of Discrimination against Women;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Enhance international technical assistance to Governments: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>International entities, such as UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Bank, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be encouraged to continue their work in providing policy advice, 
</b></p>
<p><b>support services and technical assistance to Governments in their efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>to respond to quality imperatives. UNESCO could develop guidelines for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the establishment of standards for quality education; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Encourage further debate in international human rights bodies: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>In view of the crucial role of quality education in nation-building, 
</b></p>
<p><b>further debate on the right to quality education at the global level must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be encouraged. The organization of a thematic discussion under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>auspices of the Human Rights Council could go a long way in giving 
</b></p>
<p><b>impetus to national action for achieving quality education; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The United Nations human rights treaty bodies </b>&#8211;<b> in particular the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women </b>&#8211;<b> should pay enhanced attention to 
</b></p>
<p><b>quality in education in order to further emphasize State obligations in 
</b></p>
<p><b>this regard; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Support research and reflection on quality in education:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Further research and reflections on the requirements for quality in 
</b></p>
<p><b>education should be promoted by universities and education research 
</b></p>
<p><b>centres. Civil society organizations should also contribute to this process 
</b></p>
<p><b>by monitoring the situation of education and promoting initiatives that 
</b></p>
<p><b>foster quality in education. 
</b></p>
