<p><i>Summary

</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, on behalf of the Secretary-General, pursuant to Human 
Rights Council resolution 22/17, adopted on 21 March 2013, in which the Council 
requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council at its twenty-fifth session on the 
implementation of the resolution. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/17, 
adopted on 21 March 2013, in which the Council called upon Israel, the occupying Power, 
to comply with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and 
the Human Rights Council. The Human Rights Council recalled in particular Security 
Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Security Council decided, inter alia, that the 
decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian 
Golan was null and void and without international legal effect and demanded that Israel 
rescind forthwith its decision. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council also requested the Secretary-General to bring resolution 
22/17 to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized 
agencies, international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international 
humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report thereon to 
the Council at its twenty-fifth session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 22/17 
</b>3. On 30 September 2013, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note verbale to 
the Government of Israel referring to Human Rights Council resolution 22/17, requesting 
information on any steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of 
the said resolution. No reply was received.  
</p>
<p>4. On the same day, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note 
verbale to all permanent missions in Geneva to draw their attention to resolution 22/17 and 
to request the Governments of member States to provide information on any steps taken or 
envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of the relevant provisions of the 
resolution. The Permanent Missions of the Syrian Arab Republic, of Ireland and of Cuba 
responded by means of notes verbales to that request. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, brought resolution 22/17 
to the attention of the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international 
and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, 
pursuant to the request of the Council set out in the resolution. The Permanent Delegation 
of the European Union responded by means of a note verbale. 
</p>
<p>6. In its note verbale dated 30 October 2013, the Syrian Arab Republic referred to the 
occupation of the Syrian Golan in 1967, resulting in the displacement of more than 500,000 
Syrians from their homes to other parts of the Syrian territory and the destruction of their 
villages and farms. According to the Syrian Arab Republic, for more than four decades, 
Israel, the occupying Power, has tried to uproot the remaining Syrian population of the 
occupied Golan through systematic violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War (1949). Furthermore, the Syrian Arab Republic referred to 
the illegal decision taken by Israel in 1981 to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan and to a series of United Nations resolutions 
calling upon all Member States to reject any legislative and administrative measures taken 
by Israel, the occupying Power, based on the above-mentioned decision. The Syrian Arab 
Republic further mentioned that Israel continued to disparage all these resolutions and to 
reject their international legitimacy. 
</p><p>7. In its response, the Syrian Arab Republic referred to the architectural and 
demographic changes, land confiscation, and encouragement of thousands of Israeli settlers </p>


<p>to move to the occupied Syrian Golan that have been carried out by Israel, the occupying 
Power, in violation of international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva 
Convention. According to the Syrian Arab Republic, Israel has continued to allocate 
confiscated Syrian-owned land to Israeli settlers and to provide them with assistance, 
including funds and licences to build settlements, farms, factories and tourist resorts. In its 
note verbale, the Syrian Arab Republic adds that products produced in the occupied Syrian 
Golan are misleadingly exported as Israeli products, in violation of relevant United Nations 
resolutions. 
</p>
<p>8. The Syrian Arab Republic condemned in the strongest terms the decision of the 
Israeli Knesset on 2 November 2010 to carry out a survey prior to the withdrawal of Israel 
from the occupied Syrian Golan and East Jerusalem, requesting 80 per cent of votes in 
favour. According to the Syrian Arab Republic, this constitutes a gross violation of 
international law and a new disparagement of the resolutions related to the occupied 
Syrian Golan adopted by the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human 
Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>9. According to the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, the occupying Power 
obliged the Syrian population of the occupied Golan to hold Israeli identity documents for 
assimilation purposes and in order to break the remaining link between the occupied Syrian 
Golan and the Syrian motherland. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic also stated 
that Israel denied access to education, health and other essential services to those who did 
not possess such documents and mentioned that protests against these measures took place, 
with protestors burning Israeli identity documents. Many were reportedly arrested, unfairly 
sentenced and imprisoned for long periods, including in several cases for over 27 years. 
</p>
<p>10. The Syrian Arab Republic condemned in the strongest terms the brutal and 
inhumane treatment, including torture, to which Syrian prisoners are subjected in Israeli 
prisons. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reports that several prisoners have 
developed chronic diseases, particularly cancer, and that Israel, the occupying Power, 
would deny them treatment until the last stages of their illness and release prisoners in the 
last days of their lives, in order not to be held responsible for their deaths. In this regard, the 
Syrian Arab Republic noted that Israel rejected its repeated requests for the United Nations 
and the International Committee of the Red Cross to intervene to prevent the suffering of 
those prisoners<b> </b>of conscience, as well as offers to treat the sick, including at the expense of 
the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. It was also mentioned that the occupying 
Power had disregarded the repeated calls of the Human Rights Council to release the 
prisoners. The Syrian Arab Republic further reiterated its call upon the United Nations to 
intervene to release the prisoners and to allow them to enjoy their right to freedom of 
opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>11. In its note verbale, the Syrian Arab Republic also states that the Israeli occupying 
authorities prevented Syrian nationals from moving between the Syrian Arab Republic and 
the occupied Syrian Golan, including through the Quneitra crossing, noting that the 
international community had condemned those unlawful restrictions on the freedom of 
movement of Syrians between the two parts of their country. The Syrian Arab Republic 
further referred to the situation of students from the occupied Syrian Golan who had been 
offered education opportunities by their Government and faced arrest by Israel every time 
they returned to their homes during holidays. Those who had completed their studies were 
reportedly subject to further restrictions and prevented from practising their professions, 
such as medicine, including opening medical centres in the occupied Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>12. According to the Syrian Arab Republic, the practices of the Israeli occupying 
authorities have negatively impacted livelihoods. The Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic reported that Israel prevented water for drinking and agriculture from reaching the 
Syrian population of the occupied Golan and that Israeli settlers continued to receive more </p>


<p>water than the Syrian population to the detriment of Syrian agricultural production. 
According to the Syrian Arab Republic, even if Syrian farmers manage to cultivate their 
land, they face difficulties in marketing their products. In an effort to help these farmers, 
the Government, in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, has 
facilitated the trade of apples of the occupied Syrian Golan in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>13. The Syrian Arab Republic concluded by condemning the violations of civil and 
political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights affecting the Syrian 
population of the occupied Golan and recalled that the occupied Syrian Golan was an 
integral part of Syrian territory.  
</p>
<p>14. The Permanent Mission of Ireland, in its note verbale dated 7 October 2013, stressed 
that its Government did not recognize any of the legislative or administrative measures 
referred to in Human Rights Council resolution 22/17 which purport to apply in the 
occupied Syrian Golan. 
</p>
<p>15. On 15 November 2013, the Permanent Mission of Cuba sent a note verbale 
expressing full support for resolution 22/17 and calling for its prompt and strict 
implementation by all member States. 
</p>
<p>16. Cuba strongly condemned the &#8220;brutal&#8221; practices against Syrians held in Israeli 
prisons and further reiterated its serious concern about the inhumane conditions of 
detention of Syrians, which had a negative impact on their physical health, putting their 
lives in danger in clear violation of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>17. Cuba also mentioned that 120 member States of the Non-Aligned Movement had 
expressed unconditional support and solidarity with the legitimate demand of the Syrian 
Arab Republic to fulfil its sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan, based on the Arab 
peace initiative and the Madrid peace process, as well as the principle of land for peace, in 
conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions. According to Cuba, the ongoing 
occupation of the Syrian Golan and its de facto annexation constitutes an obstacle to 
achieving fair, comprehensive and long-lasting peace in the region. 
</p>
<p>18. Cuba reiterated that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by 
Israel in the last 46 years were null and without juridical validity. Cuba also referred to 
attempts by Israel to modify the legal status, physical characteristics, demographic 
composition and institutional structure of the occupied Syrian Golan.  
</p>
<p>19. Cuba reaffirmed its view that the decision taken by Israel on 14 December 1981 in 
this regard and its illegal activities of construction and expansion of settlements since 1967, 
constituted a blatant violation of international humanitarian law, including the Fourth 
Geneva Convention, the Charter of the United Nations and Security Council resolution 497 
(1981). Furthermore, Cuba mentioned that the confiscation of territories was non-
admissible by virtue of international law. It demanded that Israel fulfil immediately and 
unconditionally its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention and all relevant United 
Nations resolutions pertaining to the occupied Syrian Golan. 
</p>
<p>20. In addition, Cuba called upon Israel to withdraw immediately from the Syrian Golan 
to the lines that existed on 4 June 1967, in compliance with Security Council resolutions 
242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Cuba further noted that Israel should renounce its unrestrained 
attempts to take over the occupied Syrian Golan. It concluded by noting that foreign 
occupation, policies of expansion and aggression, the creation of settlements and of <i>fait 
accompli</i> on the ground and the forcible annexation of territories, are practices that violate 
international instruments and norms.  </p>


<p>21. In its response dated 24 October 2013, the Permanent Delegation of the European 
Union referred to the conclusions of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council on the 
Middle East peace process of 10 December 2012, in which the Council expressed its 
commitment to ensuring that all agreements between the State of Israel and the European 
Union must &#8211; in line with international law &#8211; unequivocally and explicitly indicate their 
inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the occupied Syrian 
Golan.1 In its note verbale, the European Union stated that this decision was in line with its 
long-standing position not to recognize the sovereignty of Israel over the occupied 
territories or consider them to be part of Israeli territory.
