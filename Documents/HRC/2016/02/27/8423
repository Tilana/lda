<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/29, the Human Rights Council decided to dedicate, at a minimum, 
an annual full-day meeting to discuss different specific themes on the rights of the child, 
including the identification of challenges in the realization of the rights of the child. In its 
resolution 13/20, the Council decided to focus its next resolution and annual full-day 
meeting on a holistic approach for the protection and promotion of the rights of children 
working and/or living on the street.  
</p>
<p>2. The annual full-day meeting on the protection and promotion of the rights of 
children working and/or living on the street was held on 9 March 2011, and was aimed at 
raising awareness about the situation faced by children living and/or working on the street, 
reaffirming existing standards and commitments undertaken by Member States to protect 
children, including those in particularly difficult situations, highlighting good practices and 
lessons learned from work conducted by different actors, as well as identifying key 
challenges and recommending a way forward. The meeting comprised two panels: the 
morning panel focused on the root causes and factors leading children to live and/or work 
on the street, while the afternoon panel was devoted to discussing prevention strategies and 
responses.  
</p>
<p>3. The meeting was also attended by representatives of the African Movement of 
Working Children and Youth as well as of programmes supported by Plan International in 
Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>4. The meeting was jointly organized by the Permanent Mission of Hungary and the 
Delegation of the European Union (on behalf of the European Union), Uruguay (on behalf 
of the Latin American and Caribbean Group) and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, with other United Nations agencies, particularly the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), and non-governmental organizations, including the Street Children Consortium and 
the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Plan International. A 
task force for the preparation of the annual full-day meeting initiated its discussions in 
November 2010 and met regularly to ensure a successful outcome of the event.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Morning panel: &#8220;Root causes and factors leading children to 
live and work on the street&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks and statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>5. The morning panel was moderated by the President of the Human Rights Council. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the panel, followed by 
presentations by youth representatives of programmes supported by Plan International in 
Bangladesh; a representative of the African Movement of Working Children and Youth 
from Benin; the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography; the President of Street Invest; and the Commissioner and Rapporteur on 
Children of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>6. In her opening statement, the High Commissioner stated that the Human Rights 
Council had rightly chosen the theme of children living and/or working on the streets and 
welcomed the chosen focus on the root causes and factors that led children to the insecurity 
and violence that they routinely encountered in the streets. Children did not belong in the 
streets; they belonged in safe environments at school and at home. Prevention could not be </p>


<p>effective without a deep understanding of the root causes of this alarming phenomenon; an 
understanding of the phenomenon alone would remain moot in the absence of a 
commitment to address and mitigate the situation of the estimated 100 million street 
children.  The High Commissioner added that children in street situations were to be found 
everywhere, and stated that it was a shameful situation that affected the developing and 
developed world alike.  
</p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner explained that children living and/or working on the street 
were particularly vulnerable to human rights violations, including sexual exploitation and 
abuse, violence and trafficking. In addition to violence, discrimination and stigma, children 
in street situations also lacked basic rights, such as access to education, health care, food 
and adequate living conditions. They could be easily subjected to exploitative work, drugs 
and harsh punishment for small offences. They faced serious health problems, including 
HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The international community had to protect 
children in street situations, and at a minimum ensure that they are not subjected to 
punishment by laws penalizing survival behaviours, such as begging, vagrancy, truancy and 
running away.  She also emphasized that children living and/or working in the street should 
not be seen as a social problem, but as human beings with a full potential to contribute to 
society and as agents for change.  
</p>
<p>8. The youth representatives from programmes supported by Plan International, in 
Bangladesh (Tania, aged 14, and Riaz, aged 16) stated that they had grown up living and 
working on the streets. Sometimes children lived on the streets because they were poor and 
their family situation was not good, sometimes facing domestic violence. They added that 
there were many children around the world who, for different reasons, were forced to spend 
their childhood on the streets, without the love and affection of their parents or without 
opportunities to attend school and live decent lives. Long-term solutions were needed for 
helping such children. If everyone in society cooperated, children in the streets could grow 
up with confidence like other children and become successful. 
</p>
<p>9. The representative of the African Movement of Working Children and Youth 
(Severine, aged 17), from Benin, stated that many children lived in very difficult situations, 
including working for other people, being taken out of school or being abandoned by 
parents owing to poverty. They lived from begging, prostitution or stealing, had no shelter, 
slept on streets or in market places, were persecuted by the police and often imprisoned. It 
was an obligation of the State and of parents to send children to school; older children 
needed support in order to get training and education to earn their living. States should 
create professional training centres and schools, especially in remote areas, to better protect 
the girl-child, provide free health care to children and use resources to promote and protect 
the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, Najat Maala M&#8217;jid, drew a distinction between &#8220;street children&#8221; and &#8220;children 
in the street&#8221;; the first term referred to children who lived all the time in the street and had 
no contact with their  family, while the second referred to children who maintained some 
contact with the family. However, the distinction between the two was not always clear and 
there were a variety of situations depending on age, sex, how children survived in the street 
and if they both lived and worked in the street or only worked there. She emphasized the 
specific vulnerability of girls to sexual exploitation and early pregnancy. She stressed that 
each child was unique, and that solutions had to be tailored to each particular case. She 
analysed the different contexts that made a child live and work on the streets: family 
situations; social and cultural factors, including the persistence of certain harmful practices, 
such as early or forced marriage; socio-economic difficulties; as well as institutional 
factors. She cited the difficulties arising from the phenomenon of children&#8217;s gangs and the 
lack of access to social alternatives, opportunities and employment.  </p>


<p>11. The Special Rapporteur emphasized that, to prevent this multidimensional and 
complex phenomenon, the international community had to take all the factors mentioned 
into account. It was important that children had access to protection mechanisms. It was 
also important that monitoring institutions be established and to ensure easy access for the 
most vulnerable children to child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting 
mechanisms. Effective prevention and action in the best interest of the child required a deep 
understanding of the different situations and risk factors facing children.   
</p>
<p>12. The President of Street Invest, Father Patrick Shanahan, explained that, in 1994, he 
carried out a straw poll among 100 youths living in the street in Accra, and asked them 
what they would do if they were given everything to leave the street tomorrow, such as  
paid school fees, desk fee, chair fee, book costs, event board and lodging, and whether they 
would leave. Two out of 100 said yes. One boy asked &#8220;School? What for? To wear a 
uniform for six years and end up back on the street?&#8221;  Father Shanahan explained that need 
street children had to be observed from their perspective, not from ours. He advised against 
attempting to impose solutions on street children that would not be relevant or useful for 
their lives, and that the reality of street children had to be dealt with as the children were, 
rather than what we wanted them to be. Children should be heeded first to evaluate what 
was in their best interest, and appropriate actions would follow from there.   
</p>
<p>13. Children were on the streets; in order to find a development plan for them, workers 
should go to the streets to understand them. Father Shanahan quoted Benno Glauser, a 
tireless Swiss worker for street children: &#8220;Might growing up in the street, rather than just 
being a negative experience for children, also show new and potentially positive ways or 
even provide a new paradigm, for children growing up in disintegrating societies?&#8221; Street 
children had a right to live on the street and to have an adult that they trust. He urged one 
Government to volunteer to start a policy to accept a street child&#8217;s right to be on the street 
and to promote the role of the street worker in reconceptualizing the development of the 
street child. 
</p>
<p>14. The Commissioner and Rapporteur on Children of the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, stated that street children in the Americas were 
among the main victims of violence in the world. Poverty was the main cause of this 
phenomenon and street children were often running away from violence, abuse and neglect 
suffered at home. States should provide special protection for children, especially street 
children. For many children in the street, however, the State was not a protector but the 
main perpetrator of violence, by commission or omission. Street children were often 
labelled as criminal gang members that should be taken off the streets for the sake of 
security. Such systematic repressive responses from States compromised international 
human rights standards, besides being ineffective and costly.  
</p>
<p>15. The Rapporteur stated that, in the past two decades, despite the efforts of some 
Governments to effectively protect the rights of street children, effective plans and a lack of 
services aimed at getting children off the streets had been absent. Despite their visibility, 
street children had more often served as the tragic illustration of neglect and vulnerability 
than as targets for positive programmes, policies and services. He emphasized that children 
on the streets had to be protected from State and other violence, and that the best way to 
deal with violence against children was to stop it before it happened. Freedom from all 
forms of violence, including corporal punishment, was the right of all children. In 2009, the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights published a report, in which it stated that 
corporal punishment was a violation of human rights and that it was an obligation of all 
States to prohibit all forms of violence against children, in all contexts, wherever it might 
occur. That required investing into prevention programmes to address the underlying causes 
and establishing a strong legal framework not only grounded on sanctions, but also aimed at </p>


<p>sending a robust, unequivocal signal that society would not tolerate violence against 
children. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>16. The<b> </b>Human Rights<b> </b>Council divided the first panel discussion into two segments. 
During the first segment, statements were made by the European Union, Belgium, Chile, 
Cuba, Ecuador, Germany, Guatemala, Nigeria (on behalf of the Group of African States), 
Pakistan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Uruguay (on behalf 
of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States). The Ukrainian Parliamentary 
Commissioner, the Foundation ECPAT International1 and the International Save the 
Children Alliance2 also made statements. The representatives of Argentina, Bangladesh, 
Brazil, China, Djibouti, Finland, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Malaysia, Saudi 
Arabia, Slovenia, Turkey, World Vision International3 and International Movement ATD 
Fourth World4 spoke during the second segment. 
</p>
<p>17. During the interactive dialogue, speakers welcomed the presence of youth 
representatives as panellists and the opportunity to listen to them, giving due weight to their 
views as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. States reaffirmed the 
importance of the Convention and its Optional Protocols, and calls were made the 
ratification of these international instruments. Representatives of different Governments 
strongly condemned the violence experienced by street children, including sexual 
exploitation and abuse, trafficking, hazardous work, discrimination and lack of access to 
basic services. In the light of the lack of comprehensive data, which constituted a serious 
global omission, calls were made by some States to develop, strengthen and implement the 
systematic collection of disaggregated national data on street children so that effective 
measures for prevention and intervention could be made.  
</p>
<p>18. Extensive reference to the root causes of the phenomenon was also made, including 
poverty and economic hardships, family disintegration, exclusion, stigmatization and lack 
of education, as well as domestic violence, urbanization and natural and man-made 
disasters. The particular situation of unaccompanied foreign children was also raised during 
the dialogue. Speakers agreed that this was a phenomenon found in developed and 
developing countries alike, and that girls were extremely vulnerable to exploitation and 
abuse. Children in the street were seen as a threat to society rather than as holders of human 
rights. Some speakers noted the increased risk for these children of being recruited by 
armed groups, but also for demobilized child soldiers to end up living on the street. The 
responsibility of States to ensure that all children could live with their families, go to school 
and have access to the most basic services was emphasized.

</p>

Council of Women. </p>


<p>19. There was a special reference on prevention and education measures, as well as to 
the respect for the views of the child and the importance of integrating him/her in decision 
making process which concern them. The promotion and protection of the rights of the 
child were not only an international obligation but also an indispensable investment to 
secure our future, speakers said. Integrated cross-sectoral policies, national plan of actions 
as well as cooperation at the national, regional and international level were important to 
protect the rights of children living and working on the street. Speakers expressed concern 
at many children working in the street and they were convinced that the protection of 
children had to be put at the top of political agendas and public policies. Some States said 
that their Governments had adopted strategies, including necessary legislative measures to 
ensure that street children continued to enjoy their right to education. A number of 
countries also informed the Human Rights Council about the steps taken at the national 
level with regard to the protection of children.  
</p>
<p>20. Non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions stated that a 
staggering number of children living and working on the street had lost one or both parents. 
Children affected by HIV/AIDS suffered from extreme isolation and discrimination. 
Preventive and protection actions were critical to guarantee the rights of children living or 
working on the street and those affected or infected by HIV/AIDS and to ensure their well-
being and security. Speakers urged that steps be taken as part of the obligation of States to 
uphold and protect the rights of all children, including children on the move, and that these 
steps be reflected in national plans, legislation and policies. Governments should develop 
effective and appropriate child protection systems and integrated, coordinated and 
comprehensive responses for all children, including those on the move.  
</p>
<p>21. The prevalence of chronic diseases, psychological problems and developmental 
disorders was also raised. In some countries, many non-governmental organizations had 
taken the responsibility of providing health services and access to other basic goods and 
services to street children. They urged States to provide comprehensive mobile health-care 
services to children living and/or working on the street, and to focus on preventive, curative 
and promotional aspects of health according to the needs of street children, as well as 
training for health workers. In addition, they called on States to refrain from criminalizing 
life or work on the streets and to develop policies and programmes to provide support for 
families in meeting their responsibilities towards their children. 
</p>
<p>22. During the dialogue, some speakers requested examples of effective measures 
concerning the reintegration of street children and of successful public policies; 
recommendations for international cooperation programmes on this subject; effective 
preventive measures that could be taken at the national level to protect children from 
having to live in the street; as well as how the shift from a charity-based to a rights-based 
approach could make a difference in dealing with street children. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur referred to the importance of different stakeholders working 
together to prevent and protect children in the street. She noted the essential role of those 
who worked directly with children on the street and the need to involve them in integrated 
programmes. There should be long-term social and psychological support and, where 
possible, a return of children to their parents. Legislation should recognize the need to 
protect children and that there should be access to economic activities for children. She 
added that the protection of children living or working in the street required a systematic 
approach and that a process of finding, supporting and rehabilitating them required human 
and financial resources. The family should provide a protective environment to allow 
children not only to develop, but to flourish too. The challenge was how to incorporate </p>


<p>children&#8217;s rights into national, social and development policies, which would require at the 
same time the development of indicators to evaluate progress.  
</p>
<p>24. Father Shanahan pointed out that States should not be looking for magic answers, 
because there is none. If dedicated and trained workers were put on the streets of the cities, 
countries would start finding answers from children; he therefore urged countries to do so. 
Dedicated workers on the streets, together with the street children, could work out realistic 
plans of intervention. States should listen to children and take their opinions into account. 
He appealed to States not to treat street children only in terms of numbers. He believed that 
moving towards a rights-based approach would give children on the streets their voice back 
and that this would be the beginning to finding solutions.  
</p>
<p>25. The Rapporteur stated that countries had to cooperate with the South to obtain 
information on children in the street and to implement the main recommendations of the 
United Nations study on violence against children.5 He found the way in which many 
children of migrant families were treated in detention centres to be unacceptable. He 
regretted that the collective communications procedure was not included in the final draft of 
the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to establish a 
communications procedure of the Open-Ended Working Group.6 Respecting the rights of 
children in the streets implied respecting the rights of children generally by, inter alia, 
eliminating corporal punishment or the death penalty, which were still in force in certain 
countries. The best solution to any problem regarding children was for the States to 
guarantee their human dignity on a daily basis. 
</p>
<p>26. The youth representatives from programmes supported by Plan International stated 
that if everyone in society extended their hand, children would have a better life and 
education. According to the representative of the African Movement of Working Children 
and Youth, States should take care of children living in the street by providing free 
education for children, especially for girls, by building schools in isolated areas and 
vocational training centres for children who had left school. Governments should take 
measures to improve the purchasing power of parents so that they could provide for their 
children, and money should be allocated to maintain schools.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Afternoon panel: &#8220;Conditions of children working and/or 
living in the street: prevention strategies and response&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introductory remarks and statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>27. The afternoon panel, which was moderated by the Vice-President of the Human 
Rights Council, Rodolfo Reyes Rodriguez, focused on the living conditions of children 
working and living on the street, as well as on the prevention strategies and responses. The 
panellists included the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against 
Children, Marta Santos Pais; the Deputy Inspector General of Police of Sindh (Pakistan), 
Abdul Khalique Shaikh; the Director of Proyecto Meninos e meninas da rua (Brazil), 
Marco Antonio Da Silva Souza; the Senior Adviser of UNICEF, Theresa Kilbane; and the 
Special Adviser to the Director-General of ILO, Kari Tapiola. 
</p>
<p>28. The meeting was opened by the Deputy United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, who underscored the urgent need for more reliable and systematic data 
</p>
<p>  
 5 A/61/299. 
 6 A/HRC/17/36. </p>


<p>collection and research on children in street situations, as well as the importance of using a 
gender-sensitive approach to protecting them. She highlighted the recommendations made 
by human rights mechanisms, particularly the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
concerning the development of proactive policies and programmes of prevention, support to 
families and strengthening of assistance, including in education, health care, food and 
shelter. She stated that children in street situations should not be treated as delinquents, but 
that they should instead be provided with preventive and rehabilitative services. She 
emphasized that advocacy needed to be accompanied by coordinated actions among 
Governments, United Nations agencies, civil society, local communities and children 
themselves, and called on the Human Rights Council to make concrete recommendations 
following the day of annual discussion.  
</p>
<p>29. According to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children the true measure of a nation&#8217;s standing was assessed by how much it 
invested in children and how well it fulfilled children&#8217;s human rights. The recognition of 
these rights tended to fade away in the situation of children living or working in the street 
and was replaced by stigma, indifference, invisibility and fear. She stated that, with rapid 
urbanization, the number of children in the streets tended to grow, and with them, inequity, 
exclusion and violence. She stressed that addressing the situation of these children was a 
human rights imperative. Girls were at special risk: in addition to negative social attitudes, 
they endured sexual abuse and exploitation; faced early pregnancy and enhanced 
responsibilities as mothers of a new generation of street children; and still too often, they 
ended up in detention for deviant behaviour &#8220;for their own protection&#8221;. This dramatic 
pattern was seriously worsened by political instability. Across regions, there was a 
worrying trend to criminalize children living and/or working on the street. As noted in the 
United Nations study on violence against children, these children were demonized for 
activities that in no way warranted the kind of cruel and gratuitous violence that they 
endured. She concluded by explaining that it was crucial that national legislation be enacted 
to prohibit all forms of violence against children, everywhere and at all times, and that it 
was imperative that status offences, such as begging, truancy and vagrancy, be abolished. 
She also stressed the urgent need to establish and make widely available safe, child-
sensitive and confidential counselling for children working or living on the street and to 
provide reporting and complaint mechanisms to address incidents of violence. 
</p>
<p>30. The Deputy Inspector General of Police of Sindh (Pakistan) stated that, given that 
street children were more likely to come into conflict with the law, police officers had to be 
aware of different issues, including juvenile justice matters and drug abuse. Police 
perception of street children played a crucial role in shaping the response to the 
phenomenon; sensitization about street children and their rights was therefore essential. He 
outlined the issues and challenges the Sindh police had been dealing with, most of which 
affected all developing countries. There was an increasing awareness in the police 
leadership of the need to improve the handling of street children in large cities. Pakistan 
had taken a number of measures to that effect, including the establishment of five model 
child rights desks in Sindh province, the preparation of a police training manual on the 
juvenile justice system, and short courses and awareness-raising workshops for police 
officers on the rights of street children. Good practices needed to be institutionalized and 
replicated in other provinces and countries, and the capacity-building of police authorities 
needed to be expedited. Community policing matters should be encouraged to take street 
children off the street and reintegrate them back into society.  
</p>
<p>31. The Director of Proyecto meninos e meninas da rua stated that the reality of children 
living in the street is increasingly present but is forgotten in States&#8217; agendas. The lack of 
adequate and timely answer by States, constant negative references by the media and the 
lack of support from society in general increases the stigma and exclusion of children in the 
street, moving them away from true permanent alternatives and solutions. Children on the </p>


<p>street are left to their own fate, confronted with situations of labour exploitation, sexual 
exploitation and even sudden death. He stressed that Government policies were fragmented 
and poorly resourced, and that it was only through holistic public polices that these 
conditions could be changed. Behind each child on the street was an abandoned family with 
no protection. Simultaneous policies of inpatient and outpatient health care (especially 
reproductive health services) and support for education and reintegration programmes 
would provide space for street children and their families to redevelop. Himself a survivor 
of violence and child trafficking on the street, he added that it was very important to work 
with children in their group, acknowledging that the group is their daily reality. He 
explained that, once the child&#8217;s trust has been won, the first step had been taken in the 
process of changing and understanding his or her needs, limitations and possibilities.  
</p>
<p>32. Dialogue was the most relevant educational instrument to promote alternatives for 
children in the street. He suggested that national quantitative and qualitative assessments of 
the situation of children be made and that the family be strengthened as the centrepiece of 
interventions. Professionals should be willing to listen and to believe in the possibility of 
changing a child&#8217;s situation. National plans of coordinated action with guaranteed financial 
resources should address issues of race, economics and social and cultural situations.  
</p>
<p>33. The Senior Adviser for Child Protection of UNICEF explained how the Fund, in 
partnership with Governments and non-governmental organizations, had been working to 
create a more systematic approach that embraced laws, services, behaviours and practices 
that minimized children&#8217;s susceptibility to risk. The necessary components of a protective 
environment included changes in social attitudes, customs and practices that allowed 
children&#8217;s rights to be violated and an emphasis on the accountability of Governments to 
establish the best possible systems for the protection of children, regardless of age, 
disability, ethnicity or religion. Addressing family separation was often an entry point for 
strengthening the overall child protection system. Approximately 131 UNICEF country 
officers were engaged in the protective care of children through programmes ranging from 
policy development to direct care support. Tools were now in place to map and assess child 
protection systems and guide responses for system strengthening. She added that 
Government agencies responsible for child protection systems are often poorly resourced 
and that child protection may not be viewed as a principle mandate for the Government. 
This suggests the need for articulation across sectoral policies, dialogue with other formal 
sector service providers and community groups, as well as common approaches among 
international partners supporting child protection interventions.

<p>34. The Special Adviser to the Director-General of ILO stated that the international 
framework on child labour was set out by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 
the Minimum Age Convention No. 138 (1973) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
Convention No. 182 (1999). To date, 173 Member States had ratified Convention No. 182 
and 158 States were party to Convention No. 138. Although working on the street was not 
deemed to be among the worst forms of child labour as defined by the ILO Conventions, 
the reality of the problem was more difficult to ascertain. Particular attention should be paid 
to children on the street to prevent them from falling through the cracks of protection 
services. There was a great danger that children were seen as perpetrators, rather than as 
victims, of criminal activity. There was ignorance of the fact that many of them ended up 
on the street after escaping from forced activities. The response of ILO relied heavily on 
comprehensive national action plans with relevant authorities and civil society. There was a 
need for better data to understand the situation and to develop activities for professionals 
who worked with children. Prevention, withdrawal and rehabilitation were required to 
combat this problem and specific measures and action plans should be undertaken in each 
phase. The international community had pledged to eliminate all the worst forms of child 
labour by 2016. This could not be done without addressing the issue of street children. </p>


<p><b> B. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>35. As in the morning session, the Human Rights Council divided the second panel 
discussion into two segments. During the ensuing discussion for the second panel, 
statements were made during the first segment by Algeria, Angola, Australia, Canada, 
Costa Rica, Honduras, Maldives, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, Paraguay (on behalf of 
Common Market of the South), the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine and the 
African Union. The National Human Rights Council of Morocco, SOS Kinderdorf 
International7 and Defence for Children International8 also made statements. During the 
second segment, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Egypt, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, 
Morocco, Norway, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, the Sudan, the United States of America, 
Viet Nam and the European Union took the floor. Also speaking were the non-
governmental organizations the Consortium for Street Children,9 Human Rights Advocates,10  
the International Harm Reduction Association11 and Plan International.12 
</p>
<p>36. During the interactive dialogue, speakers again welcomed the presence of youth 
representatives in the annual day discussion and reiterated the causes of why children end 
up on the street, making them more vulnerable to violence, abuse and exploitation. States 
had an obligation to address the issue. Since it was such a complex and comprehensive 
problem, responses should be complex and comprehensive. The identification of reasons 
for which children found themselves on the street might help in devising response 
strategies. In that sense, poverty, particularly in developing countries, was identified as one 
of the main reasons. Structural impediments and socio-economic vulnerabilities prevalent 
in society had an impact on the well-being of children. External factors such as conflicts, 
HIV/AIDS, the effects of climate change and migration aggravated the problem. Some 
children on the street were stateless, refugees, internally displaced or children of illegal 
immigrants. Homelessness had a severe impact on a child&#8217;s development and was a step 
towards lifelong disadvantage. Some countries underlined the major role played by

<p>UNICEF in improving the international community&#8217;s understanding of the complex and 
changing factors causing children to lead a life on the street. 
</p>
<p>37. With regard to prevention, speakers emphasized the need to develop comprehensive 
national strategies and Government coordinating mechanisms to promote children&#8217;s rights; 
to promote family policies aimed at supporting them in their child-rearing responsibilities; 
to prevent as far as possible the separation of children from their families; to provide 
community-based alternatives to avoid the placement of children in institutions; to punish 
perpetrators of violence against children; and to ensure that victims had access to justice.   
</p>
<p>38. Protecting children from harm and promoting their rights required a holistic 
approach with a multiplicity of stakeholders working together in synergy with the 
international community. A holistic approach was a challenge for Governments, as many 
different stakeholders needed to get together and wide gaps remained between policy and 
practice. Also, many countries suffered from a lack of capacity and resources to address 
this issue. The need to create sustainable social welfare support for children living and 
working on the street was stressed. One common denominator was the lack of social 
protection and care and the importance of having institutions in place that were child-
sensitive and enjoyed the trust of children, especially those most vulnerable and 
stigmatized. Speakers referred to different initiatives at the national, regional and 
international levels to help children living on the street and invited countries to share the 
results of their initiatives, as well as examples of best practices. It was essential that 
strategies and responses be developed in a holistic manner in cooperation with relevant 
United Nations bodies, regional organizations and expert non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>39. Non-governmental organizations reiterated that children living on the street were 
fully entitled to assistance and protection from the State without discrimination. Placing 
these children in large care institutions or criminalizing and incarcerating them were 
inappropriate responses. A call was made to States to amend laws criminalizing children for 
status offenses, such as begging and running away. Reference was also made to the 
importance of birth registration, since unregistered children were most vulnerable to abuse 
and exploitation, and were at risk of further abuse if they came into conflict with the law. 
States were urged to ensure that birth registration was available and accessible to all 
children. 
</p>
<p>40. Since the previous time that this issue was given full attention by the United Nations 
(in particular by the General Assembly) in the 1990s, the three main big questions still 
asked were &#8220;how many are there?&#8221;, &#8220;who are they?&#8221; and &#8220;what can we do to help them?&#8221; A 
number of recommendations were made: to develop and consolidate a strategic knowledge 
base capable of informing policies by compiling and disseminating data-collection 
guidelines and examples of best practice, research and child rights-based programming for 
street children; to invest in ongoing analysis of Government and international agency 
budgets; to involve the private sector and utilize social corporate responsibility strategies to 
enhance programme design and policy interventions; to encourage the active participation 
of street children in data collection and programme design; and to highlight street children&#8217;s 
issues in State party reports submitted to the Human Rights Council at the universal 
periodic review and to the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>41. The interactive dialogue brought to light the relationship between juvenile justice 
matters and children living and/or working on the street, given that, in certain countries, 
children were detained for the mere fact of being on the street. Reference was also made to 
the impact that detention has on children. Panellists were asked to provide examples of 
strategies to better integrate children into society, of successful awareness-raising 
campaigns on the issue of street children and on research and studies on the subject, as well 
as statistics and follow-up to the children&#8217;s situation when they grew up.  </p>


<p><b> C. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against 
Children emphasized that young people had great potential and that it was important 
to build a partnership with them. For that reason, the international community had to 
listen to children. It was essential to invest in prevention and in the protection of 
children from all forms of violence. There was a need to understand what led children 
to the street and it was necessary to document the root causes and risk groups for 
better implementation of preventive policies. Violence against children living on the 
street had to be investigated, and children should have access to child-sensitive 
counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms to report incidents of violence. She 
strongly emphasized that the criminal justice system should not be a replacement for 
a child protection system. She hoped that the outcome of the panel discussion would 
be a solid, comprehensive report that the Human Rights Council could revert to in 
2011. At the regional level, States should not miss opportunities to exchange 
information, such as with the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and 
Welfare of the Child and the African day on street children on 16 June. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>The Deputy Inspector General of Police of Sindh, Abdul Khalique Shaikh, 
referred to the sharing of good practices and replicating them in different parts of the 
world. The dialogue pointed at best practices in different areas, such as health, 
education and policing. Best practices had to be disseminated and implemented. He 
added that the real challenge overall was the implementation of existing laws and the 
capacity-building of professionals working with children. International conventions 
were ratified, domestic legislation was enacted and there was proper policy, but the 
failure was in the structures and institutions and the lack of capacity among the 
people dealing with children. Existing structures and institutions should therefore be 
made more effective.  
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Director of Proyecto Meninos e meninas da rua, Marco Antonio da Silva 
Souza, stated that poverty was an important factor that led children to live on the 
street. Professionals working with children in street situations had to consider many 
different aspects in their work:  the family, the community, generational issues, new 
technologies, modes of behaviour, violence, alcohol and drugs. The State had an 
important role to play, together with international bodies, in providing a holistic 
approach to support families and children who were adrift. There was a need for 
political will and financial support to help children in the street. Any strategy 
required the involvement of all actors, particularly those dealing with children on the 
street. It was important to create a space to hear children&#8217;s voices and to ensure broad 
social contribution to any proposed solutions. It was essential to do research and 
determine who street children were, what the most appropriate responses were and 
how they could be expanded and replicated. Laws were frequently very harsh on 
families. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>The Senior Adviser of UNICEF, Theresa Kilbane, emphasized the importance 
of creating policies that were inclusive of children, such as vocational education and 
supporting families. These were important roles that the States needed to play. With 
regard to best practices, UNICEF planned to document by 2012 the lessons learned in 
assisting vulnerable children, taking into account regional meetings and the work 
conducted on the ground. She highlighted the need for the prevention and creation of 
child protection systems to ensure that children did not end up on the street. 
Regarding data, there was a need to collect the evidence of what worked and what did 
not, and who were the most vulnerable children requiring assistance. All of these 
measures required increased investment and adequate human and financial resources.  </b></p>


<p>46. <b>The Special Adviser to the Director-General of ILO, Kari Tapiola, announced 
that, in 2011, the World Day against Child Labour would focus on hazardous work. 
Awareness-raising and educating the general public and the media were important in 
demonstrating that children living and/or working on the street should not be viewed 
as a nuisance and that they were most likely victims of the worst forms of exploitation<i>.</i> 
Not enough was known about the phenomenon of street children; while collecting and 
analysing data was essential, this must not preclude action. Sometimes, simple 
administrative or legal measures went a long way to addressing common problems. 
Measures in juvenile justice must include prevention, assistance and rehabilitation. It 
must not be forgotten that street children were victims too.
