<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report contains the conclusions and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, following her visit to 
Argentina from 13 to 21 April 2011. The aim of the visit was to examine to what extent the 
right to adequate housing is currently being realized in Argentina. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the revival of national housing policies since 
2003 and the national Government&#8217;s recognition that housing is the responsibility of the 
State and therefore requires a considerable budgetary investment. Despite these positive 
developments, a number of factors currently impede the realization of the right to adequate 
housing in Argentina, including the lack of market regulation for land transactions; the lack 
of federal coordination in the formulation and implementation of housing policies; a legal 
framework for evictions that fails to guarantee due process; and a lack of comprehensive 
housing policies that are sufficiently diverse to provide long-term solutions to the various 
housing needs.

<p> The Special Rapporteur considers that, given the progress made in terms of

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Raquel 
Rolnik, conducted an official visit to the Republic of Argentina from 13 to 21 April 2011, 
at the invitation of the Government of Argentina. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Argentina for the 
invitation and for the support provided to her throughout her visit. She would also like to 
thank the United Nations country team for its cooperation, and Argentine civil society and 
the International Alliance of Inhabitants for their active participation in the visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Argentina 10 years after the economic and social 
crisis of 2001, in a context marked by strong economic growth (which has benefited the 
housing sector and has had important implications for the right to adequate housing), by the 
firm commitment of the Government of Argentina to human rights (in particular concerning 
the steps taken to ascertain the truth, and guarantee justice, with regard to events that 
occurred during the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983), and by the active efforts of 
civil society to find ways of ensuring the realization of the right to adequate housing for all. 
</p>
<p>4. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with various public authorities at 
federal, provincial and municipal level, including officials from: the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs; the Office of the Under-Secretary for Urban Development and Housing; the 
National Housing Council; the Housing Institute of the Province of Buenos Aires; the 
Housing Institute of the City of Buenos Aires; the Office of the Chief Public Defender of 
the Nation (<i>Defensor&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n</i>); the Office of the Secretary for Municipal 
Affairs of the Ministry of the Interior; the National Institute to Combat Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Racism; the Office of the Under-Secretary for the Promotion of Human 
Rights; the Office of the Chief Public Defender of the City of Buenos Aires; the National 
Land Commission; the Office of the Under-Secretary for Land-use Planning; the legislature 
of Tierra del Fuego; the Provincial Housing Institute of Tierra del Fuego; the mayor&#8217;s 
office and legislature of Ushuaia; and the government of Tierra del Fuego province. The 
Special Rapporteur also met with parliamentarians and representatives of various political 
groups and United Nations bodies. Lastly, she met with neighbourhood organizations, 
associations of tenants, debtors and occupants, cooperatives, trade union organizations, 
NGOs and academics. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur visited settlements, slums, holdings and squats, as well as 
State-run housing construction projects in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the 
greater Buenos Aires area and the city of Ushuaia. She also took part in a public hearing at 
the Senate, organized by the association Habitar Argentina and attended by delegations 
from many Argentine provinces; in meetings held in the Buenos Aires legislative chamber; 
and in a public hearing in Ushuaia with representatives of Ushuaia and R&#237;o Grande. These 
activities gave the Special Rapporteur an opportunity to hear accounts of typical situations 
in Argentina, including in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the provinces of Buenos 
Aires, Formosa, Tucum&#225;n, Rio Negro and Santiago del Estero, and the cities of Mendoza, 
C&#243;rdoba, Rosario, La Plata, Ushuaia and R&#237;o Grande. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The housing situation in Argentina: general context 
</b></p>
<p>6. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that housing was a source of 
tension and conflict, particularly in certain regions of the country. With 90 per cent of the 
population living in urban areas, and more than 30 per cent concentrated in Buenos Aires </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-17534 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>and the surrounding area, Argentina has had a serious shortage of adequate housing for 
decades. As a result, millions of Argentines are living in substandard conditions in slums 
and other types of inadequate housing. The situation deteriorated from the mid-1970s 
onwards, when there was a shortage of developed land accessible to low-income groups 
and little investment in the installation of mains services for, and the consolidation of, 
informal settlements. 
</p>
<p>7. During the 1990s a number of economic reforms1 that had serious socio-economic 
repercussions were implemented, making the housing situation even worse. Funding for 
public housing policies was scarce throughout the decade, and there was an even greater 
shortage of developed land for low-income groups in a context of falling salaries and rising 
unemployment. In addition, the National Mortgage Bank was privatized and, under the 
privatized system, the cost of public services rose. 
</p>
<p>8. These policies led to a recession, which started in 1998 and culminated in a serious 
social, political and economic crisis at the end of 2001. The shortage of adequate housing 
increased both in quantitative terms (more homeless people) and qualitative terms (more 
overcrowding, lack of adequate services, irregular tenancies, etc.). According to the most 
recent census available, conducted in 2001,2 approximately 20 per cent of all households 
lived in housing that was inadequate in some way.3 Also, a considerable percentage of the 
population &#8212; 15.7 per cent of households &#8212; were occupants in an irregular situation.4 
</p>
<p>9. Despite the fact that employment and income indicators have improved since 2001, 
and that the State has invested considerably in housing policies since 2003, there does not 
appear to have been any real improvement in the housing situation. On the basis of partial 
data published recently by the National Statistics and Census Institute, indicators show a 
small improvement between 2001 and 2010 (in housing sanitation and building materials).5 
While the full results of the 2010 census must be obtained before a more accurate 
assessment of housing needs can be made, information brought to the attention of the 
Special Rapporteur shows that there has been an increase in the number of homeless 
people, informal settlements, slums and squats, an increase in the number of people housed 
in hostels, tenements, rented rooms and halfway houses and an increase in the number of 
overcrowded homes.6 Also, the entire country would appear to be affected by the housing

 Available at www.indec.mecon.ar/webcenso/index.asp. At the time of writing, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>only had partial results of the population, household and housing census carried out in 2010. 
 
</p>
<p>3
 Data compiled by the National Directorate of Housing Policies, Office of the Under-Secretary for 
</p>
<p>Urban Development and Housing, based on the 2001 Population Census, <i>La pol&#237;tica federal de 
vivienda: balance de cuatro a&#241;os de gesti&#243;n</i>, at:  www.vivienda.gov.ar/docestadisticas.php. It should 
be noted that the Office of the Under-Secretary considered the following situations to constitute a 
&#8220;shortage of adequate housing&#8221;: households living in unsafe dwellings that may or may not be 
suitable for renovation, households living in overcrowded rooms in safe dwellings, or overcrowded 
households &#8211; i.e. more than one household per dwelling. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Ibid. In line with the wording used in the census, occupants in an &#8220;irregular&#8221; situation include owners 
</p>
<p>of the housing only, occupants of loaned housing, and de facto occupants.  Occupants in a &#8220;legal&#8221; 
situation, on the other hand, include owners of the housing and land, tenants and dependent 
occupants. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 For example, the number of dwellings built using solid materials, with bathrooms, increased from 
</p>
<p>59.9 per cent to 61.6 per cent, while the number of dwellings without bathrooms decreased from 28.5 
per cent to 22.2 per cent.

<p>crisis, as shown by the &#8220;housing emergency&#8221; declared &#8212; or requested to be declared &#8212; in 
the legislatures of many provinces and cities (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, C&#243;rdoba, 
Tierra del Fuego, Bariloche, Salta, Neuqu&#233;n, etc.). 
</p><p>10. This situation &#8212; renewed insecurity at a time of economic growth and increased 
public investment in housing &#8212; would appear to be related to the fact that prices for land, 
urban land, real estate and rents have risen proportionally more than most people&#8217;s income,7 
and to the lack of policies on landholding, loans and housing options, including for the 
middle classes. Over the past 10 years in the main cities in Argentina, the real-estate and 
construction market has witnessed a boom, driven by speculation and characterized by a 
high percentage of investments aimed at high-income groups. This has restricted access to 
housing for low- to middle-income groups, and has encouraged the spread of informal 
housing.8 
</p>
<p>11. The situation has been exacerbated by the large increase in the number of evictions 
carried out in various regions9 and by the rise in discrimination against specific groups, 
particularly migrants and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations and legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. Argentina is a party to the core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recognizes the 
right to adequate housing as an integral component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living (art. 11), and to other international and regional treaties that recognize the right to 
adequate housing. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent ratification by Argentina of 
the Optional Protocol to the Covenant (31 October 2011). 
</p><p>13. In Argentina, the right to adequate housing has constitutional rank.10 The amended 
Constitution of 1949 recognized the social function of private ownership and the right to 
housing, but only within the framework of the welfare of workers and senior citizens. 
While the 1957 constitutional reform abolished these progressive changes, it introduced a

<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 In the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, for example, in the period 2002&#8211;2006, the price of land 
</p>
<p>rose by an average of 375 per cent. Demi&#225;n Zayat and Victoria Ricciardi, &#8220;El derecho a la defensa en 
los casos de usurpaci&#243;n en la ciudad de Buenos Aires: un estudio emp&#237;rico&#8221;, <i>Revista Institucional de

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 In the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, for example, 43 per cent of the total number of square 
</p>
<p>metres for which multi-family housing building permits were granted between 2002 and 2006 were in 
the &#8220;lavish&#8221; category. A further 38 per cent of permits were requested for developments in the 
&#8220;luxurious&#8221; and &#8220;comfortable&#8221; categories, aimed at high- and middle-income groups. Zayat and

 In the city of Buenos Aires alone, for example, in 2008 at least nine families were evicted every day.

</b></p>
<p>new article 14 bis, under which the right to adequate housing was specifically recognized, 
in the context of social security benefits granted by the State, and access to decent housing 
was required to be guaranteed by law.11 
</p>
<p>14. Under the 1994 constitutional reform (Constitution, art. 75, para. 22), the Covenant 
&#8212; and thus the right to adequate housing &#8212; acquired constitutional rank, as did a number 
of other international human rights treaties, and was considered to supplement all the rights 
recognized under the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>15. The right to adequate housing has, furthermore, been specifically recognized in local 
legislation, in particular in the constitutions of eight provinces (Chaco, Chubut, C&#243;rdoba, 
Formosa, Rio Negro, Salta, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego, Ant&#225;rtida e Islas de Atl&#225;ntico 
Sur) and in the constitution of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.  
</p><p>16. The legislation required under article 14 bis of the National Constitution was never 
passed, and the country still has no framework legislation on this right. The current system 
of public housing in Argentina &#8212; the Federal Housing System &#8212; was established in 1995 
by Act No. 24464, with the specific aim of &#8220;putting the necessary conditions in place to 
provide fast and efficient access to decent housing for persons unable to afford it, in 
accordance with article 14 of the National Constitution&#8221;.12 The Act establishes the funding 
mechanisms for the Federal Housing System, requiring the National Housing Fund 
(FONAVI)13 to fund all or part of the work necessary to ensure compliance with the Act. 
17. In addition to the legislation governing the current public housing system, other laws 
relating to the right to adequate housing have been adopted at national level, including: Act 
No. 21499 (1977), which provides for expropriation on the grounds of public utility;14 Act 
No. 24374 (1994), which established the Formalization of Ownership Scheme for 
occupants of urban buildings intended primarily to provide permanent accommodation;15 
and Act No. 14394, which established the Family Property Scheme, the aim of which is to 
protect a family dwelling from being attached, mortgaged or sold.16 In addition, laws 
introducing special measures to deal with housing emergencies have been passed in a 
number of cities and provinces in Argentina. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to evictions, the Special Rapporteur notes that there is no national legal 
instrument incorporating international standards in this area. On the contrary, against the 
background of the 2001 crisis, Act No. 24441 amended civil and criminal procedures for 
evictions (Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, arts. 680 bis and 684 bis, and Code of 
Criminal Procedure, art. 238) and established the special scheme for home foreclosures, 
which &#8220;created new tools for expediting repossessions and removed the legal safeguards for 
evicted persons&#8221;.17 In practice, under this new legislation, eviction on grounds of

<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 Article 14 bis: &#8220;The State shall grant social security benefits, which shall be comprehensive and

 Established in 1972 by Act No. 19929.

 Before the State can expropriate the land of a private owner, legislation must be passed by the 
</p>
<p>National Congress declaring it to be of public utility and confirming that the property is subject to 
expropriation. The State must pay compensation in cash, in line with the valuation by the National 
Valuation Tribunal.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 Under the Act, in order to benefit from the scheme, a person has to prove that he/she occupied the 
</p>
<p>dwelling publicly, peacefully and continuously for three years prior to 1 January 1992, and must 
demonstrate legitimate cause. A further period of 10 years&#8217; occupancy is then required in order to 
obtain the title.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 The property can only be attached in the event of unpaid taxes or fees relating to the property, a

<p>trespassing, non-payment, expiry of contract or squatting can be ordered as a precautionary 
measure, before a final ruling is handed down. In addition, under the scheme, creditors can 
obtain the early repossession and auction of a property without the need for legal 
proceedings. Debtors cannot raise a defence, lodge an appeal or file an interlocutory plea to 
suspend the early repossession or auction unless they can credibly demonstrate that they 
meet certain specific requirements.18 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Republic of Argentina is a presidential federal State, consisting of 23 provinces 
and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (the legal status of which is in many ways 
similar to that of the provinces). The Argentine federal system is characterized by the 
autonomy of its provinces and municipalities. All provinces are autonomous states that 
exercise all powers not specifically delegated to the Nation, as well as any powers expressly 
reserved by special order when the province was incorporated into the Republic, and have 
the legislative powers set out in their respective constitutions.19 The National Constitution 
also recognizes municipalities as autonomous entities established by the provincial 
governments, through laws governing the exercise of their autonomy.20 
</p>
<p>20. The extensive autonomy enjoyed by the provinces, the Autonomous City of Buenos 
Aires and the municipalities is reflected in the decentralized implementation of housing 
policies. At the level of the national executive branch, the main body responsible for 
housing is the Office of the Under-Secretary for Urban Development and Housing (&#8220;Office 
of the Under-Secretary&#8221;), which formulates national housing policy, and designs, 
implements and funds the national or provincial public housing programmes. However, 
under Act No. 24464, the implementing agencies in the provinces and the Autonomous City 
of Buenos Aires &#8212; the provincial housing institutes and the city&#8217;s housing institute &#8212; are 
responsible (either directly, or in conjunction with the municipalities, communes or 
intermediate entities) for planning, implementing, monitoring, assigning and recovering 
investments made under the National Housing Fund programme, which is the main housing 
programme at national level. In other words, the provinces manage federal funds and assign 
public housing, despite the fact that Act No. 24464 established the National Housing 
Council as a federal, jointly managed body tasked with setting funding distribution rates (in 
line with the principle of federal joint participation) and suggesting assignment criteria to 
the provinces and to the government of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. 
</p>
<p>21. Another body at the level of the national executive branch that plays an important 
role in housing is the National Commission on Land for Social Housing, which directly 
assists the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers in formulating land policies that facilitate the 
provision of suitable land for the implementation of social programmes, and in taking 
action to identify State-owned property that can be used for social purposes.21 
</p>
<p>22. At the level of the executive branch, the Special Rapporteur notes that in 2008 an 
under-secretary&#8217;s office was set up in the Office of the Secretary for Human Rights at the 
Ministry of Justice and Human Rights to deal with economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to adequate housing. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that this

<p>body has a mandate merely to &#8220;promote&#8221; such rights, and does not carry out any protection 
work. 
</p>
<p>23. With regard to the judicial branch,22 both federal and provincial courts have 
competence to rule on human rights matters, while the Supreme Court and lower courts 
have competence to rule on all matters governed by the National Constitution, national 
legislation or international treaties. Despite the constitutional rank of the Covenant and the 
competence of the Supreme Court and lower courts to rule on human rights matters, the 
Special Rapporteur regrets that national and international standards on the right to adequate 
housing have only been applied to a limited extent in the resolution of disputes involving 
the right to housing.23 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to the legislative branch, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the work 
carried out by various committees in the Senate and the National Congress in the area of 
human rights, and the work carried out by the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office (at national and 
provincial level) in the area of the right to adequate housing. 
25. Finally, the Special Rapporteur notes the important work carried out by independent 
bodies to defend the right to adequate housing, in particular the Public Defence Service 
(<i>Ministerio P&#250;blico de la Defensa</i>). The mandate of the Chief Public Defender of the 
Nation (<i>Defensor General de la Naci&#243;n</i>) is not only to represent defendants in specific 
cases, but also to &#8220;make every effort to defend and protect human rights&#8221; and to &#8220;promote 
and implement policies to help groups that are discriminated against to gain access to 
justice&#8221;.24 In this regard, the Chief Public Defender&#8217;s Office has been very active in matters 
relating to the right to housing, as witnessed by the adoption of resolution DGN No. 
1119/08 on protecting minors affected by evictions and the various training and awareness-
raising activities conducted for judges and officials in the public legal service, with the aim 
of improving the way cases involving the right to housing are managed and the defence is 
handled. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the revival and renewed funding of national 
housing policies since 2003 and the national Government&#8217;s recognition that housing is the 
responsibility of the State and therefore requires a considerable budgetary investment.25 The 
Special Rapporteur notes that these policies were introduced as a countercyclical tool to 
kick-start the economy, against the backdrop of the 2001&#8211;2002 crisis, and that this 
influenced the type of policies promoted, which were mainly concerned with financing the 
supply of housing, and were based on the construction and financing of new housing by 
private companies.

information given to the Special Rapporteur during the public hearing at the Senate organized by the 
association Habitar Argentina, between 1992 and 2003 the consolidated public expenditure (national 
and provincial level) for housing and town planning was between 0.24 per cent and 0.49 per cent of 
GDP, while between 2004 and 2008 it was between 0.41 per cent and 0.75 per cent of GDP. 
Budgetary resources assigned to housing and town planning in 2011 were the equivalent of 0.51 per 
cent of GDP.  </p>

<p><b>10</b> GE.11-17534 
</p>
<p>27. Since 2003, the Office of the Under-Secretary has been developing federal 
programmes for persons on low- and low-to-middle incomes, which over time have become 
more diverse and now focus on three areas:26 the construction of new housing (FONAVI-
Revival I and II, Federal Emergency Housing Programme, Federal Housing Solidarity 
Programme); housing improvements (the &#8220;<i>Mejor Vivir</i>&#8221; federal housing improvement 
programme); and neighbourhood improvement and/or land-title regulation (the PROMEBA 
neighbourhood improvement programme). 
28. While housing policy has remained much the same since the 1950s, the total 
investment and number of interventions since 2003 mark a break from the policies for 
housing, urban land and city access implemented after 1976, which have been described as 
&#8220;a series of provisions for the deregulation of markets, with regard to land use, rents and, in 
particular, finance&#8221;.27 Renewed State intervention has had a positive effect on job creation 
in Argentina; according to official sources, it has generated more than 600,000 &#8220;housing 
solutions&#8221;28 since 2003. 
</p>
<p>29. In this context, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts undertaken by 
Argentine civil society &#8212; with support from the State29 &#8212; to set up housing, employment 
and consumer cooperatives, creating a vast social fabric underpinned by the principles of 
solidarity and mutual support in order to deal with the crisis. 
</p>
<p>30. In the face of rampant real-estate and land speculation, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the initiatives undertaken by a number of municipalities to implement land-
management policies,30 in particular the bill to promote low-income housing in Buenos 
Aires province;31 the initiatives provide tools to ensure that developed land is available for 
adequate social housing, whether public, cooperative or private. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the work of the National Land Commission for Social Housing in 
providing urban land for low-income groups, and the establishment in 2004 of the Social 
Land Bank,32 and urges that implementation of decree No. 835/2004 should be regulated as 
soon as possible.

<p><b> V. Challenges and obstacles to the realization of the right to 
adequate housing in Argentina 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Shortcomings of public housing policies 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur observed that, in response to the country&#8217;s many and diverse 
housing needs, the system of funding for housing policies is based only on the production 
of finished dwellings and home improvements. The Special Rapporteur also notes the lack 
of an analytical framework for identifying the various approaches to urbanization and their 
policy requirements. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Office of the Under-Secretary 
has conducted studies on the shortage of adequate housing on the basis of the 2001 census. 
However, censuses provide information only on housing units and not on the quality of the 
urban environment or on the conditions of social integration in the neighbourhoods built. It 
is also regrettable that there are no intermediate mechanisms (between decennial censuses) 
for adjusting policies and procedures accordingly.33 
</p><p>32. The Special Rapporteur considers that, despite the existence of home improvement 
and urban improvement programmes (such as the PROMEBA programme and the Federal 
Housing Improvement Programme) and the efforts made over the last eight years to 
diversify housing policy programmes, the Government&#8217;s priority remains the production of 
finished dwellings (turnkey homes) for low- and middle-income households, with overly 
standardized designs which, in most cases, focus solely on the production of housing and 
not an integrated housing concept. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur notes in 
particular the lack of rental subsidies and regularization policies, and the problems 
associated with implementing self-managed housing policies. Such policies are 
characterized by inadequate resources, poor management, excessive delays in carrying out 
the projects and their low completion rate.34 
33. The Special Rapporteur notes that the housing policies implemented have not as yet 
been accompanied by appropriate planning and land-use policies;35 this often leads to 
housing developments being located far from job and employment opportunities.36 There is 
no national law in Argentina regulating land use and occupation. Thus, particularly at a 
time of intense speculation in the land and housing markets, weak intervention by the State 
in land markets has had an adverse effect on its housing policy, rendering it &#8220;fragmented 
and remedial&#8221;.37

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33
 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur commends the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment 
</p>
<p>and Services on the work carried out by the Office of the Under-Secretary for Land-use Planning in 
order to prepare jointly with other ministries, provinces and municipalities a strategic land-use plan 
for 2010&#8211;2016. Bicentenary/Strategic Land-use Plan, Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment

</p>
<p>34. The shortage of vacant developed land has in fact been one of the main barriers to 
the implementation of programmes to promote access to housing.38 The most common 
mechanism has been the establishment of agreements between the State and the 
municipalities; under these agreements, the State funds the infrastructure and the 
municipalities provide the land. However, in the absence of regulatory frameworks at the 
local level facilitating access to land for low-income households,39 these agreements have 
been easier to implement outside the big cities and in more remote areas without 
infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur also notes the need for greater coordination and cooperation 
among municipal, provincial and national authorities in order to improve the 
implementation of federal housing policies. Despite the adoption of a federal housing 
system and the strengthening of institutions at the national level in terms of the planning 
and funding of these policies, the extensive autonomy enjoyed by the provinces and the 
Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, along with their powers to determine the use of land, 
has had a considerable impact on implementation. Although there is an agreement between 
the State and each province (and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) on implementing 
the national housing programme, there is no obligation on provinces to do so. Thus, for 
example, the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, which accounts for 30 per cent of 
Argentina&#8217;s population, hardly participates at all in national programmes. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes in this regard the shortcomings in the federal housing 
system with respect to the clear allocation of powers, funding and tasks, and considers that 
further efforts should be made to ensure that, in terms of its design, management and 
implementation, the system fully reflects the right to adequate housing as defined in 
international law. The Special Rapporteur notes with particular concern the shortcomings of 
social housing allocation systems. Each province and municipality can define its own 
allocation criteria40 (or even have no criteria at all, as in the Autonomous City of Buenos 
Aires); this opens the door to discrimination, in particular against migrants from other 
countries or from other regions of Argentina.41 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the amendment to Act No. 24464 establishes a 5 per cent quota for persons with 
disabilities in each National Social Housing Fund plan, and that this percentage will have to 
be brought into line with the actual percentages of persons with disabilities in the different 
cities and provinces. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes that the allocation system would 
appear to lack transparency, especially in instances where there is an absence of legally 
established criteria.42 
</p>
<p>37. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern the limited participation of the 
general population and beneficiaries in federal housing programmes (with the exception of

that, in municipal ordinances listing successful applicants, no rationale for the allocation of housing is 
provided and, furthermore, this occurs in a broader context of lack of access to public information 
about housing allocation criteria. </p>

<p>the Federal Emergency Housing Programme, which is based on the establishment of 
cooperatives). Although recognition has been given to organizations voicing criticism over 
access to land and housing, large-scale federal building programmes have been mainly 
designed in cooperation with businesses and trade associations.43 
</p>
<p><b> B. Informal settlements and the occupation of land and housing 
</b></p>
<p>38. In Argentina&#8217;s recent past, informal occupation has been the main form of access to 
land and housing for low-income households. According to several sources, settlements and 
occupations have increased in many of the country&#8217;s urban areas in recent years.44 In 
addition to &#8220;traditional&#8221; slums, the number of informal settlements is reported to be 
increasing; unlike traditional slums, they are located on land that is unsuitable for 
development, have extremely poor living conditions and lack basic infrastructure and 
services.45 In the greater Buenos Aires area, in particular, the increase in the number of land 
occupations and squats is closely linked to the ending of the sale of plots on the city 
outskirts to low-income households. This land is now mainly used for the construction of 
gated communities for high-income households, thereby increasing the uneven and 
fragmented occupation of urban space. 
</p>
<p>39. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern the highly ambiguous 
way in which the authorities have dealt with the issue of land occupations and how this has 
allowed the topic to become the subject of partisan disputes and to be exploited for political 
purposes. This has made the inhabitants of these settlements highly vulnerable, since 
decisions as to whether they are allowed to reside and remain there or are evicted are made 
on a case-by-case basis. The Special Rapporteur notes that this situation is inconsistent with 
land-title regularization policies because, since the last dictatorship (when a slum-
eradication policy was promoted), the State, through a series of initiatives at the national 
and provincial levels, has recognized that regularization and urbanization of informal 
settlements is the lasting solution to the illegal occupation of land. In particular, at the 
national level, under programmes implemented by the National Land Commission, the 
State has the tools available to regularize the occupation of publicly owned land that has 
had permanent housing built on it. In order to regularize informal settlements on private 
land occupied by low-income households, the State can also invoke Act No. 21499 of 
1977.46 Similar or even more ambitious programmes and laws have also been introduced at 
the provincial level, for example the programme implemented by the Autonomous City of 
Buenos Aires to upgrade and install mains services for slums and disadvantaged 
neighbourhoods.47

www.defensoria.org.ar/areastematicas/vivienda10.php. According to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office of the 
Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, for example, the number of people living in slums rose by 300 per 
cent between 1983 and 1991 and by a further 150 per cent in the last decade, to stand at more than 
120,000 people in 2006. Furthermore, there are 200,000 people living in squats and a further 70,000 
in makeshift dwellings. See also Zayat and Ricciardi, &#8220;El derecho a la defensa ...&#8221; (footnote 7 above).

<p><b>14</b> GE.11-17534 
</p>
<p>40. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes that these programmes have achieved 
very little in terms of the regularization and urbanization of informal settlements. 
According to a 2004 report, only 44 per cent of available land had been transferred to the 
provinces, 27 per cent of which had been titled.48 Several factors seem to have adversely 
affected the implementation of these programmes, including the lack of coordination 
between the State, the provinces and the municipalities, the failure of local authorities to 
take action and the increase in the number of people living in irregular settlements.49 In 
addition, the expropriation law has been little used by the Government to guarantee security 
of tenure, although it has been used by some provincial governments. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that even in cases where the decision to upgrade a slum is taken in 
accordance with a law and with institutional consultation mechanisms in place,50 as in the 
case of Villa 31 and 31 bis in the city of Buenos Aires, the same barriers stand in the way of 
implementing the plans, thereby postponing concrete measures indefinitely. 
</p>
<p>41. Although informal occupation of land has been the predominant form of access to 
housing in Argentina in recent years, there is a growing phenomenon in various regions of 
the country whereby people who occupy land or housing are criminalized and stigmatized. 
This applies especially to the migrant population. 
</p>
<p>42. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes that in instances where decisions are made to 
relocate the inhabitants of irregular settlements, mainly because of environmental 
considerations and the health of the persons concerned, it is rare for those communities to 
be offered alternative solutions in line with international standards on the right to adequate 
housing. A typical example in this regard is the clean-up of the Matanza Riachuelo Basin. 
The Special Rapporteur notes the shortcomings in the relocation policies implemented by 
some municipalities within this process: there is a lack of participation by those concerned 
and a lack of public information. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 
implementation of the relocation policy is based on a court order rather than a 
comprehensive urbanization policy for the basin. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Evictions 
</b></p>
<p>43. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received numerous testimonies about the 
exponential increase in the number of evictions carried out in various provinces of 
Argentina, in both urban and rural areas, on the initiative of private actors and the State.51 In

<p>was established in 1991 to &#8220;promote measures to achieve the land-title regularization of publicly 
owned land by its transfer to its occupants&#8221;. This programme was replaced in 2008 by the National 
Social Land Commission under Decree No. 341/2008.

<p>this regard, the Special Rapporteur has noted in particular a proliferation of criminal cases 
involving the offence of squatting in which evictions are generally called for,52 and how, in 
many instances, it is the Government itself that initiates the proceedings.53 
</p>
<p>44. In urban areas, most evictions are reportedly related to the insecurity of tenure of 
people living in slums and other informal settlements and to speculation in the housing and 
land market, which has led to a large increase in rents and the size of mortgages,54 an 
increase in land and building occupations, ever greater interest in urban land on the part of 
investors and, consequently, an increase in the number of conflicts over land and property. 
Evictions in rural areas affect indigenous and campesino communities and would seem to 
be mainly related to the lack of titling of indigenous lands and conflicts over the 
exploitation of natural resources in indigenous and campesino areas. 
</p>
<p>45. Extensive evidence submitted to the Special Rapporteur suggests that, in many 
cases, evictions are being carried out in violation of international standards. Contrary to 
general comment No. 7 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
evictions have, in many cases, been carried out without exploring all feasible alternatives in 
consultation with the affected persons with a view to avoiding, or at least minimizing, the 
need to use force and without a genuine participatory process involving those affected. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes with particular concern that, in cases that reach the 
criminal or administrative courts, the national legislation currently in force55 makes it easier 
for evictions to take place and fails to observe international standards of due process.56 The 
Special Rapporteur is also concerned about what appears to be &#8212; with a few exceptions &#8212; 
a widespread lack of awareness among Argentine judges of international standards on the 
right to adequate housing and evictions. Many of the procedural protections set out in 
general comment No. 7 are ignored and no effort is made to find solutions to the housing 
problems of those evicted.57 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that evictions are exacerbating the 
country&#8217;s housing crisis, since in many cases they have resulted in those affected being 
rendered homeless or exposed to the violation of other human rights, without the State 
taking all appropriate measures to ensure that alternative housing, resettlement or access to 
productive land is available. The Special Rapporteur has noted in this regard the 
shortcomings and inconsistencies in the eviction policies pursued at the national, provincial 
and local levels and the lack of inter-institutional coordination in their implementation.58 
</p>
<p>48. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the excessive use of force by State 
agents and private security personnel during evictions, in particular against vulnerable 
groups and those who have difficulty in accessing justice, such as migrants and members of 
indigenous communities. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that government 
officials are not present during many evictions, which is contrary to international

<p>standards,59 and that judges fail to provide for measures to control the execution of the 
eviction orders they issue. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur received alarming 
information about the events that occurred in the city of Buenos Aires in December 2010 
during the eviction of the occupants of the Parque Indoamericano, when three people were 
allegedly killed by State agents. The Special Rapporteur also notes with deep concern the 
situation of the &#8220;La Primavera&#8221; community (Formosa province), which is made up of 
members of the Qom Navogoh people. During clashes in the context of a land conflict 
between the community and the province of Formosa in November 2010, a community 
member and a police officer were killed, the community was evicted from its ancestral 
lands and their homes were burned along with all their property. The Special Rapporteur 
also notes with great concern the violence used by private cooperatives employed by the 
municipality of Ushuaia to halt irregular settlements.60 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Specific situations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about reports that indigenous 
peoples are discriminated against with regard to housing, that they do not have secure title 
to traditionally occupied community lands and that they are the victims of particularly 
violent forced evictions related to oil, mining and agricultural projects, which are carried 
out without prior consultation with the affected communities and without their 
participation. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur recalls that under article 75, paragraph 17, of the National 
Constitution, Congress is required to &#8220;recognize the ... community possession and 
ownership of the lands that [the indigenous peoples of Argentina] traditionally occupy; and 
to regulate the granting of other lands that are adequate and sufficient for human 
development; none of [these lands] shall be sold, transmitted or subject to liens or 
attachments&#8221;. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption in 2006 of Act 
No. 26160, which suspends for four years61 the execution of any ruling or procedural or 
administrative act involving the eviction of an indigenous community and which also 
establishes a programme providing for a legal cadastral survey with a view to regularizing 
indigenous community property. 
</p>
<p>51. Despite the adoption of this law, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that 
indigenous communities in several of the country&#8217;s provinces are still being evicted (at 
times very violently), facing eviction orders or being threatened with the sale of part of 
their territory.62 In addition, the regularization programme has been implemented only to a 
very limited extent, since to date very few communities have completed the land survey 
process;63 in most provinces only the survey itself has been carried out and in others the 
process has not even started. 
</p>
<p>52. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, although the State has 
invested in the construction of housing for the indigenous population, that housing is

 According to information provided by the State, in April 2009 only seven communities had

</b></p>
<p>reportedly socially and culturally inadequate and in many instances of poor quality and 
without access to services.64 
</p>
<p><b> B. Migrant population 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes the progress made in terms of legislation concerning 
the recognition of rights for the migrant population. Article 14 bis of the Constitution 
recognizes the right to adequate housing for all &#8220;inhabitants&#8221; of the Argentine Nation, in 
other words all persons residing in Argentine territory with the intention of remaining there, 
even though they may not have established full legal domicile. Act No. 25871 of 2004 also 
explicitly states that the rights recognized to the migrant population are not linked to their 
migratory status. 
</p>
<p>54. Despite these developments, the migrant population reportedly faces specific 
barriers to accessing adequate housing; this is reflected in the large percentage of migrants 
living in slums.65 The Special Rapporteur notes with particular concern that migrants suffer 
from discrimination in the allocation of social housing. For example, Act No. 1118/1999 of 
the city of Ushuaia, in the context of a demographic explosion caused by migration, 
establishes a points system for the allocation of housing based on length of residence in the 
city and civic conduct, which is defined on the basis of the irregular occupation of State 
land in the city. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that the rule requiring applicants to 
hold an Argentine national identity document in order to be eligible for the National 
Housing Fund programme not only fails to comply with Act No. 25871, but is also a major 
barrier to migrants&#8217; access to housing, since the time required to obtain an identity 
document can be very long.66 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur has also noted the growing tendency to stigmatize migrants 
living in irregular settlements; this leads to their being associated with drug trafficking and 
crime and to growing tension between &#8220;<i>okupas</i>&#8221; (migrants) and &#8220;<i>vecinos</i>&#8221; (Argentines).67 
Lastly, the Special Rapporteur has noted how, under the <i>Patria Grande</i> programme, which 
promotes the regularization of migrants from member States and associate States of the 
Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), an even more vulnerable category of migrants 
is being created, namely, those from countries not covered by the programme.

<p><b>18</b> GE.11-17534 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>57. <b>In conclusion, the Special Rapporteur believes that a number of factors 
currently impede the realization of the right to adequate housing in Argentina, 
including: the lack of market regulation for land transactions; real estate speculation; 
the lack of federal coordination in the formulation and implementation of housing 
policies; a legal framework for evictions that fails to guarantee due process; and a lack 
of comprehensive housing policies that are sufficiently diverse to provide long-term 
solutions to the various housing needs. The Special Rapporteur considers that, given 
the progress made in terms of legislation and investment in housing and the economic 
growth of recent years, Argentina is in a position to draw up and implement a social 
pact on land use to ensure the implementation of the right to adequate housing for all 
its inhabitants.</b> 
</p>
<p>58. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates her readiness to cooperate in this effort and, 
in this regard, makes the following recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the adoption at the national level of a 
framework law on the right to adequate housing that incorporates existing 
international standards on the right to adequate housing and sets out the budgets and 
basic criteria for all housing policies at the national, provincial and local levels. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends the drafting and enactment of a law that recognizes 
the public function of land-use planning and modifies the general principles that form 
part of the current definition of the right to private property as regulated in the Civil 
Code so as to include the concept of the social function of property. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Public policies 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that a survey be carried out, on the basis 
of the 2010 census results and with the active participation of the municipalities and 
provinces, to map the various settlements and the housing demand created by 
economic investment plans. A national plan on urban land and urban and rural 
housing should also be prepared in line with the Strategic Land-use Plan to develop a 
range of housing programmes and policies and clear allocation criteria.</b> 
</p>
<p>61. <b>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur calls for greater coordination (of 
programmes and available resources), with the greatest possible degree of 
decentralization, in national and provincial public housing and urbanization policies. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls for greater diversity and flexibility in housing 
programmes, to match funds with existing needs and to strengthen programmes 
aimed at improving, completing and extending inadequate housing, regularizing land 
title, promoting access to land and supporting self-build housing, services and 
equipment. The Special Rapporteur also recommends the introduction of a rent 
control policy and the establishment of a rental subsidy programme. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the competent authorities to implement existing 
land management policies effectively, to adopt relevant draft legislation as soon as 
possible and to promptly introduce implementing regulations for Decree No. 835/2004 
in order to establish the Social Land Bank.</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-17534 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the competent authorities to introduce 
transparent housing allocation mechanisms, paying particular attention to the needs 
of the most vulnerable groups, ensuring adequate consultation with the target 
population and establishing social control mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends the repeal of all discriminatory regulations related to the allocation of 
social housing, including those that discriminate on the ground of irregular 
occupation of housing.</b> 
</p>
<p>65. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to strengthen and 
promote participation and consultation mechanisms covering all stages and aspects of 
housing policies, and to strengthen support for cooperatives, mutual societies and 
grass-roots organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>With regard to informal settlements, in view of the lack of an adequate, 
standardized regularization policy, the Special Rapporteur recommends the 
establishment of a general framework for the recognition of rights and clear criteria 
for consolidating settlements and the promotion by the competent authorities of a 
comprehensive regularization policy (via a process of urbanization and administrative 
and land-title regularization and shorter periods for adverse possession of land for 
social housing purposes), definitively integrating these settlements into cities and 
towns, and offering alternatives that comply with international standards on adequate 
housing to the inhabitants of settlements that are not to be regularized. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Evictions 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that where eviction is considered to be justified, 
Argentina has an obligation to ensure that it is carried out in strict compliance with 
the relevant provisions of international human rights law and in accordance with the 
general principles of reasonableness and proportionality. Furthermore, it is obliged to 
provide legal remedies or procedures to those who are affected by eviction orders and 
to see to it that all the individuals concerned have a right to adequate compensation. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to guarantee the right to an 
effective defence in eviction proceedings and recommends that the courts recognize 
persons threatened with eviction as parties to the proceedings. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that free legal aid be guaranteed to those 
who cannot afford a lawyer and that the relevant competent institutions, particularly 
the Public Defence Service, be strengthened and given the resources they need to 
address the claims of vulnerable groups. The Special Rapporteur also urges the full 
application of resolution No. 1190/08 of the Chief Public Defender&#8217;s Office, so that 
public defenders for minors and incompetents intervene in all eviction proceedings 
affecting minors.</b> 
</p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the alignment of national legislation with 
international standards on evictions and in this regard recommends in particular the 
repeal of articles 680 bis and 684 bis</b> <b>of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, 
article 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Title V of Act No. 24441, and the 
amendment of article 181 of the Criminal Code to prevent it from being used to 
criminalize homeless people. The Special Rapporteur urges judges and prosecutors to 
base eviction decisions on the relevant international standards and, in this regard, 
recommends the adoption of a procedural protocol for judges and prosecutors that 
incorporates the relevant international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the adoption and implementation of a 
comprehensive social policy to provide long-term housing solutions for people made </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/53/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.11-17534 
</p>
<p><b>homeless as a result of an eviction. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
competent State authorities to be present during evictions and recommends the 
adoption of a procedural protocol for the security forces in such cases. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges all the competent institutions to implement, in 
the shortest possible time, the programmes provided for under Act No. 26160 
concerning the regularization of the property of indigenous communities, while 
respecting the right of the affected communities to consultation and participation. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Likewise, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to observe the order 
suspending any ruling or procedural or administrative act involving the eviction of an 
indigenous community (Act No. 26160 and Act No. 26554) and recommends that the 
duration of the suspension be extended pending the regularization of indigenous 
community property throughout the country, with full respect for the rights of 
indigenous peoples.</b> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to further incorporate the 
aspect of cultural adequacy in its housing programmes and to ensure that the quality 
of housing, including access to services, is guaranteed in housing programmes for the 
indigenous population. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Situation of the migrant population 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the competent authorities to repeal all criteria 
that discriminate against the migrant population in the allocation of social housing 
and to take any other measure necessary to ensure that the right to adequate housing 
is guaranteed to the migrant population, in full compliance with Act No. 25871.</b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur also urges the authorities to refrain from using any 
stigmatizing language in reference to the migrant population, in particular migrants 
living in irregular settlements. 
</b></p>
