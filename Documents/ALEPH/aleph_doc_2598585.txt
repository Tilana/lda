CHAIRMAN S ADDRESS
Dear Fellow Shareholder,
lam delighted to present Pacifico‘s 2016 Annual Report.
it’s been another difficult year but a year with some pleasing progress, in spite of the challenging market conditions which
confronted the junior resource sector.
Progress on the Company’s projects over the past 12 months has been modest due to ﬁnancial constraints. However, focussed
exploration including drilling programs at both of our key projects in Australia and Colombia has continued to provide a
significantly better geological understanding.
During the year the Company reached its expenditure commitment on our Borroloola West project and in doing so earnt the
right to 51% of the project. Pacifico then went on to elect to form a joint venture with leading Australian copper producer
Sandl'ire Resources, with Pacifico as the operator. As a result of both company’s continuing positive view on the prospectivity
of the project, Sandfire has agreed to contribute its 49% share of all exploration costs towards the 2016 program.
The recent gold price increase has provided additional interest in the Company‘s highly prospective Berrio gold project in
Colombia. With renewed market interest and a much improved gold price, we are conﬁdent that signiﬁcant progress can be
made with the Berrio project in Colombia over the next 12 months.
Pacifico continues to explore with a clear objective of ﬁnding a world class mineral deposit but not without acknowledging the
difficult equity market conditions and making sensible decisions when constrained by limited financial and personnel
resources.
1 would like to acknowledge the work and dedication of our ﬁrst class team who continue to progress the Group's assets With
a highly disciplined approach.
To you our Shareholders, the Board is grateful for your continued support for Pacifico. To our committed and exceptional
team, your Board commend you for the dedicated services. To my fellow Board members your support has been invaluable
during this difﬁcult year.
Market conditions remain challenging, however, 1 sense we may well have seen the bottom of this downturn and rewards are
now available to those juniors With the right portfolio, the right strategy and a clear path of how to return value to Shareholders.
We look fonrvard to an exciting year with new oppoi'lunities in 2016 with the excellent gold price hopefully continuing and a
renewed interest in Junior Exploration
Yours sincerely

BERRIO PROJECT, COLOMBIA - GOLD (PACIFICO 100%)
The Berrio Gold Project is situated in the southern part of the prolific Segovia Gold Belt and is characterised by a number of
artisanal mining operations. The project is 35km from the Magdalena River which is navigable to the Caribbean Sea and has
excellent infrastructure in place including hydro power, water supply, sealed roads and telecommunications coverage.
The local geology has been intruded and is bounded by a fertile granodiorite — a classical and known geological setting for
gold deposits.

A faulted contact, separating the Berrio Sediments from the Segovia Batholith, extends for 14 km within the Berrio Project,
less than 25% (approximately 3 km) of which has been explored in any detail. Paciﬁco interprets this contact to be a critical
control for high grade gold mineralization exploited by artisanal miners in the area. Artisanal miners typically exploit high-grade
but mostly discontinuous lodes in the Berrio Sediments or narrow quartz veins in the SegoVia Batholith, both of which are
abundant close to the contact. Examples of artisanal miners operating at the contact are limited, Paciﬁco believe, this is in
part due to suppressed topography at the contact which often hides the contact below the water table and beyond the reach
of most artisanal minersDuring 2015 Paciﬁco started exploring the contact With soil geochemistry, starting at the north and
working south, and defined several gold in soil anomalies one ofwhich extends unbroken from over 1 km (see figure 3) (see
ASX announcement 25 June 2015).
During July Paciﬁco announced highly encouraging results from a channel sampling program at the Berrio Gold Project.
Channel sampling of an artisinal mine, which exploits mineralization at the contact, identiﬁed significant precious and base
metal mineralization. 11 channel samples from artisanal workings were taken at various intervals covering 22m of contact
strike. Of importance is the fact that these artisanal workings only occupy a small fraction of the 14km mineralised structure
mapped at the Berrio Gold Project. PreVious exploration by Paciﬁco along with these channel sampling results indicate that
mineralisation continues along the contact 20m below surface and remains open at depth as well as to the north and south.
High-grade gold and silver mineralisation hosted at the contact between the Berrio Sediment Package and Segovia Batholith
included:
I 50cm @ 42.49 g/t Au, 77.5 g/t Ag and 0.24% Cu (channel sample 43567)
- 50cm @ 33.24 g/t Au, 145 g/t Ag, 0.34% Cu and 0.34% Zn (43571)
I 80cm @ 31.41 g/t Au, 106 g/t Ag and 0.23% Cu (composite channel sample 43566
and 43570)
- 50cm @ 349 g/t Au, 59.5 g/t Ag, 05% Cu and 23.48% Zn (43559)
Channel sampling was undertaken across two levels and was restricted to faces and pillars left by miners to act as support in
stopes. Prei/ious field mapping, selective grab and soil sampling undertaken by Paciﬁco identified gold anomalisms associated
with the contact between the Berrio Sediments and SegoVia Batholith. See Table 1 for all 11 channel sample results. These
channel sample results strongly support Paciﬁco‘s exploration strategy along the faulted contact between the Berrio Sediments
and SegoVia Batholith.

Soil Sampling
The soil survey, extending across the contact, conciuded with the completion of the East Grid (see ﬁgure 4), earlier sun/eys
were reported previoust (see ASX announcement 25 June 2015).
The East Grid extended 1 km north-south overoi the Berric sediments east of the faulted contact. The western portion of the
scii sun/ey recognized anomalism coincident with artisanal mines. The soil survey suggests that mineralization hosted in the
Benio Sediments diminishes with increasing distance from the faulted contact.

in January 2016 Pacifico announced the commencement of a diamond drilling program at the Berrio gold Project, the planned
(up to 2000m) program targeted three zones of high-interest.
Drill Targeting
Drilling focusing on the contact as it is thought to be the major structure inﬂuencing mineralization in the El Vapor/Berrio area.
A combination of exploration data, collected over two years, highlights three zones considered of highest interest, these three
zones will be targeted in the up-coming drill program:
- Down dip and along strike extensions of HIGH-GRADE mineralization sampled in artisanal mines
- High-interest targets deﬁned by a combination of; ﬁeld mapping of the contact; gold in soil anomalies; and coincident lP

chargeability highs and resistivity lows
- A ﬂexure in the contact with a coincident gold in soil anomaly which is considered by Pacifico as a potential structural

trap which might develop high grade
Summary
Drilling targeted three zones along the contact between the Segovia Batholith and Berrio Sediments. Eleven drill holes were
completed for a total of 986.20m.
Drilling demonstrates the contact is either faulted or intrusive, varying along strike. When faulted the contact acts as a conduit
for ascending ﬂuids manifesting as alteration and or mineralisation. Where the contact is intrusive mineralisation is not
observed.Mineralisation developed at the faulted contact varies, in terms of thickness and grade, along strike and down-dip.
Mineralisation is thought to develop as plunging ore-shoots. To date, Pacifico have investigated only a small portion of its‘
licence area 7 over 10 km ofthe contact and 700 hectares of the Berrio Sediments have yet to be explored in significant detail.
Northern Zone
in the Northern Zone the contact between the Berrio Sediments and Segovia Batholith is sheared. Drilling targeted extensions
of mineralisation at the contact observed and sampled in various artisanal mines. Six drill holes (BE16-026 to BE16-030 and
BE16-036) were completed (555.50 n1) in the Northern Zone, in each instance the contact was crossed, demonstrating a sub-
vertical (80-85 W) dip. Alteration and mineralisation is developed to varying degrees at the contact in each drill hole. BE16-
026, BE16-029 and BE16-036 generated the highest grade intersects (Table 5) - these drill holes targeted mineralisation
under artisanal mines. BE16-027 and BE16-028 targeted along strike extensions of mineralisation in artisanal miners and
hosted lesser developed mineralisation. BE16-026 - Berrio sediments are sheared from the contact (79.24 m) to a downhole
depth of 81.50 n1. Ground clasts of quartz vein with up to 20% coarse grained disseminations of pyrite are recorded in this
shear zone. BE16-029 7 Berrio sediments are sheared from the contact (41.90 m) to a downhole depth of 46.82 m. Clasts of
quartz vein with coarse grained disseminations of pyrite are recorded in this shear zone. BE16-036 - Berrio sediments are
sheared from the contact (55.15 m) to a downhole depth of 61.00 m. A 19 cm‘ quartz vein with 5% pyrite is recorded in the
shear zone as well as clasts of ground quartz vein With pyrite.
“All intersections are reported as downhole intervals. True widths are not known.

Table 5: Signiﬁcant intersections associated with shearing at the contact, Northern Zone.
Central Zone
The contact in the Central Zone Was targeted based on gold in soil anomalies and lP chargeability and resistiVity anomalies.
Four drill holes (BE16-031 to BE16-034) totalling 359.20 m were completed from two platforms demonstrating that the contact
assumes an approximately 45 E dip 7 this is a significant change in orientation when compared to the Northern Zone. BE16-
031 and BE16-032 were drilled from the same platform and targeted the downward projection of gold in soil anomalies
recorded at the contact as well as aiming to undercut arlisanal mine workings. BE16-031 crossed the contact at 35.52 m and
BE16-032 crossed the contact at 37.20 m indicating the contact dips approximately 46 E. The contact is not mineralised.
Mineralisation is conﬁned to narrow (<3 cm) quartz pyrite (+/- galena, sphalerite) veins in zones of healed breccia Within the
Segovia Batholith, these zones are typically sericite altered. BE16-033 and BE16-034 were drilled from the same platform
and targeted the downward projection ofgold in soil anomalies recorded at the contact as well as IP chargeability and resistiVity
anomalies. BE16-033 crossed the contact at 42.15 m and BE16-034 crossed the contact at 46.70 m indicating the contact
dips approximately 42 E. The contact is not mineralised.
Flexure Zone
A flexure in the contact with coincident gold in soil and lP chargeability anomalies was identified as a potential structural trap.
BE16-035 is the only drill hole in the Flexure Zone and measures 71.50 m. BE16-035 crossed the contact at 27.90 m. The
contact is not mineralised.
Discussion of Results
Recent exploration demonstrates that mineralisation and the orientation of the contact between the SegoVia Batholitli and
Berrio Sediments varies signiﬁcantly along strike. Mineralisation in the Northern Zone is associated With sub-vertical shearing
and forms discontinuous ore-shoots which might have greater continuation With depth than along strike. The contact in the
Central and Flexure Zones assumes a moderately easterly dip, is not strongly sheared and does not host signiﬁcant
mineralisation. Gold in soil anomalism, used to aid drill targeting in the Central and Flexure Zones, is probably sourced from
narrow quartz veins in the SegoVia Batholith. Several such veins were intersected by BE16-031, on three occasions these
narrow (<3cm) veins carried grade in excess of 1 g/t over an intervals of 50 cm or greater. Strong lP chargeability (high) and
resistivity (low) anomalies, recorded at the contact, in areas With gold in soil anomalism, in the Central Zone, are not associated
with signiﬁcant mineralisation. This is in stark contrast to previous drilling in the Berrio Sediments which demonstrated a strong
relationship between lP anomalies and zones of significant mineralisation.
During the fourth quarter regional mapping continued to identify additional areas of interest as well as areas of low interest
which can ultimately be excluded from the tenement package to reduce holding costs.
Further Exploration
The Berrio Project is situated within the Segovia Gold Belt, the most proliﬁc gold belt in Colombia, from which millions of
ounces of gold has been produced over 150+ years. The SegoVia Gold Belt continues as a focus for exploration and mine
development Within Colombia. In excess of 10 km of the contact and 700 hectares of Berrio Sediments have yet to be
explored in significant detail, see ﬁgure 1. Subsequent exploration, including, prospecting, mapping and sampling will be
underlaken in these under-explored areas known to host artisanal mines. Efforls are ongoing to identify and gain access to
abandoned arlisanal mines which have not yet been channel sampled. Pacifico will return to active mines, as they advance,
to collect further channel samples.

BORROLOOLA WEST PROJECT, NORTHERN TERRITORY— COPPERIZINClLEAD/SILVERIMANGANESE (PACIFICO
51%)
Paciﬁco has earned the right to a 51% interest in the Borroloola West Project from Sandl'ire Resources NL (“Sandﬁre”) under
a farm-in agreement, through staged exploration expenditures. The Borroloola West Project consists of 12 exploration licences
and 1 mining licence (1 ,817 km), and lies west and northwest of the world class McArthur River zinc-lead mine and Rox
Resources’ recently announced resource at the world class Teena Zinc-lead deposit in the Northern Territory. The project area
is underlain by the Proterozoic age McArthur Basin, the northern extension of the Mt Isa Basin and host to several world-class
sediment hosted massive sulphide (“SHMS”) deposits including the major zinc/lead/silver and copper deposit at Mt Isa and the
zinc/lead/silver deposit currently being mined at the McAi'lhur River (HYC) mine just 25km east of the project tenements. The
project area also lies 200km SW of the world-class Groote Eylandt manganese mine. The exploration conducted by Paciﬁco
on the Borroloola West Project has further enhanced the region‘s prospectivity lor sediment-hosted copper, SHMS base metal
mineralisation (zinc, lead and silver), and Groote Eylandt style manganese deposits, with several prospects now deﬁned and
ready for drill testing.

Paciﬁco
Minerals Ltd

During September 2015 Pacifico announced that it has completed expenditure of$1.5 million at the Borroloola West Project,
thereby earning the right to acquire a 51 % interest from Sandfire. The Company has made an election and provided notice to
Sandl'ire to maintain its 51 % interest in the Projectand form an unincorporatedjointventure. This will see the Company holding
its 51% interest and Sandfire holding a 49% interest.
As a result of both company's continuing positive view on the prospectivity of the project, Sandfire has agreed to contribute
its 49% share of all exploration costs towards the 2016 program which will include reverse circulation (“RC”) drilling of
established targets at the Four Mile, Mariner, Berjaya, Coppermine Creek and Johnstons prospects.
The Borroloola West Project consists of 12 exploration licences (1 ,817 km?), and lies west and noi'lhwest of the world class
McArthur River Zinc-lead mine (ﬁgure 1) and Rox Resources’ recently announced resource at the world class Teena zinc-lead
deposit. Exploration by Paciﬁco continues to conﬁrm the potential of the Borroloola West Project tenements for the discovery
of major base metal deposits.

- At Four Mile (Zn, Pb, Ag) geological mapping has extended the mapped Barney Creek Formation carbonaceous
and pyritic siltstone. The presence of high lead geochemistry (up to 0.26 %Pb laboratory analysis) With associated
zinc and arsenic anomalism, along over 5km of strike, and observations of pyrite and dolomite nodules, are positive
indicators for the presence of relatively shallow and gently dipping, stratiform zinc (lead 7 silver) mineralisation of
the McArthur River style, which can be tested for by RC drilling.

- At Mariner (Zn, Pb, Cu) previous exploration by Mount Isa Mines Ltd obtained a best drill intersection in RDH-1 of
16m at 7.9% Pb, in oxidised cerussite rich material, at the top of the Tooganinie Formation. RC drilling is planned
to test for associated zinc mineralisation.

- RC drilling is also planned to test targets developed on the Berjaya (Zn, Pb), Coppermine Creek (Cu, Ag), and
Johnstons (Zn, Cu, Pb) Prospects.

Coppermine Creek (copper)
Coppermine Creek is situated 100km noi'lh-west of the McArthur River zinc-lead-silver mine. The mineralised Gordons Fault
is seen as outcropping gossans with malachite staining over a strike length of at least 900m. Reverse circulation (“RC”) and
diamond drilling had preViously only been undertaken at the eastern extremity and produced results including 30m @ 1.1%
Cu in RC hole GPR07 and 34m @ 0.5% Cu in RC hole GPR09‘. The 700m strike extent of the mineralised fault to the west
was completely untested by drilling. During the year, Pacifico announced very encouraging visual results from its 3 hole
drilling program at the Coppermine Creek Prospect (see ASX announcement 13 July 2015 for further details). Drill core
demonstrated that the Gordons Fault zone contains broad zones of brecciation and dolomite-silica alteration of siltstones with
both disseminated chalcopyrite and bands of semi-massive chalcopyrite. Stratabound disseminated chalcopyrite away from
the fault was also recognised, associated with a dolomitised ex-evaporite unit.
During the year Pacifico announced assay and interpretation results for the 3 hole drilling program (see ASX announcement
6 August 2015 for further details). Results conﬁrmed that drilling intersected extensive zones of intense fracturing containing
disseminations and lenses of semi-massive chalcopyrite. All three drill holes intersected copper mineralisation and conﬁrmed
the strike continuity of the east-west trending Gordons Fault.
During the year, diamond drilling commenced at Coppermine Creek. However, the Company announced that drilling was
halted (9 November 2015). Diamond drilling ofdrill hole CCD04, positioned to intersect an airborne electromagnetic (“AEM”)
conductivity high, ceased due to total mechanical failure of the drill rig at a depth of 464m. The hole was planned to reach a
depth of 600m, to intersect the highest conductivity of the AEM anomaly, which was considered to be possibly caused by a
significant body of copper mineralisation.
The hole up to 464m intersected some zones of minor copper mineralisation and terminated in siliciﬁed Lower Mallapunyah
Formation sediments, which contain dolomite and dolomitic siltstone horizons that may be conducive hosts for copper
mineralisation. Between 382m and 400m downhole depth a carbonaceous siltstone with disseminated pyrite was intersected
which was considered could be the cause of the AEM anomaly. A down-hole electromagnetic (“DHEM”) was undertaken on
CCD04 with a 400m surface loop capable of detecting conductive zones surrounding the drill hole. Results from the DHEM
survey confirmed the validity of geological interpretation, but indicated the apparent bullseye was likely caused by near surface
effects.

Bing Bang (copper-gold)
During the period Pacifico also completed a two-hole drill program at the Bing Bong prospect. Two diamond holes were drilled
to 400m and 300m respectively, With 100m RC (reverse circulation) pre-collars. A thick sediment package belonging to the
Roper Group was intersected with no signiﬁcant mineralisation. Any intrusive present, as previously interpreted, may be
considerably deeper. The core has been delivered to the NTGS as part of co-funding conditions where the NT Government
will refund 50% of the direct drilling costs.
Four Mile (zinc-lead-silver)
At Four Mile geological mapping conducted during the period identified poorly outcropping Barney Creek Formation (host to
the mineralisation at the McArlhur River Zinc-lead-silver mine) With a possible strike length of over 14km. Selected rock chips
ofoutcrop are consistently high in lead within the Barney Creek Formation package ofsediments. Small pods of gossan in the
Barney Creek Formation sediments contain up 0.26% Pb (A.L.S. laboratory analysis), which is a highly positive indication in
this very weathered terrane for signiﬁcant Zinc 7 lead mineralisation. A versatile time domain electromagnetics (“VTEM”)
survey was conducted previously by Paciﬁco over part of the area. There are clear targets to test the Barney Creek Formation
for relatively shallow Zinc 7 lead mineralisation, With RC and diamond drilling.
Berjaya (zinc-fead-sifver)
The Berjaya tenement lies about 30km west of the McArlhur River Mine, Australia's largest Zinc-lead-silver producer, and one
of the largest zinc-lead-silver deposits in the world, with a total deposit size of 227Mt of 13.4% Zn + Pb3. Also Rox Resources
Ltd‘s recently discovered Teena Deposit (exploration target of60 - 80Mt of 8 - 12% Zn + Pb‘) lies about 18km west of Pacifico‘s
Berjaya tenement. The Berjaya tenement contains the Barney Creek Formation package, and major growth faults, key
geological components at both the McArlhur River mine and the Teena deposit.
Future exploration will likely include drill testing for Zinc-lead-silver mineralisation, targeting the base metal prospective Barney
Creek Formation close to major growth faults.
MOUNT JUKES PROJECT, TASMANIA — GOLD/BASE METALS (PACIFICO 16%, CORONA MINERALS LTD 84%)
The Mt Jukes Project is adjacent to the Vedanta owned Mt Lyell copper/gold project in Tasmania. Corona Minerals Ltd
(“Corona”) is the operator and manager of this project. Further details can be found on Corona‘s website
www.coronaminerals.com.
SPRINGFIELD PROJECT, NEW SOUTH WALES — GOLD (PACIFICO 20%, STONEWALL RESOURCES LTD 80%)
During the quarter Pacifico was advised by the joint venture partner and operator, Stonewall Resources Ltd (“Stonewall”) it
had relinquished the Springﬁeld tenement. Paciﬁco has no interest in pursuing the area.

A. Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration (audited)
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy of the Company has been designed to align director and executive objectives with shareholderand
business objectives by providing a ﬁxed remuneration component and offering speciﬁc long-term incentives based on key
performance areas affecting the Group’s financial results. The Board believes the remuneration policy to be appropriate
and effective in its ability to attract and retain the best executives and directors to run and manage the Group.
The Board’s policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for Board members and senior executives of the
Group is as follows:

- The remuneration policy, setting the terms and conditions for the executive directors and other senior executives,
was developed by the Board. All executives receive a base salary (which is based on factors such as length of
service and experience) and superannuation. The Board reViews executive packages annually by reference to
the Group’s performance, executive performance and comparable information from industry sectors and other
listed companies in similar industries.

- The Board may exercise discretion in relation to approving incentives, bonuses and options. The policy is
designed to attract and retain the highest calibre of executives and reward them for performance that results in
long-term growth in shareholder wealth.

- Executives are also entitled to participate in the employee share and option arrangements.

- The executive directors receive superannuation guarantee contributions required by the government, amounting
to 9.5% during the year and do not receive any other retirement benefits.

- All remuneration paid to directors and executives is valued at the cost to the Group and expensed. Options are
valued using the Black-Scholes methodology.

The Board's policy is to remunerate non-executive directors at market rates for comparable companies for time, commitment
and responsibilities. The Board determines payments to the non-executive directors and reviews their remuneration
annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought when required. The
maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subiect to approval by shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting (currently $200,000). Fees for non-executive directors are not linked to the performance of the
Group. However, to align directors‘ interests With shareholder interests, the directors are encouraged to hold shares in the
Company.

Performance based remuneration

The Group currently has no performance based remuneration component built into director and executive remuneration
packages.

Pacifico Minerals Ltd l Annual Report 1016 Page 26


l
DIRECTORS REPORT
Group performance, shareholder wealth and directors' and executives' remuneration
The remuneration policy has been tailored to increase the direct positive relationship between shareholders’ investment
objectives and directors' and executives‘ performance. Currently, this is facilitated through the issue of options to the majority
of directors and executives to encourage the alignment of personal and shareholder interests. The Board believes this policy
will be effective in increasing shareholder wealth. At commencementof mine production, performance based bonuses based
on key performance indicators are expected to be introduced.
B. Details of remuneration (audited)
Details of the remuneration of the Directors and the Key Management Personnel (“KMP" as defined in AASB 124 Related
Pai'ly Disclosures) of the Group are set out in the followmg table. The key management personnel of the Group include the
Directors and company secretary, as seen below. Given the size and nature of operations of the Group, there are no other
employees who are required to have their remuneration disclosed in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the ﬁnancial report are set out below. These policies have been
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless othenrvise stated. The ﬁnancial report includes the ﬁnancial statements for
Pacifico Minerals Limited ("Parent Entity" or “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group") for the year ended 30 June 2016. The
financial report of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in accordance With a resolution of the Board
of Directors of Paciﬁco Minerals Limited (“Board" or “Directors”) on 2 September 2016. Pacificc Minerals Limited is a company
incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The nature of the operations and
principal activities of the Group are the exploration of mineral tenements in Australia and Colombia.
(a) Basis of preparation
This general purpose ﬁnancial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, other authoritative
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, Australian Interpretations and the Corporations Act 2001.

(i) Compliance with lFRS
Australian Accounting Standards include Australian equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (AIFRS). Compliance
with AIFRS ensures that the ﬁnancial statements and notes of Paciﬁco Minerals Limited comply with International Financial Reporting
Standards (lFRS).

(ii) Historical cost convention
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-
sale ﬁnancial assets, ﬁnancial assets and liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss, certain classes of property, plant and
equipment.

(iii) Going concern basis
The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal business activities and
realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The going concern of the Group is dependent
upon it maintaining sufﬁcient funds for its operations and commitments. The Directors continue to monitor the ongoing funding
requirements of the Group. The Directors are confident that sufﬁcient funding can be secured if required to enable the Group to
continue as a going concern and as such are of the opinion that the ﬁnancial report has been appropriately prepared on a going
concern basis.
(b) Principles of Consolidation

(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group (refer to note 1(d)). lntercompany
transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction proVides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Pacifico Minerals Ltd l Annual Report 1016 Page 45


YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE ZOI 6
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(ii) Investment in associates and joint ventures
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is generally the case
where the Group has significant voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting,
after initially being recognised at cost. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group
has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is deﬁned
as the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant actiVities
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group's share of movements in other
comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. GoodWill relating to the joint venture is included in the
carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor indiVidually tested for impairment. DiVidends received or receivable
from associates andjoint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The ﬁnancial statements
of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made
to bring the accounting policies in line With those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its
investment in its associate orjoint venture. An impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment
with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statementof Prolit or Loss and Other Comprehensive
Income, and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Upon
loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained
investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant
influence orjoint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

(iii) Investment in joint operations
A joint operation is an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities
relating to that arrangement. In respect of its interest in ajoint operation, ajoint operator must recognise all of its assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, including its relative share ofjointly controlled assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
(0) Foreign Currency Translation

(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency"). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in
Australian dollars, which is Paciﬁco‘s functional and presentation currency. The functional currency of the companies subsidiaries in
Colombia is the Colombian Peso.

(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when
they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net
investment in a foreign operation. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borroWings are presented in the income
statement, within linance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement on a net basis
within other income or other expenses.

Pacifico Minerals Ltd I Annual Report 1016 Page 46


YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE ZOI 6
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when
the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair
value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value
through proﬁt or loss are recognised in proﬁt or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-
monetary assets such as equities classiﬁed as available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(iii) Group companies
The results and ﬁnancial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinﬁationary economy) that have
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
- assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance
sheet
- income and expenses for each income statement and statement of comprehensive income are translated at average
exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and
- all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and
other ﬁnancial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a
foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment are repaid, the associated exchange differences are
reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss, as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adiustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
(d) Business Combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments
or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the
assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred also includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value of any pre-existing
equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, With limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the
acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at
fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree‘s net identiﬁable assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of
the net identiﬁable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable
assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all amounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in
proﬁt or loss as a bargain purchase. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the
future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity‘s incremental borrowmg
rate, being the rate at which a similar bonowing could be obtained from an independent ﬁnancier under comparable terms and
conditions. Contingent consideration is classiﬁed either as equity or a ﬁnancial liability. Amounts classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial liability
are subsequently remeasured to fair value With changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
(e) Segment reporting
Operating segments are classiﬁed, identiﬁed and segment information disclosed on the basis of internal reports that are provided
to or received by the Group‘s chief operating decision maker which, for the Group is its Board. The Group operates in Australia
and Colombia and predominately in the ﬁeld of mineral exploration.
(0 Revenue recognition
Interest revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis that takes into account the effective yield on the ﬁnancial assets.
Pacifico Minerals Ltd l Annual Report 1016 Page 47


YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 20) 6
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(9) Income tax
The income tax expense or revenue for the year is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the national
income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences
and to unused tax losses. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the ﬁnancial statements. However, the deferred
income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred income tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected
to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future
taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the
same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset
and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred tax
balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in equity.
(h) Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially borne all the risks and rewards ofownership
are classiﬁed as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the fair value of the leased property or,
if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are
included in other short-term and long-term payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The
finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated
over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term. Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of
ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases
(net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease.
(i) Impairment of assets
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for an
impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inﬂows which are largely
independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than
goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
For cash flow statement presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with
financial institutions, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafls. Bank
overdrafls are reported Within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 20l 6
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(k) Trade and other receivables
Receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less a provision for any uncollectible debts. An estimate for
doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written-off as incurred.
(I) Investments and other financial assets

(i) Classiﬁcation
The Group classiﬁes its investments in the following categories: ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss, loans and
receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for
which the investments were acquired. Management determines the classiﬁcation of its investments at initial recognition and, in the
case of assets classiﬁed as held-to-maturity, re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date. Financial assets at fair value
through proﬁt or loss are ﬁnancial assets held for trading. A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed in this category if acquired principally for
the purpose of selling in the shoi'l term. Derivatives are classiﬁed as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets
in this category are classiﬁed as current assets. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with ﬁxed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those With maturities
greater than l2 months after the balance sheet date which are classiﬁed as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included
in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that the
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an insignificant
amount of held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets, the whole category would be tainted and reclassiﬁed as available-for—sale. Held-to-
maturity ﬁnancial assets are included in non-current assets, except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the reporting
date, which are classified as current assets. Available-for—sale ﬁnancial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities,
are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included
in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within l2 months of the balance sheet date.

(ii) Recognition and derecognition
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date r the date on which the Group commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all ﬁnancial assets not carried at fair
value through proﬁt or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and
transaction costs are expensed to the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows
from the ﬁnancial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and
rewards ofownership. When securities classiﬁed as available-for—sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised
in equity are included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities.

(iii) Subsequent measurement
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available-for—sale ﬁnancial assets and financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘ﬁnancial assets at fair value through profit or loss' category are
presented in the income statement within other income or other expenses in the period in which they arise. Dividend income from
financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss is recognised in the income statement as part of revenue from continuing
operations when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. Changes in the fair value of monetary securities
denominated in a foreign currency and classified as available-for—sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from
changes in amortised cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security. The translation differences
related to changes in the amortised cost are recognised in proﬁt or loss, and other changes in carrying amount are recognised in
equity. Changes in the fair value of other monetary and non-monetary securities classiﬁed as available-for-sale are recognised in
equity.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(iv) Fair value
The fair values of quoted investments are based on last trade prices. If the market for a ﬁnancial asset is not active (and for unlisted
securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length
transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing
models making maximum use of market inputs and relying as little as possible on entity-speciﬁc inputs.

(v) Impairment
The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or Group of ﬁnancial assets
is impaired. In the case of equity securities classiﬁed as available-for—sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a
security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-
sale financial assets, the cumulative loss 7 measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value,
less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss 7 is removed from equity and recognised in
the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments classified as available-for-
sale are not reversed through the income statement.

(Vi) Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement, or for disclosure
purposes. The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and
available-for—sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The quoted market price used for financial
assets held by the Group is the last trade price. The carrying value less impairment prowsion of trade receivables and payables
are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
(m) Plant and equipment
All plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost,
net of theirresidual values, over their estimated useful lives. The rates vary between (0% and 100% perannum. The assets‘ residual
values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written
down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (note
ltill-
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the income
statement. When revalued assets are sold, it is Group policy to transfer the amounts included in other reserves in respect of those
assets to retained earnings.
(n) Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation costs are written off in the year they are incurred apart from acquisition costs which are carried fonNard
where right of tenure of the area of interest is current, and they are expected to be recouped through sale or successful development
and exploitation of the area of interest, or, where exploration and evaluation actiVities in the area of interest have not reached a
stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Where an area of interest is
abandoned, or the Directors decide that it is not commercial, any accumulated acquisition costs in respect of that area are written
off in the ﬁnancial period the decision is made. Each area of interest is also reViewed at the end of each accounting period and
accumulated costs written off to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(0) Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the ﬁnancial year which are
unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are paid on normal commercial terms.
(p) Employee benefits

(i) Wages and salaries, annual leave and other employee benefits
ProVision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering sen/ices up to the reporting date. These
benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave, and long sen/ice leave. Liabilities arising in respect ofWages and salaries, annual
leave and any other employee beneﬁts expected to be settled Within twelve months of the reporting date are measured at their
nominal amounts based on remuneration rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. All other employee benefit
liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outﬂow to be made in respect of serVices provided by
employees up to the reporting date. In determining the present value of future cash outﬁows, the market yield as at the reporting
date on national government bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability, are used.

(ii) Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) and contractors of the Group in the form of share-based payment
transactions, whereby employees and contractors render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled
transactions‘). The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date
at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by an internal valuation using a BIack-Scholes option pricing model. The
cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together With a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting
date').
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects:

I the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and
I the number of options that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group, will ultimately vest.

This opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market
performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. No
expense is recognised foraWards thatdo not ultimately vest, except foraWards where vesting is conditional upon a marketcondition.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁcation of
the original award.
(q) Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options, for
the acquisition of a business, are not included in the cost of the acquisition as part of the purchase consideration.
(r) Earnings per share

(i) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by diViding the proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the Parent Entity, excluding any costs of
servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the ﬁnancial
year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.

(ii) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after
income tax effect of interest and other ﬁnancing costs associated With dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average
number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(5) Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable
from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable
from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the balance sheet. Cash ﬂows are
presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash ﬂows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable
from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash ﬂow.
(t) Rounding of amounts
The Group is of a kind referred to ASIC Corporations Rounding in ﬁnancial Directors’ Reports instrument 2016/191, issued by the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission, relating to the “rounding off" of amounts in the ﬁnancial report. Amounts in the
financial report have been rounded off in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest $1.
(u) Signiﬁcant accounting estimates and judgements
The carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of future events.
The key estimates and assumptions that have signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adiustment to the carring amounts of certain
assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:

(i) Deferred taxation
The potential deferred tax asset arising from the tax losses and temporary differences have not been recognised as an asset
because recovery of the tax losses is not yet considered probable.

(ii) Capitalised exploration costs
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining
whether it is likely that future economic benefits are likely, either from exploration or sale, or where activities have not reached a
stage which permits reasonable assessment.

2. NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS ADOPTED AND NOT YET ADOPTED
(a) New standards and interpretations adopted in 2015/2016 ﬁnancial year
The consolidated entity has adopted all of the new, revised or amending Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the
Australian Accounting Standards Board (‘AASB‘) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. The adoption of these
Accounting Standards and Interpretations did not have any signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnancial performance or position of the
consolidated entity during the ﬁnancial year. Any new, revised or amending Accounting Standards or interpretations that are not
yet mandatory have not been early adopted.
(b) New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have
not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 20i6. The consolidated entity's
assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the consolidated
entity, are set out below.
AASB 9 Financial Institutions
This standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard replaces all previous
versions of AASB 9 and completes the project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. AASB 9
introduces new classification and measurement models for ﬁnancial assets. A ﬁnancial asset shall be measured at amortised cost,
if it is held Within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows, which arise on
speciﬁed dates and solely principal and interest. All other ﬁnancial instrument assets are to be classified and measured at fair value
through proﬁt or loss unless the entity makes an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on equity
instruments (that are not held-for—trading) in other comprehensive income (‘OCI'). For ﬁnancial liabilities, the standard requires the
portion of the change in fair value that relates to the entity‘s own credit risk to be presented in OCI (unless it would create an
accounting mismatch). New impairment requirements will use an ‘expected credit Ioss’ (‘ECL‘) model to recognise an allowance.
Impairment will be measured under a 12-month ECL method unless the credit risk on a ﬁnancial instrument has increased
significantly since initial recognition in which case the lifetime ECL method is adopted. The standard introduces additional new
disclosures. The consolidated entity will adopt this standard from 1 July 20i8 but the impact of its adoption is yet to be assessed
by the consolidated entity.
AASB 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (applicable to annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018).
When eﬁective, this Standard will replace the current accounting requirements applicable to revenue With a single, principles based
model. Except for a limited number of exceptions, including leases, the new revenue model in AASB 15 will apply to all contracts
with customers as well as non monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers
and potential customers. The core principle of the Standard is that an entity will recognise revenue to depictthe transfer of promised
goods or sen/ices to customers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for the goods or services. To achieve this objective, AASB 15 provides the following five step process:

- identify the contractjs) with a customer;

- identify the performance obligations in the contract(s);

- determine the transaction price;

- allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s); and

- recognise revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.
This Standard will require retrospective restatement, as well as enhanced disclosures regarding revenue. The directors anticipate
that the adoption of AASB i5 will not have a material impact on the Group’s revenue recognition and disclosures.
AASB 16: Leases (applicable to annual reporting periods commencing on or after1 January 2019).
AASB 16 removes the classiﬁcation of leases as either operating leases or ﬁnance leases for the lessee eﬁectively treating all
leases as ﬁnance leases. Short term leases (less than 12 months) and leases of a low value are exempt from the lease accounting
requirements. Lessor accounting remains similar to current practice. Although the directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16
may have an impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such
impact.

3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
(a) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to movements in market interest rates on short-term deposits. The policy is to monitor the interest rate yield
curve out to 120 days to ensure a balance is maintained between the liquidity of cash assets and the interest rate return. At 30 June
2016, if interest rates had changed by 4+ 100 basis points from the year-end rates with all other variables held constant, post-tax
loss would have been $13,340 lower/higher (2015 7 change of 100 bps: $26,231 lower/higher) as a result of lower interest income.
The Group's exposure to interest rate risks and the etfective interest rates of financial assets and financial liabilities, both recognised
and unrecognised at the balance date, are as follows:

(b) Net fair values
All ﬁnancial assets and liabilities have been recognised, at the balance date, at amounts approximating their carrying value.
(c) Credit risk exposures
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk, at balance date, is the carrying
amount (net of provision of doubtful debts) of those assets as disclosed in the balance sheet and notes to the financial statements.
As the Group does not presently have any debtors other than GST receivable, lending, signiﬁcant stock levels or any other credit
risk, a formal credit risk management policy is not maintained.

19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(a) Financial risk management objectives
The consolidated entity's activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk, price risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The consolidated entity's overall risk management program focuses on the
unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the ﬁnancial performance of the consolidated
entity. The consolidated entity uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods
include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks, and ageing analysis for credit risk.
Risk management is carried out by senior ﬁnance executives ("Finance Executives") under policies approved by the Board. These
policies include identiﬁcation and analysis of the risk exposure of the consolidated entity and appropriate procedures, controls and
risk limits. Finance Executives identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks within the consolidated entity's operating units. Finance
Executives report to the Board on a monthly basis.

19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(b) Market risk
(i) Foreign currency risk
The consolidated entity undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and is exposed to foreign currency risk
through foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised
financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the entity's functional currency. The risk is measured
using sensitiVity analysis and cash flow forecasting. The carrying amount of the consolidated entity's foreign currency denominated
financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting date was as follows:
Financial Assets Financial Liabilities
2016 2015 2016 2015

Total 22,733 32,931 539,582 665,067
Based on the net exposure to foreign currencies, a change in the foreign exchange rate as at the end of the year would affect
the Group‘s ﬁnancial results as set out below:

against Australian Dollar
American Dollar weakens against 0
Australian Dollar '10 A) ' ' (53358) (66507)
(ii) Price risk
The consolidated entity is not currently exposed to commodity price risk as it is in the exploration phase. The consolidated entity is
indirectly exposed to commodity price movements such as gold, copper and silver as movements in the prices of these commodities
may affect the ability of the consolidated entity to access capital markets.
(iii) Interest rate risk
The consolidated entity's main interest rate risk arises from cash and term deposits held at variable interest rates. Term deposits
issued at ﬁxed rates expose the consolidated entity to fair value risk. The Group policy is to maximise interest rate returns, having
regard to the cash requirements of the exploration and administration operations of the business.
(iv) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the consolidated
entity. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any
provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of ﬁnancial position and notes to the ﬁnancial statements.
(v) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk management requires the consolidated entity to maintain suﬂicient liquid assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents) to
be able to pay debts as and when they become due and payable. The consolidated entity manages liquidity risk by maintaining
adequate cash reserves by continuously monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial
assets and liabilities.
