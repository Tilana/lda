Item 2 – Details of Acquisition
2.1 Nature of Business Acquired
On April 26, 2013 Denison acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Fission Energy Corp. (“Fission”) by way of a court approved
plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) pursuant to Section 192 of the Canada Business Corporations Act. The Arrangement was effected pursuant to
an arrangement agreement dated effective March 7, 2013 (the “Arrangement Agreement”). Fission is a Canadian based uranium exploration company
with properties located in Canada and internationally. Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, certain of Fission’s properties were spun out into a
newly formed exploration company called Fission Uranium Corp. (“Fission Uranium”) and pursuant to the Arrangement, the shares of Fission Uranium
were distributed to the former shareholders of Fission on the Closing Date (as defined below).
The Arrangement was approved by the shareholders and optionholders of Fission on April 23, 2013.
2.2 Acquisition Date
April 26, 2013 (the “Closing Date”).
2.3 Consideration
Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Fission exchanged each common share of Fission held for (a) a new common share of Fission
(“New Fission Share”) and (b) one common share in the capital of Fission Uranium. Subsequent to the exchange, each shareholder of a New Fission
Share received 0.355 of one common share of Denison (the “Exchange Ratio”)and $0.0001 for each New Fission Share held. As a result, Denison
acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Fission. Unexercised options to purchase Fission shares were exchanged for options to
acquire common shares of Denison and Fission Uranium on the basis set out in the plan of arrangement. The holders of warrants to purchase Fission
shares are entitled to receive, upon exercise of their warrants, the number of common shares of Denison and Fission Uranium which the warrantholders
would have been entitled to receive as a result of the Arrangement, if immediately prior to the effective date the warrantholders had exercised their
warrants.
2.4 Effect on Financial Position
There are no plans or proposals for material changes to the affairs of the acquired business that may have a significant effect on the results of operations
and financial position of Denison.
2.5 Date of Report
September 6, 2013.

For the Year Ended

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Shareholders of
Fission Energy Corp.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Fission Energy Corp., which comprise the consolidated statements of
financial position as at June 30, 2012 and 2011, and July 1, 2010 and the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash
flows for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fission Energy Corp. as at June 30,
2012 and 2011, and July 1, 2010, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.

1.
Nature of operations
Fission Energy Corp. (the “Company”) was formed on July 17, 2007 under the laws of the Canada Business Corporations Act as a result of a
plan of arrangement undertaken to reorganize Strathmore Minerals Corp. (“Strathmore”). The Company’s principal business activity is the
acquisition and exploration of exploration and evaluation interests. To date, the Company has not generated significant revenues from
operations and is considered to be in the exploration stage. The Company’s head office is located at 700 – 1620 Dickson Ave., Kelowna, BC,
V1Y 9Y2 and it is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange under the symbol FIS and on the U.S. OTCQX under the symbol FSSIF.
The Company has not yet determined whether its exploration and evaluation assets contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable.
The recoverability of the amounts shown for the exploration and evaluation assets, including acquisition costs, is dependent upon the
existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of
those reserves and upon future profitable production.
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern which assumes that the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business rather than through a process of forced
liquidation. Continued operations of the Company are dependent on its ability to develop its exploration and evaluation assets, receive
continued financial support, complete equity financings, or generate profitable operations in the future. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments to assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Significant accounting policies
(a)
Statement of Compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (“IFRICs”) and the former Standing Interpretations Committee (“SICSs”).
These are the Company’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. Previously the Company prepared its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The comparative
figures presented in these financial statements are in accordance with IFRS.
(b)
Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments, which are
measured at fair value.

Proportionately consolidated
The Company consolidates the wholly owned subsidiaries on the basis that it controls these subsidiaries through its ability to govern their
financial and operating policies. The Company also proportionally consolidates its interest in joint ventures, Waterbury Lake Uranium
Corporation (“WLUC”) and Waterbury Lake Uranium Limited Partnership (“WLULP”), based on its ownership interests.
Intercompany transactions and resulting balances with the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and WLUC and WLULP have been
eliminated to the extent of the Company’s interests.
(d)
Financial Assets
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value and designated upon initial recognition into one of the following four categories: held to
maturity, available for sale, loans and receivables or at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).
Financial assets are designated as FVTPL if the Company manages such investments and makes sure purchase and sale decisions are
based on the fair value in accordance with the Company’s risk management strategy. Financial assets classified as FVTPL are measured at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized through profit or loss.
Transaction costs associated with FVTPL financial assets are expensed as incurred, while transaction costs associated with all other financial
assets are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset.
The Company has classified its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as FVTPL. Financial assets classified as loans and
receivables and held to maturity assets are measured at amortized cost. The Company’s amounts receivable are classified as loans and
receivables. Financial assets classified as available for sale are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other
comprehensive income and loss except for losses in value that are considered other than temporary which are recognized in profit or loss. At
June 30, 2012, June 30, 2011, and July 1, 2010, the Company has not classified any financial assets as available for sale.

Significant accounting policies (continued)
(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits in banks and redeemable term deposits that are readily convertible to cash with an original
term less than 90 days. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are invested with major financial institutions and are not invested in any
asset backed deposits/investments.
(f)
Short-term Investments
Marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value on the date of acquisition and are classified as FVTPL. The carrying value of the
securities is adjusted at each subsequent reporting period to the fair value (based upon the market price and the Bank of Canada quoted
exchange rate if applicable) with the resulting unrealized gains or losses included in profit or loss for the period. Transaction costs relating to
the purchase of marketable securities are expensed directly to profit or loss.
(g)
Foreign Currency Translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars. The financial statements for each of the Company’s subsidiaries are
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates (the “functional currency”). Each entity
in the Company determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that
functional currency. The functional currency determinations were conducted through an analysis of the consideration factors identified in IAS
21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
The functional currency of the Company, the Company’s subsidiaries, and the Company’s joint ventures are as follows:
(i)
Fission Energy Corp. – Canadian dollar
(ii)
Fission Energy Peru S.A.C. – Peruvian New Sol
(iii)
Minera Peruran S.A.C. – Peruvian New Sol
(iv)
Waterbury Lake Uranium Corporation – Canadian dollar
(v)
Waterbury Lake Uranium Limited Partnership – Canadian dollar
Transactions and Balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the Company’s functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date are recognized in profit or loss.
Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.

Foreign Currency Translation (continued)
Foreign Operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and
income and expenses are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of transactions. The exchange differences arising on the
translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive
income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss.
(h)
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis at the following
annual rates based on estimated useful lives:
•   Geological equipment
•   Office equipment
•   Computer equipment
•   Computer software
•   Vehicles
•   Building

An item of property and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the
continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on disposal of the asset, determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in profit or loss.
When an item of property and equipment comprises major components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as
separate items of property and equipment.
(i)
Exploration and Evaluation Assets
The Company records exploration and evaluation assets which consists of the costs of acquiring licenses for the right to explore and costs
associated with exploration and evaluation activity, at cost. All direct and indirect costs related to the acquisition, exploration and
development of exploration and evaluation assets are capitalized by property.
The exploration and evaluation assets are capitalized until the exploration and evaluation assets to which they relate are placed into
production, disposed of through sale or where management has determined there to be an impairment. If an exploration and evaluation
property interest is abandoned, both the acquisition costs and the exploration and evaluation cost will be written off to operations in the
period of abandonment.

Significant accounting policies (continued)
(i)
Exploration and Evaluation Assets (continued)
On an ongoing basis, exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed on a property-by-property basis to consider if there are any indicators of
impairment. If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the exploration and evaluation assets’ recoverable amount is calculated. The
recoverable amount is determined as the fair value less costs to sell for the exploration and evaluation property interest and their value in use.
The fair value less costs to sell and the value in use is determined for an individual exploration and evaluation property interest, unless the
exploration and evaluation property interest does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of other exploration and evaluation
property interests. If this is the case, the exploration and evaluation property interests are grouped together into cash generating units
(“CGUs”) for impairment purposes.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its
recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss for the period.
The Company’s determination for impairment is also based on:
(i)
whether the exploration programs on the exploration and evaluation assets have significantly changed, such that previously
identified resource targets are no longer being pursued;
(ii)
whether exploration results to date are promising and whether additional exploration work is being planned in the foreseeable future;
and
(iii)
whether remaining claim tenure terms are sufficient to conduct necessary studies or exploration work.
Where an impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate and its
recoverable amount, but to an amount that does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognized for the asset (or CGU) in prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the period in which that
determination was made in profit or loss.
(j)
Financial Liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair market value and designated upon initial recognition as FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities classified as other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, other financial liabilities
are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate method is a method of
calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the
rate that discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
The Company’s accounts payable and accrued liabilities and future income tax liability are classified as other financial liabilities.

Financial Liabilities (continued)
Derivatives, including separate embedded derivatives are also classified as FVTPL and recognized at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. The Company has no liabilities or derivatives classified
as FVTPL. Fair value changes on financial liabilities classified as FVTPL are recognized in profit or loss.
(k)
Flow-through Shares
Resource expenditure deductions for income tax purposes related to exploration activities funded by flow-through share arrangements are
renounced to investors under Canadian income tax legislation. On issuance, the Company separates the flow-through share into i) a flow-
through share premium, equal to the difference between the current market price of the Company’s common shares and the issue price of the
flow through share and ii) share capital. Upon expenses being incurred, the Company recognizes a deferred tax liability for the amount of tax
reduction renounced to the shareholders. The premium is recognized as other income and the related deferred tax is recognized as a tax
provision.
Proceeds received from the issuance of flow-through shares must be expended on Canadian resource property exploration within a period of
two years. Failure to expend such funds after the end of the first year as required under the Canadian income tax legislation will result in a Part
XII.6 tax to the Company on flow-through proceeds renounced under the “Look-back” Rule. When applicable, this tax is accrued as a financial
expense until paid.
(l)
Share-based Payments
The Company has a stock option plan whereby it is authorized to grant stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants.
Directors, officers, employees and consultants are classified as employees who render personal services to the entity and either i) regarded
as employees for legal or tax purposes, ii) work for an entity under its direction in the same way as directors, officers, employees and
consultants who are regarded as employees for legal or tax purposes, or iii) the services rendered are similar to those rendered by
employees.
The fair value of stock options issued to employees is measured on the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
assumptions for risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility of the expected market price of the Company’s common shares and an
expected life of the options. The fair value less estimated forfeitures is charged either to profit or loss, or capitalized to the exploration and
evaluation costs over the vesting period of the related options with a corresponding credit to other capital reserves in equity. Stock options
granted with graded vesting schedules are accounted for as separate grants with different vesting periods and fair values.

(l)
Share-based Payments (continued)
The share-based awards issued to non-employees are generally measured on the fair value of goods or services received unless that fair
value cannot be reliably measured. This fair value shall be measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders
service. If the fair value of goods or services received cannot be reliably measured, the fair value of the share-based payments to non-
employees are periodically re-measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model until the counterparty performance is complete, and
any change therein is recognized over the vesting period of the award. The cost of share-based payments to non-employees that are fully
vested and non-forfeitable at the date of grant are measured and recognized at that date.
When the stock options are exercised, the proceeds are credited to share capital and the fair value of the options exercised is reclassified
from other capital reserves to share capital.
The estimated forfeitures are based on historical experience and reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine the appropriate forfeiture rate
based on past, present and expected forfeitures. Management uses the dynamic model to calculate the estimated forfeitures.
(m)
Interest in Joint Venture
The Company has an interest in the Waterbury Lake property through jointly controlled entities, WLUC and WLULP, whereby the venturers
have a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control over the economic activities of the entity. The agreement requires unanimous
agreement for financial and operating decisions among the venturers. The Company recognizes its interest in the joint venture using the
proportionate consolidation method. The Company combines its proportionate share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses
of the joint venture with similar items, line by line, in its consolidated financial statements.
Adjustments are made in the Company’s consolidated financial statements to eliminate the Company’s share of intercompany balances and
transactions. The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date on which the Company ceases to have a joint control over the
joint venture.
(n)
Income Taxes
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the local taxable income or loss for the year, using local tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period, and includes any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in previous years.
Deferred income taxes are recorded using the liability method whereby deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be
applied to temporary differences when they are realized or settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
end of the reporting period.

Income Taxes (continued)
Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences which arise on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not
a business combination and that affects neither accounting, nor taxable profit or loss.
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that
future tax profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.
(o)
Earnings (Loss) per Share
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for its common shares, calculated by dividing the earnings (loss)
attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted loss per share does not adjust the gain or loss attributable to common shareholders when the effect is anti-dilutive.
(p) Related Party Transactions
Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant control
over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Related parties may be individuals or corporate entities. A transaction is
considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between related parties.
(q) New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Not Yet Effective
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been issued by the IASB or IFRIC that are mandatory for
accounting periods beginning after July 1, 2010, or later periods. Some updates that are not applicable or are not consequential to the
Company may have been excluded from the list below.
Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2012
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements
The presentation in the statement of shareholders’ equity or in the notes to the financial statements of other comprehensive income is
amended. The Company does not anticipate a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
IAS 12, Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets
An amendment was made to IAS 12 that provides a practical solution to determine the expected manner of recovery of investment properties
as it relates to the accounting for deferred income taxes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures
The definition of related parties is clarified. The Company does not anticipate a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2013
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures
The amendments to disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 emphasize the interaction between quantitative and qualitative disclosures and the
nature and extent of risks and amends credit risk disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial
statements.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 10 requires an entity to consolidate an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Under existing IFRS, consolidation is required when
an entity has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. IFRS 10 replaces
SIC-12 Consolidation-Special Purpose Entities and parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact the final standard is expected to have on its consolidated financial statements.
IAS 28, Investments in Associates
The standard was amended to include joint ventures in its scope and to address the changes in IFRS 10 to IFRS 12. This amendment is
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the
application of IAS 28 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, which supersedes IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC 13, Jointly
Controlled Entities – Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers. The standard requires the Company to classify its interest in a joint
arrangement as a joint venture or joint operation. This standard will eliminate the use of proportionate consolidation when accounting for joint
ventures, as they will be accounted for using the equity method, whereas joint operations will be accounted for by recognizing the venturer’s
share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management anticipates that this standard will be adopted in the Company’s financial
statements for the period beginning July 1, 2013. The Company is currently evaluating the impact IFRS 11 is expected to have on its
consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
The IASB has issued IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities, which includes disclosure requirements about subsidiaries, joint
ventures, and associates, as well as unconsolidated structured entities and replaces existing disclosure requirements. This standard will
become effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2013. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this new
standard as of its effective date. The Company is currently analyzing the possible impact of this standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement: effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted, sets out in
a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and new required disclosures about fair value measurements. Management anticipates that
this standard will be adopted in the Company's financial statements for the period beginning July 1, 2013, and has not yet considered the
potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 13.
Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2015
IFRS 9, Financial instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. On
December 16, 2011, the IASB amended the effective date of IFRS 9 to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, with early
adoption permitted. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost and classification
and measurement of financial instruments. Management anticipates that this standard will be adopted in the Company's financial statements
for the period beginning July 1, 2015, and has not yet considered the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 9.
3.
First Time Adoption of IFRS
The Company has adopted IFRS with a transition date of July 1, 2010 (“Transition Date”). Under IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards, the IFRS are applied retrospectively at the transition date with all adjustments to assets and liabilities as stated
under Canadian GAAP taken to deficit unless certain exemptions are applied.
The guidance for first-time adoption of IFRS is set out in IFRS 1. IFRS 1 provides for certain mandatory exceptions and optional exemptions
for first time adopters of IFRS. The Company is applying the following exemptions on first-time adoption of IFRS:
•
•
Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at transition date; and
IFRS 2 Share-based Compensation has only been applied to equity instruments granted after November 7, 2002 which had not
vested as at the Transition Date.
The IFRS 1 elections, identified above, and the significant accounting policies, set out in note 2, have been applied in preparing these
consolidated financial statements and selected comparative information presented below. The following tables reconcile the Company’s
statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive loss and statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with IFRS with those
previously prepared and reported in accordance with Canadian GAAP.

3.
First time adoption of IFRS (continued)
Notes to the IFRS reconciliation are as follows:
(a)
Share-based compensation
Under Canadian GAAP, the Company measured share-based compensation related to share purchase options as the fair value of the options
granted using Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized this expense over the vesting period of the options. IFRS 2 Share-based
Compensation, which is similar to Canadian GAAP, requires the Company to measure share-based compensation related to share purchase
options granted at the fair value of the options on the date of the grant and recognize such expense over the vesting period of the options.
IFRS 2 also requires each tranche in an award with graded vesting be considered as a separate grant with different vesting date and fair value
whereas the total fair value of the award was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period under Canadian GAAP.
IFRS 2 also has a broader definition of an employee allowing the Company to group employees and others providing similar services
together. This has resulted in certain consultants to be classified as employees.
Adjustments were calculated only for unvested options issued and outstanding after the Transition Date. As a result of these differences, the
Company has adjusted its share-based payments. The amounts recorded in other capital reserves for share-based compensation increased
by $182,201 as at July 1, 2010, increased by $263,570 for the year ended June 30, 2011 (cumulatively increased by $445,771). In addition,
exploration and evaluation assets have increased by $441,042, net of $7,177 write-down, as at June 30, 2011.
(b)
Flow-through shares
Current Canadian tax legislation permits mining entities to issue flow-through shares to investors, which are securities issued to investors,
whereby the deductions for tax purposes related to exploration and evaluation expenditures may be claimed by investors instead of the
Company. Under Canadian GAAP, in accordance with EIC-146 Flow-through Shares, a deferred tax liability is recognized on the date that the
Company files renouncement documents with the Canadian tax authorities assuming there is reasonable assurance the expenditures will be
made.
In accordance with IFRS, the issue of flow-through share is in substance an issue of ordinary shares and the sale of tax deductions. At the
time the Company issues flow-through shares, the sale of tax deductions is deferred and presented as other liabilities in the statement of
financial position to recognize the obligation to incur and renounce eligible exploration and evaluation expenditures. Accordingly, the
Company recognized a flow-through share premium of $553,350 and of $440,022 for the flow-through share issuances on April 7, 2010 and
December 2, 2010 respectively.
As the renouncement documents have been filed with the tax authorities, the tax benefit passed to the shareholder and the liability has been
recognized in profit or loss as a flow-through premium recovery during the year ended June 30, 2011.

3.
First time adoption of IFRS (continued)
(c)
Income taxes
Unlike Canadian GAAP, IAS 12 prohibits the recognition of deferred taxes at the time of an acquisition where the transaction is not a business
combination. Accordingly, as at June 30, 2011, the Company has reversed the deferred income tax liability of $2,000,000 and the related
deferred income tax valuation allowance of $33,130 that was recognized on the acquisition of the additional 10% interest in WLULP as
described in Note 8(c). In addition, in accordance with IFRS, the Company recognized $140,924 of deferred income tax in respect of prior
years’ share issuance cost as a recovery in equity.
(d)
Foreign currency translation
In accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, each entity determines its functional currency. The wholly
owned subsidiaries changed their functional currency from Canadian dollar to Peruvian New Sol. The carrying value of the Peruvian
exploration and evaluation assets are written off at the end of each reporting period, and therefore there is no impact on the consolidated
financial statements at the date of transition.
4.
Key Estimates and Assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The
Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing
circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond
the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
(a)
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Company’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalized for an
area of interest where it is considered likely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale where the activities have not reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as
to future events and circumstance, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates
and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalized the expenditure under the policy, a judgment
is made that the recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalized amount will be written off in the statement of comprehensive
loss in the period when the new information becomes available.
(b)
Share-based compensation
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and non-employees by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based compensation transactions requires determining the
most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.

Key Estimates and Assumptions (continued)
(b)
Share-based compensation (continued)
This estimate also requires the determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share
option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating share-based
compensation transactions are disclosed in Note 10.

The Company does not have any significant balances that are past due. Significant amounts receivable are current, and the Company does
not have any allowance for doubtful accounts. Due to their short-term maturities, the fair value of accounts receivable approximates their
carrying value.

Exploration and Evaluation Assets (continued)
Title to exploration and evaluation interests involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the validity of title and/or
ownership of claims and exploration and evaluation interests. The Company has investigated title to all of its exploration and evaluation
interests, and to the best of its knowledge, title to all of its properties are in good standing.
(a) North Shore Property, Canada
The Company acquired a 100% interest in a property located in Alberta in fiscal 2008. The property is subject to a 0.75% net smelter returns
royalty on certain mineral production and 4% gross overriding royalty on any diamond production from the property.
The Government of Alberta drafted the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan (“LARP”) to conserve land, which has resulted in some of metallic and
industrial mineral claims to be under temporary restricted status, which includes some claims held by Fission. On August 22, 2012 the
Government of Alberta approved the LARP, and the Company will not be permitted to continue exploration on claims within the zoned land.
Accordingly the Company has recorded a write-down of $3,594,513 to the property. The Company will approach the Government of Alberta for
compensation of all expenditures incurred plus loss of future opportunities.
(b) Duddridge Lake Property, Canada
The Company acquired a 100% interest in certain claims located in north-central Saskatchewan in fiscal 2008.
(c) Waterbury Lake Property, Canada
The Company acquired a 100% interest in certain claims located in Saskatchewan in fiscal 2008. On January 30, 2008, it completed an earn-in
agreement on the property with the Korea Waterbury Uranium Limited Partnership (“KWULP”). Under the agreement, the Company granted
KWULP the exclusive rights to earn up to a 50% interest in the Waterbury Lake property by funding $14,000,000 of expenditures on or before
January 30, 2011. Additionally, the Company retained an overriding royalty interest in the property of 2% of net smelter returns. On April 29,
2010, KWULP had fully funded its $14,000,000 of expenditures and consequently earned a 50% interest in the property.
The earn-in agreement required that on completion of the earn-in period, the joint venture participants agree to form a joint control Limited
Partnership to hold the property and on August 16, 2010 the Waterbury Lake Uranium Limited Partnership (“WLULP”) agreement was signed,
and now supersedes the original earn-in agreement. WLULP was officially formed December 30, 2010.
The Company had 12 months from the completion of the earn-in agreement during which time it could acquire an additional 10% interest in
WLULP for $6,000,000. On April 12, 2011, the Company exercised its back-in option by paying KWULP $6,000,000 and now holds a 60%
interest in WLULP. The WLULP agreement also requires that the Company and its partners spend a total of $30,000,000 for exploration and
evaluation costs over a three year period in proportion to their interest in WLULP, of which $21,903,339 has been incurred by WLULP as of
June 30, 2012. The Company was appointed operator for WLULP and is entitled to a management fee equal to 10% of expenditures for
operator services.

at $0.90 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $13,200,330. Each common share unit consists of one common share and one half of one
share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant is exercisable into one common share at $1.00 for a period of 2 years. A value of $1,518,214 was
attributed to the common share warrants based on the Black-Scholes pricing model and has been included in other capital reserves. $160,955
was reclassified from share issuance costs to other capital reserves for the proportionate share of warrants in share units issued. The

$469,297 based on the Black-Scholes pricing model which was included in other capital reserves. Each Broker Warrant is exercisable into one
common share of the Company for a period of 2 years at a price of $1.00 per share with an expiry date of December 2, 2012. The assumptions
used in the Black-Scholes pricing model includes a volatility of 125%, risk free interest rate of 1.68%, expected life of 2 years, and a dividend
rate of 0%. All warrants vested immediately on the date of grant. A flow-through liability of $440,022 was recognized, which reduced share
capital and was taken into income when the renunciation documents were filed.
February 24, 2011
The Company completed a private placement of 9,375,000 common share units at $0.80 per unit for gross proceeds of $7,500,000. Each
common share unit consists of one common share and one half of one share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant is exercisable into one
common share at $1.00 for a period of 2 years. A value of $1,773,865 was attributed to the common share warrants based on the Black-
Scholes pricing model and has been included in other capital reserves. $293,016 was reclassified from share issuance costs to other capital
reserves for the proportionate share of warrants in share units issued. The Company issued 516,465 common shares to finders with a fair
value of $593,935, paid $81,541 of expenses and issued 774,696 broker warrants with an attributed value of $552,240 based on the Black-
Scholes pricing model which was included in other capital reserves.

date of February 24, 2013. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model included a volatility of 115%, risk free interest rate of

10. Share capital and other capital reserves (continued)
(a)
Private placements (continued)
November 17, 2011
The Company completed a private placement of 11,800,000 flow-through common shares at $0.85 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of
$10,030,000. The Company paid agents’ commissions of $637,915 plus $77,771 of expenses and issued 623,701 non-transferable broker
warrants with an attributed value of $364,064 based on the Black-Scholes pricing model which was included in other capital reserves. Each
broker warrant is exercisable into one common share of the Company for a period of 2 years at a price of $0.85 per share with an expiry date
of November 17, 2013. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model includes a volatility of 107%, risk free interest rate of 0.90%,
expected life of 2 years, and a dividend rate of 0%. All warrants vested immediately on the date of grant. Since the Company’s share price
increased between the date the consideration to be received for the flow through shares was set and the closing date, which was used for the
transaction allocation under the residual method, no value was ascribed to the flow through liability.
(b)
Stock options and warrants
The Company has a stock option plan which allows the Board of Directors to grant stock options to employees, directors, officers, and
consultants. The exercise price of each option is based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant less any
applicable discount. The options can be granted for a maximum term of five years and vesting terms are determined by the Board of Directors
at the date of grant.

In January 2008, the Company received an invoice in the amount of $182,616 from a Canadian drilling company for services allegedly
performed during 2007. The plaintiff has commenced legal proceedings and the Company is defending itself against the action. No amount
has been accrued in these financial statements in respect of the claim as the outcome is not determinable at this time. Any costs ultimately
assessed against the Company in respect of this claim will be recorded in the period in which the actual determination of the liability, if any, is
made.
16. Capital management
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pursue
and exploration and development of its exploration and evaluation assets and to maintain a flexible capital structure which optimizes the
costs of capital at an acceptable risk.
The Company depends on external financing to fund its activities. The capital structure of the Company currently consists of common shares,
stock options and share purchase warrants.
Changes in the equity accounts of the Company are disclosed in the statement of shareholders’ equity. The Company manages the capital
structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may attempt to issue new shares, acquire or dispose of assets or adjust the amount of
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The issuance of common shares requires approval of the Board of Directors.
In order to facilitate the management of its capital requirements, the Company prepares annual expenditure budgets, which are approved by
the Board of Directors and updated as necessary depending on various factors, including capital deployment and general industry
conditions. The Company anticipates continuing to access equity markets and the use of joint ventures to fund continued exploration and
development of its exploration and evaluation assets and the future growth of the business.

Financial instruments and risk management
International Financial Reporting Standards 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy that reflects the
significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2—inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3—inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts receivable and accounts
payable and accrued liabilities. For cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, carrying
value is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of short
term investments represents their quoted market price.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are designated as held for trading and therefore carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gain or loss recorded on the statement of comprehensive loss.
The Company’s financial instruments are exposed to a number of financial and market risks, including credit, liquidity and foreign exchange
risks. The Company does not currently have in place any active hedging or derivative trading policies to manage these risks since the
Company’s management does not believe that the current size, scale and pattern of its operations would warrant such hedging activities.
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will not discharge its obligations, resulting in a financial loss to the
Company. The Company has procedures in place to minimize its exposure to credit risk. Company management evaluates credit risk on an
ongoing basis including counterparty credit rating and activities related to trade and other receivables and other counterparty concentrations
as measured by amount and percentage.
The primary sources of credit risk for the Company arise from:
1.
Cash and cash equivalents;
2.
Short-term investments; and
3.
Amounts receivable.
The Company has not had any credit losses in the past, nor does it expect to have any credit losses in the future. At June 30, 2012, the
Company has no financial assets that are past due or impaired due to credit risk defaults.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its obligations with respect to financial liabilities as they fall due. The
Company’s financial liabilities are comprised of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company frequently assesses its liquidity
position by reviewing the timing of amounts due and the Company’s current cash flow position to meet its obligations. The Company
manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances to meet its anticipated
operational needs.
The Company’s financial liabilities, consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, arose as a result of exploration and development of
its exploration and evaluation interests and other corporate expenses. Payment terms on these liabilities are typically 30 to 60 days from
receipt of invoice and do not generally bear interest. The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of the Company’s
financial liabilities.

Market risk is the risk that the fair value for assets classified as held-for-trading and available-for-sale or future cash flows for assets or
liabilities considered to be held-to maturity, other financial liabilities and loans or receivables of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market conditions. The Company evaluates market risk on an ongoing basis and has established policies and procedures for
mitigating its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk, as it does not hold debt balances
and is not charged interest on its accounts payable balances.
(d)
Foreign exchange risk
The Company has foreign subsidiaries and therefore foreign exchange risk exposures arise from transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. Although the functional currency of the Company is Canadian dollars, the Company also conducts business in US Dollars
(“USD”) and Peruvian New Soles (“PEN”). The Company does not use any derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

Financial instruments and risk management (continued)
(d)
Foreign exchange risk (continued)
Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that the Company incurs in its operations. However, although the Company’s costs are
incurred primarily in Canadian dollars, any change in the value of PEN and USD against the Canadian dollar can affect the costs of operations
and capital expenditures. The Company maintains its cash balances in Canadian dollars and exchanges currency to meet its PEN and USD
obligations on an as needed basis, thereby reducing the exchange risk on cash balances.
The Company is exposed to currency risk through the following Canadian dollar equivalent of financial assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than Canadian dollars:
Cash and cash equivalents
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
June 30, 2012     June 30, 2011    
July 1, 2010  
   PEN      USD     PEN      USD     PEN      USD  
   3,719      10,995     4,171     16,450     3,868     15,738  
    —       (41,737)     —        (4,983)     —        (1,305) 
    
 
   3,719     (30,742)    4,171     11,467     3,868     14,433
Based on the above net exposures at June 30, 2012, a 10% change in USD against the Canadian dollar would result in a $1,099 (June 30, 2011
—$1,147, July 1, 2010—$1,443) change in the Company’s net income or loss; similarly a 10% change in the PEN against the Canadian dollar
would result in a $372 (June 30, 2011—$417, July 1, 2010—$387) change in the Company’s net income or loss.
18. Subsequent Events
Subsequent to June 30, 2012:
(a) On July 5, 2012, the Company completed an Arrangement Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Pitchstone
Exploration Ltd. (“Pitchstone”). Based on 45,208,185 Pitchstone shares outstanding, the Company issued 9,697,159 (ratio of 0.2145) of their
Common Shares to complete the transaction, representing approximately 8.4% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common shares.
The 3,825,000 Pitchstone options are exercisable into 820,463 Common Shares of the Company with exercise prices ranging from $0.70 to
$2.00. The 2,878,490 Pitchstone warrants are exercisable into 617,436 Common Shares of the Company with exercise prices ranging from
$0.65 to $1.17.
Pitchstone is a uranium exploration company operating in three districts in Canada and Namibia. The property portfolio features 13 projects in
the eastern Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, five of which are 100% owned. In addition, there are two joint venture projects in Namibia and
several joint venture projects in the Hornby Bay Basin, Nunavut.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended June 30, 2012
(Expressed in Canadian dollars)
18. Subsequent Events (continued)
(a)
As Pitchstone is in the early stage of exploration and does not yet have any processes or outputs, the acquisition will be accounted for as a
purchase of assets. The difference between the purchase consideration and the adjusted book values of Pitchstone’s assets and liabilities
will be assigned to “Exploration and evaluation assets”. The purchase price of the acquisition will consist of the fair value of the Company’s
Common Shares, based on the issuance of 9,697,159 Common shares at $0.445 per share for consideration of $4,315,236, the fair value of
stock options and warrants and certain other transaction costs.
(b)
70,000 stock options were expired/forfeited.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
For the six month period ended December 31, 2012
(Expressed in Canadian dollars)
1.
Nature of operations
Fission Energy Corp. (the “Company”) was formed on July 17, 2007 under the laws of the Canada Business Corporations Act as a result of a
plan of arrangement undertaken to reorganize Strathmore Minerals Corp. (“Strathmore”). The Company’s principal business activity is the
acquisition and exploration of exploration and evaluation assets. To date, the Company has not generated significant revenues from
operations and is considered to be in the exploration stage. The Company’s head office is located at 700 – 1620 Dickson Ave., Kelowna, BC,
V1Y 9Y2 and it is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange under the symbol FIS and on the U.S. OTCQX under the symbol FSSIF.
The Company has not yet determined whether its exploration and evaluation assets contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable.
The recoverability of the amounts shown for the exploration and evaluation assets, including acquisition costs, is dependent upon the
existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of
those reserves and upon future profitable production.
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern which assumes that the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business rather than through a process of forced
liquidation. Continued operations of the Company are dependent on its ability to develop its exploration and evaluation assets, receive
continued financial support, complete equity financings, or generate profitable operations in the future. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments to assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
2.
Basis of Preparation
(a)
Statement of Compliance
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”) using accounting policies consistent with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations of the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRICs”) and the former Standing Interpretations Committee (“SICSs”). The condensed
consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the board of directors on March 1, 2013.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited annual financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2012 prepared in
accordance with IFRS.
(b)
Basis of Presentation
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial
instruments, which are measured at fair value.
The accounting policies applied in preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with
those applied and disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2012.

Basis of Preparation (continued)
(b)
Basis of Presentation (continued)
The IASB issued a number of new and revised International Accounting Standards, IFRS amendments and related interpretations which are
effective for the Company’s financial year beginning on or after July 1, 2012. For the purpose of preparing and presenting the financial
statements for the relevant periods, the Company has consistently adopted all these new standards for the relevant reporting periods. At the
date of the authorization of these financial statements the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following new and revised Standards and
Interpretations.
(i)
IFRS Standards Adopted
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (Amended)
The presentation in the statement of shareholders’ equity or in the notes to the financial statements of other comprehensive income has been
amended to differentiate elements of other comprehensive income that may subsequently be measured through profit and loss to be
differentiated from those items that will not.
IAS 12, Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets (Amended)
An amendment was made to IAS 12 that provides a practical solution to determine the expected manner of recovery of investment properties
as it relates to the accounting for deferred income taxes.
(ii)
IFRS Standards Not Yet Adopted
Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2013
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures
The amendments to disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 emphasize the interaction between quantitative and qualitative disclosures and the
nature and extent of risks and amends credit risk disclosures. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial
statements.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 10 requires an entity to consolidate an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Under existing IFRS, consolidation is required when
an entity has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. IFRS 10 replaces
SIC-12 Consolidation-Special Purpose Entities and parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact the final standard is expected to have on its consolidated financial statements.

IFRS Standards Not Yet Adopted (continued)
Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2013 (continued)
IAS 19, Employee Benefits
In June 2011, the IASB issued an amended IAS 19. The Standard requires recognition of changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset)
including immediate recognition of defined benefit cost, disaggregation of defined benefit cost into components, recognition of
remeasurements in other comprehensive income, plan amendments, curtailments and settlements. In addition there are modifications in
accounting for termination benefits, including distinguishing benefits provided in exchange for service and benefits provided in exchange for
the termination of employment and affect the recognition and measurement of termination benefits. The Company does not anticipate a
significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
IAS 28, Investments in Associates
The standard was amended to include joint ventures in its scope and to address the changes in IFRS 10 to IFRS 12. This amendment is
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the
application of IAS 28 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements
In May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, which supersedes IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC 13, Jointly
Controlled Entities – Non-Monetary Contributions by Venturers. The standard requires the Company to classify its interest in a joint
arrangement as a joint venture or joint operation. This standard will eliminate the use of proportionate consolidation when accounting for joint
ventures, as they will be accounted for using the equity method, whereas joint operations will be accounted for by recognizing the venturer’s
share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management anticipates that this standard will be adopted in the Company’s financial
statements for the period beginning July 1, 2013. The Company is currently evaluating the impact IFRS 11 is expected to have on its
consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 12, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
The IASB has issued IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities, which includes disclosure requirements about subsidiaries, joint
ventures, and associates, as well as unconsolidated structured entities and replaces existing disclosure requirements. This standard will
become effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2013. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this new
standard as of its effective date. The Company is currently analyzing the possible impact of this standard on its consolidated financial
statements.

IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement: effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted, sets out in
a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and new required disclosures about fair value measurements. Management anticipates that
this standard will be adopted in the Company’s financial statements for the period beginning July 1, 2013, and has not yet considered the
potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 13.
Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2014
IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation – Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
In December 2011, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 32. The amendment clarifies the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable
right to set-off”. The amendments also clarify the application of the IAS 32 offsetting criteria to settlement systems (such as central clearing
house systems) which apply gross settlement mechanisms that are not simultaneous. The Company does not anticipate a significant impact
to its consolidated financial statements.
Accounting standards anticipated to be effective July 1, 2015
IFRS 9, Financial instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. On
December 16, 2011, the IASB amended the effective date of IFRS 9 to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, with early
adoption permitted.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost and classification and measurement of
financial instruments. Management anticipates that this standard will be adopted in the Company’s financial statements for the period
beginning July 1, 2015, and has not yet considered the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 9.

Key Estimates and Assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The
Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing
circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond
the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Company’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of expenditure being capitalized for an
area of interest where it is considered likely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale where the activities have not reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as
to future events and circumstance, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such estimates
and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalized the expenditure under the policy, a judgment
is made that the recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalized amount will be written off in the statement of comprehensive
loss in the period when the new information becomes available.

Key Estimates and Assumptions (continued)
(b)
Share-based compensation
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and non-employees by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for share-based compensation transactions requires determining the
most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires the determination
of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making
assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating share-based compensation transactions are disclosed in Note 9.

Acquisition of Pitchstone Exploration Ltd.
On July 5, 2012, the Company completed a Plan of Arrangement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Pitchstone Exploration
Ltd. (“Pitchstone”). Based on 45,208,185 Pitchstone shares outstanding, the Company issued 9,697,159 (ratio of 0.2145) of their common
shares to complete the transaction, representing approximately 8.4% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. The
3,825,000 Pitchstone options entitle holders to purchase 820,465 common shares of the Company with exercise prices ranging from $0.70 to
$2.00 and expiring between October 5, 2012 and November 1, 2016. The 2,878,490 Pitchstone warrants entitle holders to purchase 617,441
common shares of the Company with exercise prices ranging from $0.65 to $1.17 and expired January 27, 2013 without exercise. The
purchase price allocation presented in these statements is preliminary, subject to change and is expected to be finalized by the year ended
June 30, 2013.
Pitchstone is a uranium exploration company operating in Canada and Namibia. Pitchstone owns a 73.62% interest in its subsidiary,
Pitchstone Exploration Namibia (Pty.) Ltd. The property portfolio features 13 projects in the eastern Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, five of
which are 100% owned. In addition, there are two joint venture projects in Namibia and several joint venture projects in the Hornby Bay Basin,
Nunavut.
As Pitchstone is in the early stage of exploration and does not yet have any processes or outputs, the acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase of assets. The difference between the purchase consideration and the adjusted book values of Pitchstone’s assets and liabilities
had been assigned to “exploration and evaluation assets”. The purchase price of the acquisition and the assets acquired are described
below:

The fair value of the stock options and warrants of Pitchstone was estimated as of July 5, 2012 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions:
Risk Free Interest Rate
Expected Life—Years
Annualised Volatility
Dividend Rate

0.96  
 
70%  
0%

Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the estimate of the share price volatility. Changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the Company’s stock options and warrants.

Exploration and Evaluation Assets (continued)
Title to exploration and evaluation interests involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the validity of title and/or
ownership of claims and exploration and evaluation interests. The Company has investigated title to all of its exploration and evaluation
interests, and to the best of its knowledge, title to all of its properties are in good standing.
(a) Duddridge Lake Property, Canada
The Company acquired a 100% interest in certain claims located in north-central Saskatchewan in fiscal 2008.
(b) Waterbury Lake Property, Canada
The Company acquired a 100% interest in certain claims located in Saskatchewan in fiscal 2008. On January 30, 2008, it completed an earn-in
agreement on the property with the Korea Waterbury Uranium Limited Partnership (“KWULP”). Under the agreement, the Company granted
KWULP the exclusive rights to earn up to a 50% interest in the Waterbury Lake property by funding $14,000,000 of expenditures on or before
January 30, 2011. Additionally, the Company retained an overriding royalty interest in the property of 2% of net smelter returns. On April 29,
2010, KWULP had fully funded its $14,000,000 of expenditures and consequently earned a 50% interest in the property.
The earn-in agreement required that on completion of the earn-in period, the joint venture participants agree to form a joint control Limited
Partnership to hold the property and on August 16, 2010 the Waterbury Lake Uranium Limited Partnership (“WLULP”) agreement was signed,
and now supersedes the original earn-in agreement. WLULP was officially formed December 30, 2010.
The Company had 12 months from the completion of the earn-in agreement during which time it could acquire an additional 10% interest in
WLULP for $6,000,000. On April 12, 2011, the Company exercised its back-in option by paying KWULP $6,000,000 and now holds a 60%
interest in WLULP. The WLULP agreement also requires that the Company and its partners spend a total of $30,000,000 for exploration and

owned Patterson Lake claims and Alpha’s Hook Lake Property. The joint venture participants share costs in proportion to their interest in the
joint venture. This is presently a 50%—50% basis. In November 2011 one additional claim was staked and in December 2011 six claims were
staked. In fiscal 2012 two claims were allowed to lapse and as a result the Company recorded a $1,976 write-down of acquisition costs and

The Company acquired a 100% interest in a property located in Alberta in fiscal 2008. The property is subject to a 0.75% net smelter returns
royalty on certain mineral production and 4% gross overriding royalty on any diamond production from the property.
The Government of Alberta drafted the Lower Athabasca Regional Plan (“LARP”) to conserve land, which has resulted in some of metallic and
industrial mineral claims to be under temporary restricted status, which includes some claims held by Fission. On August 22, 2012 the
Government of Alberta approved the LARP, and the Company will not be permitted to continue exploration on claims within the zoned land.
Accordingly, in fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a write-down of $3,594,513 to the property at June 30, 2012. The Company is currently
evaluating its options including approaching the Government of Alberta for compensation of all expenditures incurred plus loss of future
opportunities.

November 17, 2011
The Company completed a private placement of 11,800,000 flow-through common shares at $0.85 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of
$10,030,000. The Company paid agents’ commissions of $637,915 plus $77,771 of expenses and issued 623,701 non-transferable broker
warrants with an attributed value of $364,064 based on the Black-Scholes pricing model which was included in other capital reserves. Each
broker warrant is exercisable into one common share of the Company for a period of 2 years at a price of $0.85 per share with an expiry date
of November 17, 2013. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model include a volatility of 107%, risk free interest rate of 0.90%,
expected life of 2 years, and a dividend rate of 0%. All warrants vested immediately on the date of grant. Since the Company’s share price
increased between the date the consideration to be received for the flow-through shares was set and the closing date, which was used for the
transaction allocation under the residual method, no value was ascribed to the flow-through liability.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model include a volatility of 80%, risk free interest rate of 1.14%, expected life of 2 years
and a dividend rate of 0%. All warrants vested immediately on the date of the grant. A flow-through liability of $700,070 was recognized and
was reported as a reduction to share capital and will be taken into income when the renunciation documents are filed.

13. Contingency
Page 24
In January 2008, the Company received an invoice in the amount of $182,616 from a Canadian drilling company for services allegedly
performed during 2007. The plaintiff has commenced legal proceedings and the Company is defending itself against the action. No amount
has been accrued in these financial statements in respect of the claim as the outcome is not determinable at this time. Any costs ultimately
assessed against the Company in respect of this claim will be recorded in the period in which the actual determination of the liability, if any, is
made.
14. Subsequent Events
Subsequent to December 31, 2012 the Company:
(a) Completed a non-brokered private placement financing of 4,000,000 common share units at a price of $0.50 per unit for gross proceeds of
$2,000,000. Each common share unit consists of one common share plus one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant is
exercisable at $0.65 for a period of 2 years. The company paid $60,300 in finder’s fees in connection with this private placement;
(b)
Entered into a binding letter agreement with Denison Mines Corp. (“Denison”) dated January 16, 2013, pursuant to which Denison and
Fission will seek shareholder approval for Denison’s acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Fission after Fission has transferred
certain of its assets to a new company (“Spinco”). The transaction is expected to be structured as a plan of arrangement under which the
shareholders of Fission will receive 0.355 of a common share of Denison and one common share of Spinco for each Fission common share
held. The assets being transferred to Spinco will include the Patterson Lake and Patterson Lake South (“PLS”) properties, North Shore
property, Clearwater West property, Peru properties and the ending working capital of Fission. The transaction will be subject to regulatory
and Fission shareholder approvals. In certain circumstances, a $3.5 million break fee may be payable;
(c)
61,435 stock options expired and 10,000 stock options were forfeited;
(d)
Issued 4,000,000 share purchase warrants in connection with the non-brokered private placement;
(e)
617,441 warrants granted on July 5, 2012 expired without exercise. The Company applied to the TSX Venture Exchange to extend the
expiry date of 4,945,733 warrants issued as part of the Company’s unit private placement completed on February 24, 2011 from February 24,
2013 to April 1, 2013. The remaining 516,462 warrants issued as part of the February 24, 2011 private placement expired without exercise;
(f)
Obtained a waiver from Denison of the milestone requirement to spend $500,000 on the Johnston Lake property by February 28, 2013 as
part of the Company’s option to earn in an additional 29% interest. This waiver does not affect the total expenditure requirement of
$1,000,000 by February 28, 2014.

DENISON MINES CORP.
Notes to the Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements
(Unaudited, expressed U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted)
1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements have been compiled for the purposes of inclusion in the information circular of
Fission Energy Corp (“Fission”) dated March 22, 2013. These pro forma financial statements have been prepared by the management of
Denison Mines Corp (“Denison”) in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and give effect to a proposed plan of arrangement under which all of the issued and outstanding
shares of Fission are acquired by Denison as described in Note 2 (the “Arrangement”). These pro forma financial statements include:
a)
b)
a pro forma combined balance sheet as at December 31, 2012 prepared from information derived from Denison’s audited consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and Fission’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012, converted to U.S dollars
at par, as if the Arrangement was completed on December 31, 2012 and giving effect to the assumptions as described in Note 3; and
a pro forma combined statement of operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012 prepared from information derived from
Denison’s audited statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 and Fission’s unaudited statement of operations for the
year ended September 30, 2012 prepared as described in Note 5.
These pro forma financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only, and do not purport to represent the financial position that
would have resulted had the Arrangement actually occurred on December 31, 2012 or the results of operations that would have resulted had
the Arrangement actually occurred on January 1, 2012. Further, these pro forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the
future financial position or results of operations of Denison as a result of the Arrangement and should be read in conjunction with the
following interim and year-end consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS:
a)
b)
Denison’s audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 incorporated by reference in Fission’s
circular dated March 22, 2013; and
Fission’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and the audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2012 incorporated by reference into Fission’s circular dated March 22, 2013.
2.
PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT
Pursuant to an arrangement agreement dated March 7, 2013, Denison and Fission propose to carry out a plan of arrangement, subject to
approval by the security holders of Fission, applicable regulatory authorities and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Conditional upon,
among other things, certain assets of Fission being spun out to a new company (“Spin Co”), to be held pro rata by current Fission
shareholders, Denison proposes to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fission in exchange for Denison shares at a ratio of
0.355 shares of Denison for each share of Fission. Upon completion, the pre-combination shareholders of Denison and Fission will own
approximately 88.8% and 11.2%, respectively, of the combined company excluding the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants.
For accounting purposes, Fission is not considered a business under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” as it is currently not capable of
generating outputs that can provide a return to Denison. As a result, transaction costs incurred by Denison relating to the combination will be
capitalized as part of the purchase price and individual fair values will be assigned to the assets and liabilities being acquired – no goodwill
will be recorded.
3.
PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following pro forma adjustments and the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired are preliminary and subject
to change. Detailed plans for combining the operations of Denison and Fission, upon completion of the Arrangement, have yet to be finalized.
Additional costs may be incurred due to these efforts and have not been reflected in these pro forma financial statements.
a)
Purchase Price
- 77 -
The total preliminary purchase price of $72,410,000 for the Arrangement was determined as follows:
(in thousands)
Fission common shares outstanding at March 1, 2013, in thousands
Exchange ratio
Common shares of Denison issued to Fission shareholders, in thousands
Fair value per Denison common share, in CAD$
Fair value of Denison common shares issued, in CAD$

Fair value of Denison common shares issued
Fair value of outstanding Fission share purchase warrants assumed by Denison

4,721  
 
1,625  
 
 
   
$ 72,410
The fair value per Denison common share of CAD$1.27 per share is the closing price of Denison shares on the TSX on March 6, 2013, the day
immediately prior to the March 7, 2013 announcement of the Arrangement. Pursuant to the Arrangement, and subject to certain adjustments
to the exercise price, the holders of Fission stock options and warrants will ultimately receive the right to acquire common shares of both
Denison and Spin Co. The calculation of the fair values of the Fission warrants and stock options, which will ultimately be satisfied by the
issuance of Denison common shares, was prepared using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and using the March 6, 2013 fair value
amount of CAD$1.27 per Denison common share as an input in the model.
The final purchase price for the Arrangement will depend on the market price of Denison common shares on the closing date. Each CAD$0.01
increase in the market value of the Denison common shares increases the equity component of the purchase price by approximately
$537,000.
b)
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The following table uses Fission’s September 30, 2012 published unaudited balance sheet converted to USD$ using a $CAD to USD$ foreign
exchange rate of 1.0000 and allocates the preliminary purchase price based on Denison management’s estimate of the fair values after giving
effect to the assets and liabilities being transferred to Spin Co as part of the Arrangement:

In arriving at the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, Denison’s management has made assumptions, estimates and assessments
which are in part based on publicly available information at the time these pro forma financial statements were prepared and in part based on
an interpretation of the provisions in the Arrangement agreement itself. The actual fair values of the assets and liabilities will be determined as
of the closing date of the Arrangement and may differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the preliminary purchase price allocation set
out in the table above.
c)
Impact of asset and liability spin-out to Spin Co on statement of operations
In arriving at the statement of operations acquired, Denison’s management has made assumptions which are consistent with those used to
determine the assets and liabilities acquired and which are consistent with its internal expectations of incremental costs to be incurred as a
result of the combination. These amounts may not be indicative of actual amounts incurred once more detailed operating plans are put into
place.
d)
Accounting for exploration expenditures
Fission’s policy is to capitalize exploration expenditures while Denison’s policy is to expense them. An adjustment of $7,697,000 has been
made to the combined pro forma statement of operations to expense the exploration expenditures capitalized by Fission on the mineral
properties being acquired by Denison.
