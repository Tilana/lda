</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Council on the issue of human rights and international solidarity, including Commission 
resolution 2005/55 and Council resolutions 6/3 and 7/5, and taking note of the reports presented 
by the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity, in particular his latest one 
(A/HRC/9/10), 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in June 1993, 
States pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of 
obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that 
sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a 
complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential 
in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive 
development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually 
and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, 
friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political 
systems, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing 
countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, to 
make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated to official 
development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to allocate 
0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance, and recognizing 
the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity to establish new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
intragenerational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their responsibilities 
towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for present and future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of </p>

 <p></p>
<p>solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges 
must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world problems 
through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure that the 
needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, and to 
hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their development 
endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full realization of all human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, and 
that it shall be implemented without any conditionality, and on the basis of mutual respect, in full 
compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular 
respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated with the 
fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the independent 
expert in his mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to visit their 
countries, to enable him to fulfil his mandate effectively; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft 
declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in further 
developing guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting 
this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its realization; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all major 
United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social 
fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other 
relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of his 
mandate; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests </i>the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare inputs to 
contribute to the elaboration of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity, and to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles with a view to promoting and protecting this right; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to submit a report on the implementation of the 
present resolution to the Council at its twelfth session; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to continue its examination of this issue at its twelfth session under 
agenda item 3.
