<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Monaco was held at the 11th meeting 
on 28 October 2013. The delegation of Monaco was headed by Jos&#233; Badia, Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. At its 18th meeting, held on 31 October 2013, the Working Group adopted 
the report on Monaco. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Monaco: Guatemala, the Philippines and 
Uganda.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Monaco: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/MCO/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/MCO/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/MCO/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Monaco through the 
troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 11th meeting of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, held 
on 28 October 2013, Mr. Jos&#233; Badia, Minister for Foreign Affairs, introduced the national 
report and made an opening statement in which he expressed gratitude for the opportunity 
to report on the progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights and the 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Human Rights Council in 2009. With 
regard to the preparations for the second universal periodic review, he emphasized the 
involvement of civil society and of the National Council (Parliament). 
</p><p>6. He described some of the specific features of the Principality of Monaco: (a) it is an 
independent sovereign State that covers an area of only 2.02 square kilometres; (b) it is a 
hereditary constitutional monarchy that upholds the primacy of the law and ensures the 
separation of powers; (c) it is a country made up of only 36,000 inhabitants, of which about 
8,600 have Monegasque nationality. 
</p>
<p>7. He noted that the Principality was deeply committed to the promotion and protection 
of human rights, which constituted priorities in its national and international policy. Many 
of the laws it had adopted reflected that commitment, including (a) Act No 1.359 of 20 
April 2009 on the establishment of an antenatal and family support coordination centre, 
amending article 248 of the Criminal Code and article 323 of the Civil Code; (b) Act No. 
1.387 of 19 December 2011 amending Act No. 1.155 on nationality; (c) Act No. 1.382 of </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-10028 
</p>
<p>20 July 2011 on the prevention and punishment of specific forms of violence; and Act No. 
1.399 of 25 June 2013 instituting reforms of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of 
police custody. 
</p>
<p>8. He indicated that draft legislation on video surveillance was being prepared, to take 
account of recommendations made by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council 
of Europe. 
</p>
<p>9. Concerning the inheritance rights of children, he pointed out that Act. No. 1.278 of 
29 December 2003, amending certain provisions of the Civil Code, the Code of Civil 
Procedure and the Commercial Code, had abolished any distinction in the inheritance rights 
of natural children, legitimate children and children born out of wedlock or of an incestuous 
relationship. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to harassment in the workplace, he recalled that Act No. 1.382, cited 
above, had resulted in the inclusion in the country&#8217;s criminal legislation of Criminal Code 
article 236-1, which made any harassment a criminal offence, and that on 18 December 
2012, the Government of the Principality had submitted to the National Council Bill No. 
908 on harassment and violence in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>11. On the international level, in 2009, the Principality signed the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Bill No. 893 on the protection, autonomy and 
promotion of the rights and freedoms of persons with disabilities was submitted by the 
Government to the National Council on 7 December 2011 and was currently under study. 
The text had been drawn up with reference to the provisions of the Convention that the 
Principality was planning to ratify. 
</p>
<p>12. Monaco had also signed the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and 
Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention) and the 
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The process of ratifying the latter 
convention was currently under way. 
</p>
<p>13. The Principality had also ratified the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and 
the Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Education, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 
</p><p>14. Monaco was soon to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of 
Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (the so-called Lanzarote 
Convention). The impact of possible accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was currently being 
studied.  
</p>
<p>15. Following extensive consideration of the possibility of ratifying the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court, the Government had identified the difficulties that would 
be involved in terms of concordance with institutions at the domestic level. Nevertheless, 
Monaco was determined to cooperate with the Court on a case-by-case basis in matters for 
which the Court requested its collaboration, as had already been the case in the past. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation of Monaco indicated that the Principality had established 
extraterritorial jurisdiction over cruel treatment, torture, mutilation, organ trafficking, rape 
and other forms of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>17. The head of the delegation noted that the Principality of Monaco had either set up or 
modernized the following institutions: (a) the antenatal and family support coordination 
centre; (b) the Princess Charlene Children&#8217;s Home (formerly the Sainte D&#233;vote home); and 
(c) the Rainier III Clinic Gerontology Centre. In early 2014, the office of High 
Commissioner for the protection of rights and freedoms and mediation had been 
established. </p>


<p>GE.14-10028 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>18. In terms of raising public awareness about the struggle against discrimination, for 
several years the Department of National Education, Youth and Sports had been involved in 
a number of publicity campaigns. Prevention programmes were likewise taking part in the 
effort to combat any form of discrimination: for example, as part of their work to combat 
sexually transmitted infections, they dealt with the exclusion of persons living with AIDS. 
Every year Monaco celebrated International Women&#8217;s Day, the International Day of 
Persons with Disabilities and Universal Children&#8217;s Day. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the participation of women in decision-making, the head of the 
delegation said that generally speaking, there were many women in senior posts in the 
Monegasque administration and in the judiciary. There was also a woman Minister for 
Public Works, the Environment and Urban Development. 
</p>
<p>20. Concerning non-discrimination in employment, he said that rights in the field of 
employment were exercised without distinction, with the exception of rights related to 
nationality or place of residence, and there, it was a matter not of discrimination but of 
priorities specifically based on the limited number of citizens of Monaco, who constituted a 
minority in their own country. Regarding social security for workers, he emphasized that 
the relevant legislation and regulations created no distinctions among beneficiaries based on 
their nationality.  
</p>
<p>21. With regard to disabilities, he noted that in 2006, the Principality of Monaco had 
appointed a delegate with responsibility for persons with disabilities. The Government had 
made significant efforts in recent years to facilitate access to public facilities, to the city and 
to public transport for persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>22. Concerning domestic violence, he noted that Act No. 1.382 of 20 July 2011 on the 
prevention and punishment of specific forms of violence had been adopted for the very 
purpose of strengthening the protection of women, children and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>23. In education, he explained that courses in history and civics were based on the 
fundamental principles of human rights, education in which was compulsory in the 
Monegasque national curriculum. 
</p>
<p>24. Despite the particularly difficult international context, the Government sought to 
maintain its commitment to international solidarity with the most disadvantaged groups 
(women, children, persons with disabilities) and those severely affected by conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the interactive dialogue, 40 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>26. The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomed the statement of Monaco and expressed 
concern over a number of human rights violations, including the distinction between native 
and naturalized Monegasques, which introduced a form of discrimination regarding the 
rights associated with citizenship. It noted that Monegasque legislation had created various 
groups of foreigners with different rights and protection according to their nationality. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Ireland noted that Monaco had signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court and acknowledged its commitment to cooperate with the Court on a case-by-case 
basis. Ireland considered that the ratification of the Rome Statute would be a timely 
reaffirmation of the commitment Monaco had made to fighting impunity. It noted that the 
criminalization of defamation was a disproportionate restriction on freedom of expression. 
Ireland made recommendations. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.14-10028 
</p>
<p>28. Malaysia commended efforts concerning legislation on criminal procedure, 
nationality, violence and offences against children, which would enhance human rights. It 
also noted the commitment of Monaco to combating poverty, providing quality education, 
promoting and protecting the rights of women and children and improving living conditions 
for persons with disabilities. It encouraged Monaco to share best practices regarding 
persons with disabilities, particularly in the field of education. Malaysia made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>29. Maldives welcomed the steps taken to strengthen human rights, particularly through 
legislation. It commended the implementation of recommendations from the first UPR 
cycle. It praised the human rights record of Monaco and was encouraged by its human 
rights education programme in schools and in the workplace. It noted the excellent work of 
the Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Unit and the Minister for Appeals and 
Mediation, and commended Monaco for its bill to strengthen the mediator&#8217;s mandate. 
Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Mauritius commended Monaco for its commitment to the UPR and noted the 
positive steps it had taken to amend existing legislation and adopt new legislation aimed at 
promoting and protecting its citizens&#8217; rights. Mauritius wished to learn about best practices 
in Monaco on guaranteeing a better quality of life for persons with disabilities. It further 
commended Monaco for its initiatives to raise awareness about human rights. Mauritius 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>31. Mexico commended Monaco for its work on human rights education. It took note of 
the amendments Monaco had made to its legislation regarding the transfer of nationality, in 
particular from the mother, as well as progress made on establishing conditions to improve 
gender equality. It asked about specific measures adopted to improve migrant and cross-
border workers&#8217; rights to social security and decent labour conditions. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Montenegro commended Monaco for its follow-up to the previous UPR cycle and 
welcomed its continuous efforts to strengthen and promote human rights through the 
adoption of domestic legislation and consistent implementation. It asked whether Monaco 
planned to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and why the 
Criminal Code still contained provisions on defamation. Montenegro made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>33. Germany welcomed amendments to the Criminal Code concerning racially-
motivated crimes. It asked to what extent Monaco intended to modify its immigration 
policy to remove discrepancies between the treatment of Monegasque natives and 
foreigners and how it intended to adapt its labour market regulations to strengthen their 
compatibility with basic principles, such as gender equality. Germany made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. The Netherlands commended Monaco for progress made since 2009. It noted, 
however, that Monaco could improve protection against discrimination in its legislation, 
particularly protection of foreigners. It urged Monaco to ratify the Rome Statute. The 
Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Nicaragua welcomed the amendments to the legal framework, the ratification of 
additional international human rights instruments since the first review of Monaco and the 
improvements it had made to the situation of persons with disabilities. It noted, however, 
that Monaco was not member of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and stressed 
that Monaco should work harder to establish the necessary conditions to achieve the full 
enjoyment of workers&#8217; economic and social rights. Nicaragua made a recommendation. </p>


<p>GE.14-10028 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>36. Nigeria warmly welcomed the delegation of Monaco and thanked it for its active 
participation in the UPR process. It expressed appreciation for the tentative report that 
Monaco had voluntarily submitted in 2012 in response to the conclusions and 
recommendations adopted during the first review in 2009. Nigeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Oman noted that the report demonstrated the commitment of Monaco to the UPR 
and commended it for the measures it had adopted to comply with its international 
obligations, including the promotion and protection of human rights through a series of 
laws. Oman welcomed the efforts Monaco had made to strengthen its policies, particularly 
on protecting women and children from violence, and on persons with disabilities, health 
care, education and welfare. Oman made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>38. The Republic of Moldova requested information on the application of the Act on the 
prevention and punishment of specific forms of violence and on decisions issued by judicial 
authorities to protect victims. It encouraged Monaco to ensure the independence of the 
office of Minister for Appeals and Mediation. It asked whether Monaco planned to ratify 
the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and the 
Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation 
and Sexual Abuse. It invited Monaco to share its experiences in implementing UPR 
recommendations. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. Senegal praised the achievements of Monaco in strengthening the promotion and 
protection of human rights and improving the living conditions of older persons and 
persons with disabilities. It welcomed the amendment to the law on nationality allowing 
Monegasque women to transmit their nationality to their spouses. Senegal was sure that 
Monaco would take steps to prevent and raise awareness of racism and racial 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovakia appreciated the commitment of Monaco to the promotion and protection of 
human rights and the progress it had made since its last UPR cycle. Slovakia strongly 
supported the fight against impunity for perpetrators of the most serious crimes and noted 
that global ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the 
Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court was of utmost 
importance. Slovakia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>41. Referring to recommendations it had made during the first review of Monaco, 
Slovenia took note of the difficulties Monaco faced at the national level with the ratification 
of the Rome Statute and expressed the hope that it would adjust its institutional structure to 
overcome those obstacles. It noted with appreciation that, in 2012, Monaco had signed the 
Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and 
domestic violence. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Spain congratulated Monaco for its humanitarian action policies and its participation 
in various international humanitarian bodies. Noting the bill on the protection, autonomy 
and promotion of the rights and freedoms of persons with disabilities, Spain asked about 
measures adopted to promote the integration of persons with disabilities into the labour 
market and ensure their equal access to education. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Thailand welcomed the efforts Monaco had made to put voluntary pledges into 
action since its first review. It commended Monaco for the measures it had taken to 
promote women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights and to eliminate discrimination in education, as 
well as progress regarding persons with disabilities. It noted that labour legislation still 
contained distinctions concerning nationality and residence and that there was no legislation 
in place to protect the rights of foreign workers. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Togo noted that human rights had been strengthened in Monaco since its last UPR 
cycle. It commended Monaco for developments in its domestic legislation and noted that it </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.14-10028 
</p>
<p>had become a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Togo 
welcomed the measures Monaco had taken to protect children, to protect women from 
violence, and to improve the situation of persons with disabilities, and the specific 
campaigns and school programmes it had launched to combat discrimination. Togo praised 
the legislative amendment allowing women to transmit their nationality to their spouses and 
children. Togo made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Tunisia noted the progress Monaco had made in human rights since its 2009 UPR 
cycle, particularly the ratification of regional and international human rights instruments 
and the revision of laws on nationality and police custody. It also noted the commitment of 
Monaco to international development and encouraged it to increase development aid to 0.7 
per cent of its GDP. Tunisia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to international cooperation, the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted that 
the Government of Monaco sought to maintain its commitment to international solidarity 
with the most disadvantaged groups and those severely affected by conflict. Monegasque 
development cooperation activities, which were primarily targeted at the eradication of 
poverty, had been refocused in some 20 partner countries, most of them least developed 
countries.  
</p>
<p>47. Aid from Monaco provided support for some 120 development cooperation projects 
every year. Assistance was also allocated to international organizations (health, protection 
of children, human rights, environmental protection and humanitarian emergency 
assistance). 
</p><p>48. Concerning the criminalization of racist acts, he said that under Act No. 1.299 of 15 
July 2005 on freedom of public expression, any racially motivated provocation, irrespective 
of the means used, was a criminal offence. The Government of the Principality had not 
ruled out the possibility of amending the Criminal Code to make racist motivation an 
aggravating circumstance. 
</p>
<p>49. As to the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the 
Principality of Monaco had already identified several structural problems, mostly 
constitutional. However, it had already responded favourably to requests from the Court for 
judicial assistance and cooperation.  
</p><p>50. Responding to the question on defamation, he said that although it was specifically 
criminalized, that was not an obstacle to freedom of expression. The very purpose of its 
criminalization was to protect persons against defamation on account of membership in any 
given group. Freedom of expression had limits, and a balance must be found between 
freedom of expression and repression of clearly defamatory remarks. 
</p>
<p>51. On the questions regarding persons with disabilities, Monaco stressed the 
importance of the policy designed to give priority to the autonomy and normal social 
integration of persons with disabilities. It shared its good practices regarding access to 
transport, public facilities, apartments, work and education. 
</p>
<p>52. As regards the development of legislation, the delegation stated that Bill No. 893, 
mentioned earlier, was a priority for the National Council and the Government and had 
been submitted to the National Council. 
</p>
<p>53. On the subject of torture, he said that a variety of provisions in Monegasque 
domestic law covered acts of torture. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was among the legal provisions that 
judges could cite directly. No reports of acts of torture had been received recently in 
Monaco.  </p>


<p>GE.14-10028 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>54. Concerning what might appear to be discrimination in the workplace, he explained 
that the protection instituted for Monegasque nationals was justified by the unique nature of 
the Principality. The Constitution afforded priority to Monegasque citizens in access to 
public and private employment if they possessed the necessary aptitudes: when aptitudes 
were equal, then priority came into play. No preference was given on grounds of race, 
gender, colour, public opinions or social origin. The system made it possible to promote full 
employment of nationals without depriving non-nationals of the possibility of being hired. 
</p>
<p>55. Social protection was based on the notion of workplace, and there was no 
discrimination. Monegasque wage earners and foreign wage earners who were regularly 
accorded work in the Principality enjoyed the same level of protection, irrespective of their 
nationality. 
</p>
<p>56. The possibility of joining the International Labour Organization (ILO) had not been 
ruled out. The analysis in which Monaco was engaging was justified by the question of how 
the ILO principles could be reconciled with the Monegasque system of priority in 
employment and trade union rights. The same reasons had led the Government of the 
Principality to continue its study of the possibility of ratifying ILO Convention No. 11 
(1958) concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation. 
</p><p>57. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognized that human 
rights were enshrined in the Constitution and noted the fair treatment of prisoners, which 
was monitored by independent observers. It welcomed the religious freedom that was 
enjoyed in Monaco and the country&#8217;s efforts to eradicate child abuse. It was concerned that 
there was no law against sexual or gender discrimination in employment and no 
independent procedure to monitor complaints of human rights violations by the police. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. The United States of America commended Monaco for its long-standing exemplary 
human rights record, its contributions to attaining the Millennium Development Goals and 
its support to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other 
foreign aid and development assistance. It noted that Monaco had cooperated with legal 
experts from the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) 
on the formulation of an opinion on the Constitution of Monaco. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Uruguay highlighted the signature and ratification by Monaco of international 
human rights instruments, its policies to promote and protect the rights of the elderly, its 
penitentiary administration reforms and its work in the fields of persons with disabilities 
and workplace violence. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Thanking Monaco for its succinct national report, Viet Nam welcomed its 
achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights and its active contribution to 
international cooperation. Viet Nam encouraged Monaco to share its experiences and good 
practices with other countries. Recognizing that no country could claim to be a perfect 
example of human rights, Viet Nam made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Albania commended Monaco for its commitment to human rights through effective 
measures and an extensive legal and administrative human rights framework, notably 
regarding the rights of vulnerable people. Albania looked forward to the adoption of the bill 
on the protection, autonomy and promotion of the rights and freedoms of persons with 
disabilities and the ratification by Monaco of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The establishment of the office of Minister for Appeals and Mediation would 
promote fairness and transparency. Albania made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Commending Monaco for its efforts to promote human rights, Algeria noted its 
amendments to several laws, especially on the right to nationality and on eradicating crimes 
against children. It welcomed the signature and ratification of several international </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-10028 
</p>
<p>instruments, including the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention 
against Discrimination in Education. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Morocco noted the adoption of new laws on criminal procedure, the right to 
nationality, crimes and offences against children and the protection of women against 
violence. It applauded Monaco for its continued provision of international assistance to 
disadvantaged groups and the compulsory study of human rights in schools. The relevant 
legislative measures could be shared as good practice. Commending Monaco on the 
measures it had taken to support persons with disabilities, Morocco noted the signature of 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Australia welcomed the priority that had been given to human rights issues since the 
first review of Monaco. It commended Monaco for its progress in implementing the 
recommendations from that review, including its signature of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities. It encouraged Monaco to actively consider ways of aligning its 
legislation with the obligations of signatories, with a view to ratification. Australia made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>65. Brazil noted with satisfaction that, in line with the recommendations from its first 
review, Monaco has acceded to the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. Brazil 
congratulated Monaco on its accession to the Convention against Discrimination in 
Education and noted the establishment of the Ministry for Appeals and Mediation. The 
absence in the Criminal Code of a definition of torture in line with article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture remained a matter of concern. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Canada welcomed the steps Monaco had taken to strengthen capacity to address 
violence against women, children and other vulnerable persons by adopting new legislation 
and creating a specialized institution to care for children and women in need. Canada 
wished to know what progress had been made to encourage the participation of women in 
the Government Council and what measures would be implemented. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Chile commended Monaco for its adoption of various human rights laws and its 
signature and ratification of major international human rights instruments. It highlighted 
policies and measures aimed at protecting the elderly. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. China noted with appreciation the efforts Monaco had made to improve its 
legislative framework and the measures it had introduced to protect the rights of vulnerable 
groups, namely women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly. China appreciated 
its cooperation with developing countries and the official development assistance it 
provided. Bearing in mind the recommendations of the European Commission against 
Racism and Intolerance, China asked whether Monaco intended to take additional measures 
to strengthen its fight against racism. 
</p>
<p>69. The Congo commended Monaco for the action it had taken to strengthen human 
rights, particularly the new laws it had adopted on criminal procedure, the right to 
nationality, specific forms of violence and crimes and offences against children. It noted the 
steps Monaco had taken to support persons with disabilities and to prevent violence against 
women and children. It applauded Monaco for its international commitment to combating 
poverty, centred around maternal and child health and pandemics. The Congo made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>70. Costa Rica took note of progress made since the previous review of Monaco, which 
reflected its commitment towards the promotion and protection of human rights. It took 
note with appreciation of the amendments Monaco had made to its domestic legislation on 
transferring nationality, thus putting an end to practices which discriminated against </p>


<p>GE.14-10028 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>women. It acknowledged awareness-raising campaigns on discrimination and commended 
Monaco for its ratification of international instruments. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Cuba recognized the efforts Monaco had made and the results it had achieved in 
implementing the recommendations it had accepted from the first UPR cycle. It 
commended Monaco for the progress it had made in various areas, such as the protection of 
the rights of persons with disabilities, and of women and children. It noted, however, that 
Monaco also faced challenges in the area of human rights. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Ecuador congratulated Monaco on its efforts to implement recommendations from 
its first review and recognized the initiatives it had implemented on human rights training 
and awareness-raising for judges and the police. It welcomed the legislative changes 
Monaco had made on criminal procedure, crimes against children and violence against 
women. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Estonia noted with appreciation that Monaco had become a party to core 
international human rights instruments and was cooperating fully with special procedures 
and treaty bodies. It acknowledged that human rights were part of domestic policy in 
Monaco and welcomed its implementation of previous recommendations, such as the 
adoption of legislation on the prevention and punishment of specific forms of violence. It 
noted efforts regarding gender equality and called on Monaco to prohibit corporal 
punishment and to punish domestic violence. It also encouraged Monaco to decriminalize 
defamation. Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. France welcomed the commitment Monaco had shown to human rights since the 
first UPR cycle, particularly with regard to the rights of persons with disabilities and the 
provision of international development assistance. It asked whether Monaco planned to 
implement a national strategy in order to apply the Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Argentina congratulated Monaco on its ratification of international instruments, 
including the Convention against Discrimination in Education, and its accession to the 
Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. It noted the efforts Monaco had made to fully 
integrate persons with disabilities and the adoption of legislation on the prevention and 
punishment of specific forms of violence. It encouraged Monaco to continue taking action 
to improve the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Indonesia welcomed the commitment of Monaco to human rights and noted that it 
had strengthened its policies to protect women, children and persons with disabilities, 
including by developing domestic legislation related to the ratification of the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It welcomed the establishment of the office of 
Minister for Appeals and Mediation. It thanked Monaco for its unwavering commitment to 
international cooperation in maternal and child health, pandemics, neglected diseases, 
education and gender equality. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Concerning women in the administration, the head of the delegation said that the 
majority of senior posts were occupied by women. 
</p><p>78. With respect to ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which Monaco had signed in 2007, the head of the 
delegation said that some of its provisions seemed incompatible with the provisions of 
Monegasque law. Nevertheless, Monaco was continuing its consideration of the matter. 
</p>
<p>79. Concerning the suggestions of the European Commission for Democracy through 
Law (Venice Commission) on bringing Monaco&#8217;s laws on the functioning of the National 
Council into line with its actual practices, he said that Parliament was studying a timetable 
for doing precisely that. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-10028 
</p>
<p>80. There was no problem from the legal point of view with registering a complaint 
against police officers who committed violations of human rights. The police, including the 
members of the criminal investigation department, were supervised by the Public 
Prosecutor. There was also a special service responsible for investigating offences allegedly 
committed by police officers. The service reported directly to the Ministry of State and was 
in no way subordinate to the Commissioner of Police. 
</p>
<p>81. Concerning the Venice Commission&#8217;s recommendations on legal matters, he said 
that the administration of justice was independent of and not linked to the Government. Act 
No. 1.398 of 25 June 2013 had completed the process begun with the 2009 reform of the 
regulations governing the judiciary, under which an oversight body for the judiciary, the 
High Council of the Judiciary, had been set up. 
</p>
<p>82. With regard to domestic violence, Monaco had adopted the law on the prevention 
and punishment of specific forms of violence and had organized training on assistance to 
victims for judges, court registrars, social workers and police officers. 
</p><p>83. Monaco monitored the detention of convicted persons who were serving their 
sentences in France, including by such measures as pardon or parole that were exclusively 
within its competence. It was about to finalize an agreement with France whereby a 
Monegasque judge would make periodic visits to the prisons concerned to check that 
detention conditions were in line with the standards prevailing in Monaco.  
</p>
<p>84. Concerning illegitimate funding, the delegation emphasized that Monaco provided 
effective judicial cooperation, irrespective of whether or not there was an international 
agreement with the requesting State. The Principality cooperated based on the principle of 
reciprocity and provided assistance to the various international bodies that were combating 
money laundering. Consideration was being given to setting up an agency to manage and 
administer all the funds that had been frozen by the Monegasque authorities. 
</p>
<p>85. He announced that in early 2014, the post of High Commissioner for the protection 
of rights and freedoms and mediation had been established.  
</p>
<p>86. He indicated that Wages Act No. 739 of 16 March 1963 guaranteed gender equality 
in remuneration and rendered null and void any regulation that discriminated between men 
and women in terms of remuneration. The only discrimination that existed was positive 
discrimination, in the sense that there were legislative provisions that offered enhanced 
protection to women and young people. 
</p>
<p>87. There was no differentiation in the Principality of Monaco among Monegasque 
wage earners; the rules for employers and employees were applicable to all employers and 
all employees without distinction as to race, religion, nationality, colour or gender. 
</p>
<p>88. The head of the delegation concluded by stating that Monaco would continue to 
work at both the national and international levels for the protection of the most 
disadvantaged groups; he reaffirmed Monaco&#8217;s commitment to the United Nations and 
support for the universal periodic review mechanism.
