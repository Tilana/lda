D. Risk Factors
This annual report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or Rockwell's future
performance, including its future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements  by  terminology  such  as  "may",  "should",  "expects",  "plans",  "anticipates",  "believes",
"estimates",  "predicts",  or  "potential"  or  the  negative  of  these  terms  or  other  comparable  terminology.
These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors,  including  the  risks  in  enumerated  in  this  section  entitled  "Risk  Factors",  that  may  cause
Rockwell's or the mining industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by these forward-looking statements.
– Page 4 –
While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in
good faith and reflect Rockwell's current judgment regarding the direction of its business, actual results
will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions
or  other  future  performance  suggested  in  this  annual  report.  Except  as  required  by  applicable  law,
including the securities laws of the United States, Rockwell does not intend to update any of the forward-
looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
An  investment  in  Rockwell's  common  stock  involves  a  number  of  very  significant  risks.  The  investor
should  carefully  consider  the  following  risks  and  uncertainties  in  addition  to  other  information  in  this
annual report in evaluating Rockwell and its business before purchasing shares of Rockwell's common
stock. Rockwell's business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to
any of the following risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing Rockwell. Additional
risks not presently known to Rockwell may also impair its business operations. The investor could lose
all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.
Risks Associated With Mining
– Page 5 –
There is no assurance that Rockwell can formally establish the existence of any mineral reserve
on  any  of  its  properties.  Until  Rockwell  is  able  to  establish  a  mineral  reserve,  there  can  be  no
assurance  that  production  from  these  properties  will  continue  for  any  period  of  time  and  if
production fails, Rockwell's business may ultimately fail.
Although  Rockwell  now  owns  and  operates  properties  with  a  history  of  sporadic  to  regular  diamond
production,  which  have  been  subject  to  examination,  testing  and  quantification  through  scientific
exploration techniques, a reliable determination of grade is difficult in alluvial deposits. Accordingly, there
is no assurance that Rockwell can formally establish the existence of any mineral reserve on any of its
properties.  A  mineral  reserve  is  defined  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  its  Industry
Guide 
at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/forms/industry.htm#secguide7)  as  that  part  of  a  mineral  deposit
which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
The  probability  of  an  individual  prospect  ever  having  a  "reserve"  that  meets  the  requirements  of  the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission's  Industry  Guide  7  is  remote.  If  none  of  our  current  or  future
mineral resource properties contains any "reserve," any funds that Rockwell spends on exploration will
be lost.

Even if Rockwell discovers a mineral reserve, there can be no assurance that the related property
will be developed.
Even if Rockwell eventually discovers a mineral reserve on one or more of its properties, there can be no
assurance that it will be able to develop the properties into producing mines. Both mineral exploration
and  development  involve  a  high  degree  of  risk  and  few  properties  which  are  explored  are  ultimately
developed into producing mines.
The commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including,
by  way  of  example,  the  size,  grade  and  other  attributes  of  the  mineral  deposit,  the  proximity  of  the
resource to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads and a point for shipping, government regulation and
market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond Rockwell's control, and any of them could increase
costs and make extraction of any identified mineral resource unprofitable.
Mineral  operations  are  subject  to  applicable  law  and  government  regulation.  Even  if  Rockwell
discovers a mineral resource in a commercially exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations
could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of that mineral resource. If Rockwell cannot exploit any
mineral resource that it might discover on our properties, its business may fail.
Both mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial and
local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with respect to
prospecting,  mine  development,  mineral  production,  transport,  export,  taxation,  labor  standards,
occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety
and other matters. There can be no assurance that Rockwell will be able to obtain or maintain any of the
permits  required  for  the  continued  exploration  of  its  mineral  properties  or  for  the  construction  and
operation of a mine on its properties at economically viable costs. If Rockwell cannot accomplish these
objectives, our business could fail.
Rockwell believes that it is in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to its
activities but there can be no assurance that it can continue to do so. Current laws and regulations could
be amended and the Company might not be able to comply with them, as amended. Further, there can be
no  assurance  that  Rockwell  will  be  able  to  obtain  or  maintain  all  permits  necessary  for  our  future
operations, or that it will be able to obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are
required  and  are  not  obtained,  Rockwell  may  be  delayed  or  prohibited  from  proceeding  with  planned
exploration or development of its mineral properties.
– Page 6 –
In  addition,  environmental  hazards  unknown  to  Rockwell  which  have  been  caused  by  previous  or
existing owners or operators of the properties may exist on the properties in which Rockwell holds an
interest.  Even  if  Rockwell  relinquishes  its  licenses,  it  will  still  remain  responsible  for  any  required
reclamation and rehabilitation of the properties.
Mineral exploration and development are subject to particular operating risks. Rockwell does not
currently insure against these risks. In the event of a cave-in or similar occurrence, Rockwell's
liability may exceed its resources, which would have an adverse impact on Rockwell.
All  Rockwell’s  operations  are  shallow  opencast  which  has  an  inherently  lower  risk  than  other  deeper
operations which are susceptible to cave-ins.
Mineral  exploration,  development  and  production  involve  many  risks  which  even  a  combination  of
experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Hazards such as unusual or
unexpected formations and other conditions are involved.
Rockwell's operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks inherent in the exploration, development
and production of resources, including liability for pollution, cave-ins or similar hazards against which it
cannot insure against or which it may elect not to insure. Any such event could result in work stoppages
and  damage  to  property,  including  damage  to  the  environment.  Rockwell  applies  international  best
practices  principles  in  all  areas  of  the  operations  and  complies  with  all  health,  safety  and  mining
legislation of the South African Republic. Rockwell does not currently maintain any insurance coverage
against these operating hazards. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence may
have a material, adverse impact on Rockwell.
The prediction of grade can be more challenging for the type of deposit which the Company is
exploiting.
In the case of alluvial diamond deposits, the prediction of grade can be challenging due to the inherent
geological nature of such deposits. The alluvial diamonds are laid down by rivers flowing over uneven
terrain  and  the  diamonds  vary  in  terms  of  size  and  quality.  Individual  diamonds  are  not  evenly  or
uniformly distributed through out an alluvial deposit; neither are they randomly distributed. Rather, their
distribution  has  been  described  as  a  random  distribution  of  clusters  of  points.  The  clusters  are  both
randomly distributed in space, and the point density of the cluster is also random. In order to determine
grade under such circumstances it is necessary  to  process  large  volumes  of  material  (bulk  testing)  in
order to be sure that grade calculations are representative and accurate. Moreover, in the case of such
deposits, drilling is only of use in the determination of gravel distribution and not diamond content, since
the  volume  of  material  recovered  is  insufficiently  representative  of  grade.  Notwithstanding  the  above
caution, bulk testing is a straightforward technique that is currently being applied across all of Rockwell's
South  African  operations.  Furthermore,  size  frequency  distribution  curves  can  be  used  to  accurately
predict the relative abundance of diamonds in terms of stone size, thus mitigating risk.
Mineral prices are subject to dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations.
Rockwell expects to derive revenues from the extraction and sale of diamonds. The prices of diamonds
have fluctuated widely in recent years, and are affected by numerous factors beyond Rockwell's control
including  international,  economic  and  political  trends,  expectations  of  inflation,  currency  exchange
fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumptive patterns, speculative activities and increased
production due to new extraction developments and improved extraction and production methods. The
effect of these factors on the price of diamonds and base metals, and, therefore, the economic viability of
any of Rockwell's projects, cannot accurately be predicted.
– Page 7 –
The mining industry is highly competitive and there is no assurance that Rockwell will continue to
be successful in acquiring mineral claims. If Rockwell cannot continue to acquire properties to
explore for mineral resources, it may be required to reduce or cease operations.
The  mineral  exploration,  development,  and  production  industry  is  largely  unintegrated.  Rockwell
competes with other exploration companies looking for mineral resource properties and the resources
that  can  be  produced  from  them.  However,  the  mining  business  operates  in  a  worldwide  market,  and
prices for minerals are derived from relatively pure market forces. Accordingly, competition to sell any
metals or concentrates produced should not be an issue if metals prices warrant production
Rockwell competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities.
This competition could adversely affect Rockwell's ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in
the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Rockwell will acquire any interest in additional
mineral resource properties that might yield reserves or result in commercial mining operations.
Risks Related to Rockwell
The recoverability of the amounts shown for the Company’s mineral property interests, property, plant and
equipment  and  inventory  is  dependent  upon  the  existence  of  economically  recoverable  mineral
resources and future profitable production or proceeds from the disposition of the mine. The Company’s
continuing operations are also dependent upon the discovery and existence of economically recoverable
mineral reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete the exploration
and development of its mineral property interests, and upon future profitable production or proceeds from
the disposition of its mineral property interests.
Rockwell requires additional financing in order to continue in business as a going concern, the
availability of which is uncertain.
The Company and its subsidiaries incurred losses  of  $13  million  during  the  year  ended  February  28,
2009 and continue to incur losses subsequent to year end. Costs have reduced substantially, however
sales  are  irregular.  The  risk  that  the  cash  and  near  cash  resources  will  not  be  sufficient  to  fund  the
continuing losses up to break-even indicates that a material uncertainty exists which may cast substantial
doubt on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to continue as a going concern. Based on the
following, the directors believe that the Company and its subsidiaries will continue as going concerns for
the year ahead:
At year end the Company’s current assets exceeded its current liabilities by $0.6 million and the
Company’s total assets exceeded its total liabilities by $70.4 million.
The cash flow forecasts for the year ahead indicate that additional funds of $4 million will be
required to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to continue as a going concern. The additional
funding was calculated on the assumption that volumes remain constant with current production,
with the new plant still operating at below 50% capacity, prices remain at current depressed levels
which are 55% below pre crisis levels and the South African Rand remains at current levels.
The directors have already commenced with plans to raise finance, and the following plans have been
considered to raise these funds:

The directors have started the process towards exercising either a rights offering or a private placement,
and have identified and communicated with current investors and potential new investors to ensure that
the desired investment is raised.
Despite the current economic challenges the directors believe that the Company will be successful in
raising the additional funding as and when it will be required. The directors will be able to raise up to 25%
of market capital before seeking shareholders approval, which will raise up to $4.1 million.
Some of Rockwell's directors and officers serve on the boards of other exploration companies,
which could potentially give rise to conflicts of interest.
Some of Rockwell's directors and officers are engaged, and will continue to be engaged, in the search for
additional business opportunities on their own behalf and on behalf of other companies. Situations may
arise where these directors and officers will be in direct competition with Rockwell. Conflicts, if any, will
be  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the Business  Corporations  Act (British
Columbia) and applicable law.
The loss of any of Rockwell's key management employees could have a material adverse effect on
Rockwell's business.
The  nature  of  Rockwell's  business  and  Rockwell's  ability  to  continue  its  exploration  activities  and  to
exploit any mineral reserves that it may find in the future depends, in large part, on Rockwell's ability to
attract and maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and
there can be no assurance that Rockwell will be able to attract and retain such personnel. Rockwell's
development now and in the future will depend on the efforts of key management figures, such as John
W. Bristow, Rockwell's Chief Executive Officer, and Desmond Morgan, Chief Financial Officer. The loss
of any of these key people could have a material adverse effect on Rockwell's business. Rockwell does
not currently maintain key-man life insurance on any of its key employees.
Rockwell's properties are located in the Republic of South Africa
All mineral properties are located in the Republic of South Africa. Exploration initiatives in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (the “DRC”) and Chile have been discontinued due to varying degrees by political
instability and economic uncertainties.
Operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to restrictions on
production, repatriation of profits, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriations or property,
environmental legislation and mine safety.
South Africa has undergone major constitutional changes to effect majority rule, and also to effect mineral
title.  Accordingly,  many  laws  may  be  considered  relatively  new,  resulting  in  risks  such  as  possible
misinterpretation  of  new  laws,  modification  of  mining  or  exploration  rights,  operating  restrictions,
increased taxes, environmental regulation, mine safety and other risks arising out of a new sovereignty
over mining, Rockwell's operations may also be affected in varying degrees by political and economic
instability, terrorism, crime, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation.
– Page 9 –
South  African  government  empowerment  initiatives  may  adversely  affect  Rockwell's  ability  to
obtain or maintain permits and licenses for mining rights in South Africa.
In  order  to  address  inequalities  to  Historically  Disadvantaged  Persons  ("HDP")  engendered  by  South
Africa's  former  apartheid  system,  the  South  African  Government  has  initiated  certain  government
empowerment initiatives.
In October 2002, the South African government enacted the Mineral Development Act that deals with the
state's policy towards the future of ownership of minerals rights and the procedures for conducting mining
transactions  in  South  Africa.  The  Mineral  Development  Act  is  a  statute  with  wide-ranging  objectives,
including  sustainable  development  and  the  promotion  of  equitable  access  to  South  Africa's  mineral
wealth by the inclusion of HDP into the industry. The Mineral Development Act came into effect in May
2004.  The  South  African  government  has  stated  that,  under  the  Mineral  Development  Act,  it  will  be
issuing  permits  and  licenses  for  prospecting  and  mining  rights  to  applicants  using  a  "scorecard"
approach. Applicants will need to demonstrate their eligibility for consideration based upon the number of
credits accumulated in terms of quantifiable ownership transformation criteria, such as employment equity
and human resource development.
Future amendments to, and interpretations of, the economic empowerment initiatives by the South African
government and the South African courts could adversely affect the business of Rockwell and its results
of operations and its financial condition.
Absence of dividends
Rockwell has paid no dividends on its shares since incorporation, and does not anticipate doing so in the
foreseeable future.
Rockwell is subject to potentially volatile exchange rate fluctuations
Rockwell conducts operations in currencies other than Canadian dollars. Of particular significance is the
fact that Rockwell’s operations in South Africa are almost entirely paid for in South African Rand, which
has historically devalued against the United States dollar, but which recently has shown unexpected and
substantial strength against most major world currencies, including the United States dollar. The strength
in the South African Rand, if it continues, will negatively impact the potential profitability of Rockwell’s
mining operations.
Rockwell expects to be a passive foreign investment company, which could have consequences
for U.S. investors.
Potential  investors  who  are  U.S.  taxpayers  should  be  aware  that  Rockwell  expects  to  be  a  passive
foreign investment company ("PFIC") for the current fiscal year, that it may also have been a PFIC in prior
years, and that it may also be a PFIC in subsequent years. If Rockwell is a PFIC for any year during a
U.S. taxpayer's holding period, then such U.S. taxpayer generally will be required to treat any so-called
"excess distribution" received on its common shares, or any gain realized upon a disposition of common
shares, as ordinary income and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such distribution or gain, unless
the taxpayer makes a qualified electing fund ("QEF") election or a mark-to-market election with respect to
the shares of Rockwell. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed
the amount of the excess distribution received, or the amount of proceeds of disposition realized, by the
taxpayer. A U.S. taxpayer who makes a QEF election generally must report on a current basis its share of
Rockwell's net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which Rockwell is a PFIC, whether or
not Rockwell distributes any amounts to its shareholders.
– Page 10 –
Rockwell's stock is a penny stock. Trading of Rockwell's stock may be restricted by the SEC's
penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell Rockwell's stock.
Because  the  market  price  for  Rockwell's  shares  is  less  than  US$5.00,  its  securities  are  classified  as
"penny stock". For transactions involving a penny stock, brokers or dealers are required to approve a
previous account for penny stock transactions, which involves obtaining financial information concerning
the  investor  and  satisfying  themselves  that  the  investor  has  sufficient  knowledge  and  experience  to
evaluate the risks associated with penny stock. The broker or dealer must also deliver certain information
to investors on penny stock, including disclosure concerning the risks associated with penny stock, and
must receive a written agreement from investors prior to the transactions. As a result of the penny stock
restrictions, brokers or potential investors may be reluctant to trade in Rockwell's securities, which may
result in less liquidity for Rockwell's stock.
NASD  sales  practice  requirements  may  limit  a  stockholder's  ability  to  buy  and  sell  Rockwell's
stock.
In  addition  to  the  "penny  stock"  rules  promulgated  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (see
above for discussions of penny stock rules), the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) has
adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have
reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending
speculative  low  priced  securities  to  their  non-institutional  customers,  broker-dealers  must  make
reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  information  about  the  customer's  financial  status,  tax  status,  investment
objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the NASD believes that there is a
high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The
NASD  requirements  make  it  more  difficult  for  broker-dealers  to  recommend  that  their  customers  buy
Rockwell common stock, which may limit the ability to buy and sell Rockwell stock and have an adverse
effect on the market for Rockwell shares.
Rockwell  has  a  number  of  outstanding  share  purchase  options  and  warrants,  the  exercise  of
which could result in equity dilution.
At  February  28,  2009,  Rockwell  had  a  significant  number  of  share  purchase  options  (7,956,168)  and
warrants (161,379,154). On May 9 2009, 121,779,154 share purchase warrants expired with the balance
remaining on May 31 2009 being 39,600,000 exercisable at $1.00 per share expiring on November 28
2009. If exercised could likely act as an upside damper on the trading price range of Rockwell's shares.
The  underlying  shares  issuable  upon  exercise  of  these  securities  represent  approximately  20%  of
Rockwell's currently issued shares.

2.
The legal name of the Registrant is "Rockwell Diamonds Inc."
 
Rockwell was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) (the predecessor legislation
to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia)) on November 10, 1988 under the name
"Annabel Gold Mines Inc."
 
The Company changed its name to "Carissa Mining Corporation" on January 24, 1994. On October
26, 1995, the Company changed its name to "Rockwell Ventures Inc.", consolidated its share
capital on the basis of five shares to one and subsequently increased its authorized share capital to
200,000,000 Common Shares without par value.
4. On December 29, 2004, Rockwell increased its authorized share capital to consist of an unlimited

number of Common Shares without par value.
 
At the Company's Annual and Extraordinary General Meeting held on November 28, 2005, the
Company's shareholders approved the creation of a class of preferred shares and the consolidation
of the Company's Common Shares on a four old shares for one new basis. Regulatory approval of
this capital reorganization was received on January 27, 2006.
 
The Company changed its name from "Rockwell Ventures Inc." on May 14, 2007 to "Rockwell
Diamonds Inc."
 
The principal events in the development of Rockwell's business are:
(i)
In June 2006, Rockwell entered into an agreement to acquire (the "Durnpike Acquisition") all of
the  shares  and  loans  in Durnpike  Investments  (Pty)  Limited  ("Durnpike"),  a  private  South
African company, from eight arm's length individuals (the "Vendors"), for consideration payable
in the common shares of Rockwell ("Common Shares") on specified dates described in Item B.
Business  Overview  –  Alluvial Diamond  Properties below.  Durnpike  held  an  interest  and/or
rights  in four alluvial diamond properties in South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. These were:
Holpan/Klipdam Property in South Africa ("RSA or "South Africa")
Wouterspan Property in South Africa
Galputs Mineral Project in South Africa.
Kwango River Project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC")
On  January  31,  2007,  all  the  conditions  precedent  to implementation  of  the  Durnpike
Acquisition were fulfilled. The Company also received the necessary regulatory approvals in
Canada and South Africa.
(ii) As a result of the acquisition of Durnpike, the Company assumed the option to purchase the
Makoenskloof property.
– Page 12 –
(iii) On March 6, 2007, the Company and Trans Hex Group Limited (“Trans Hex”) entered into a
conditional  agreement  whereby  the  Company’s wholly  owned  South  African  subsidiary,
Rockwell  Resources  RSA  (Pty)  Ltd. (“Rockwell  RSA”),  would  acquire  through  Trans  Hex’s
wholly-owned subsidiary,  Trans  Hex  Operations  (Pty)  Ltd.  (“THO”),  two  open  pit  alluvial
diamond  mines,  namely  Saxendrift  and  Niewejaarskraal,  and 
three  alluvial diamond
exploration  projects,  namely  Kwartelspan,  Zwemkuil-  Mooidraai  and Remhoogte-Holsloot,
which are located along the southern bank of the Middle Orange River in the Northern Cape
Province of South Africa (“Northern Cape”) and which are collectively referred to as the Middle
Orange River Operations and Projects (or “MORO”). The agreement included:
the rights to prospect, explore and/or mine precious stones and/or other minerals and/or
metals held directly or indirectly by THO in the Saxendrift area of the Northern Cape;
 
a series of large remnant alluvial diamond terraces;
 
the plant, machinery, equipment and other movable assets owned and/or used by THO;
 
certain employees of THO; and
 
a rehabilitation liability which will be taken over by the Company.
In  April  2008  the  Company  completed  the  MORO  acquisition,  including  registration  and  transfer  of
Saxendrift Mine Pty (Ltd) and the Saxendrift mining right, as well as prospecting rights in respect of the
Kwartelspan, Zwemkuil-Mooidraai and part of the Remhoogte-Holsloot projects.
As  at  February  28,  2009,  the  Company  was  committed  to  pay  Trans  Hex  for  the  acquisition  of  the
remaining Niewejaarskraal mining rights and thus complete the MORO acquisition. The Company had
placed $2.7 million in trust toward application of the remaining payment, to be released to Trans Hex
upon the anticipated grant of Ministerial Consent to the cession of each of the Outstanding Mining Rights
to the Company and registration of cession of such rights in its name.
On April 11, 2009 all the conditions precedent were met and the Company paid ZAR 18.9 million ($2.6
million) in cash to Trans Hex for the remaining Niewejaarskraal mining rights of which ZAR 16.5 million
($2.0  million)  was  capitalized.  This  action  completed  the  Saxendrift/Remhoogte-Holsloot  transaction
negotiated during April 2008. The Company has no further commitments in relation to more acquisitions.
The  results  of  the  Saxendrift  operations  have  been  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements
since  the  date  of  acquisition  on  April  11,  2008.  The  following  table  summarizes  the  total  purchase
consideration of the Saxendrift assets:

The allocation of purchase price is based on management’s estimates of the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, April 2008.
 
Effective July 1, 2008, a Black Economic Empowerment (“BEE”) company Liberty Lane Investments
(Pty)  Ltd,  part  of  the  African Vanguard group, acquired a shareholding of 26% by subscribing for
shares in Saxendrift. The acquisition was financed by Rockwell Resources RSA (Pty) Ltd and will
therefore  only  result  in  a  reduction  of  shareholding  to 74%  once  the  loan  is  paid.  The  Company
continues  to  maintain  good  standing with its BEE partner and is operating under the terms of its
BEE agreement, including the appointment of a director to its Board.
 
Rockwell's  principal  capital  expenditures  and  exploration expenditures  in  the  fiscal  years  ended
February 28, 2009, May 31, 2007, and nine months ended February 29, 2008 are as follows:

The Company held a 100% interest in the Ricardo Property, a copper prospect located within the Calama
Mining  District,  Chile  that  it  acquired  in  1998.  Exploration  was  carried  out  by  two  companies  who
optioned  the  property  in  2000  and  2004.  Since  that  time,  Rockwell  has  sought  partners  to  continue
exploration  or  to  divest  of  the  property.  In  July  2008,  the  Ricardo  property  was  acquired  by  Hunter
Dickinson Acquisitions Inc., a company with certain directors and officers in common with Rockwell. No
significant divestitures have occurred in the years presented.

No principal capital expenditures are currently anticipated for the ensuing year.

10. Pala Takeover bid - September 9, 2008
On  September  9,2008,  Pala  Investment  limited  (“Pala”),  a Swiss  based  investment  fund  with  a
significant shareholding holding (approximately 17%) in Rockwell through its indirect wholly- owned
subsidiary 0833824 B.C. Ltd., made an unsolicited offer to purchase all of the outstanding common
shares of Rockwell for $0.36 per share.
 
In response to the offer, the Board of Directors established a special committee of its independent
directors. The special committee, assisted by its independent financial and legal advisors, carefully
reviewed  and  considered  all  aspects  of  Pala’s  offer  and,  based on  that  review,  unanimously
recommended  that  Rockwell  shareholders  should reject  the  offer  as  it  fell  significantly  short  of
providing fair value.
 
The Board of Directors’ rejected the bid for following key reasons:
The offer significantly undervalued Rockwell’s asses and growth potential;
The Special Committee’s independent financial advisor had determined that the consideration
under the Offer was inadequate, from a financial point of view, to Shareholders;
The Offer was highly conditional; and
The timing of the offer was opportunistic
Following concerted efforts by Pala to mobilize existing and new shareholders to accept its offer,
Pala withdrew its hostile bid in November 3, 2008, thereby ending the hostile bid process that they
had initiated on September 9, 2008.
 
This permitted Rockwell, and its Directors and Management to proceed with the normal business of
the Company.
 
Pala request for a special general meeting – April 29, 2009
 
In a further effort to take control of Rockwell following their previous hostile bid process for Rockwell,
Pala announced on April 29, 2009 that it had called a Special General Meeting (the “meeting”) of the
common shareholders of Rockwell to be held on June 17th, 2009, in Vancouver British Columbia,
Canada.
 
Pala  proposed  three  resolutions  to  be  passed  by Shareholders  at  the  meeting.  The  three
Resolutions were as follows:
1.
2.
3.
To consider and, if deemed advisable, to pass a special resolution of the shareholders to
remove all the directors of the Company, in particular David Copeland (chairman), Mark
Bristow, and John Bristow
 
To elect new directors of the Company in place of the removed directors comprising: of
Marthinus  Von  Wielligh,  Phillip  Reynolds, Sandile  Zungu,  Hennie  van  Wyk,  William
Fisher, Terrence Janes, and Greg Radke.
 
To amend and then terminate the Company’s Shareholder Rights Plan Agreement
– Page 15 –
In  response  to  the  Pala  call  for  the  Meeting,  The  Executive  Directors  of  Rockwell  comprising  David
Copeland, John Bristow, and Mark Bristow issued a circular opposing the Pala Circular and presenting
four Resolutions for the Meeting as follows:
1.
2.
 
3.
 
4.
 
5.
That  the  shareholders  (“they”)  vote  against  Pala’s proposal to remove any or all of the
current directors from office.
 
That the they vote against Pala’s proposal to amend and then terminate the
 
Shareholder Rights Plan.
 
That shareholders vote to support a fair rights offering.
 
That shareholders vote for the denying Pala its expenses for requisitioning, calling and
holding the meeting.
At the Special General Meeting held in Vancouver on June 17th, 2009, counsel advised that Resolution
#3 be removed from the meeting and vote count, and following the collation of the results it emerged that
all of the proposals put forward by Pala were rejected by shareholder vote. Approximately 74% of the
Company’s issued and outstanding votes were voted by proxy at this meeting, and in summary 57.33% of
these shareholders voted against the removal of one or more of the current Directors, 62.0% voted to
continue the Shareholder Rights Plan, and 57.14% voted to direct Rockwell not to reimburse Pala costs
associated with the Meeting.
Given  the  outcome  of  the  votes  cast  by  Shareholders  at  the  Meeting  Pala’s  proposal  to  remove  the
incumbent Directors and Management of Rockwell was convincingly defeated and the Company and its
Directors thus received a strong mandate to continue with the management of the Company’s business.
Subsequent  to  this  meeting  Terence  Janes  and  Greg  Radke,  Pala’s  representatives  on  the  Rockwell
board, resigned from the Board of Rockwell.
B. Business Overview
Durnpike Agreement
On June 30, 2006, the Company entered into an Agreement-in-Principle to acquire interests and/or rights
in  the  Holpan/Klipdam  Property  in  South  Africa,  Wouterspan  Property  in  South  Africa,  Kwango  River
Project  in  the  DRC  and  Galputs  Minerale  Project  in  South  Africa.  Pursuant  to  the  terms  of  a
comprehensive agreement, (“the Definitive Agreement”), the Company acquired all of the shares in and
claims on shareholder’s loan account of Durnpike, a private South African company, from eight vendors
(the “Vendors”). Some of the underlying rights were held by the H Van Wyk Diamonds (“HVWD”) and Van
Wyk Trust, collectively the Van Wyk Diamond Group (“VWDG”). For further details on these see the Notes
to the Financial Statements.
Pursuant to the Definitive Agreement:
The Company acquired from the Vendors all of their shares in and claims on loan account against
Durnpike for consideration of ZAR 39.8 million ($6.1 million), payable in common shares of the
Company on the earlier of (i) the date of the JSE listing; and (ii) within approximately 12 months
from signature of the Definitive Agreement. By virtue of such acquisition, the Company acquired
Durnpike’s interests in the four alluvial diamond properties in South Africa. The ZAR consideration
did not include payment in respect of the Kwango River Project, which payment stood to be made
by the Company only when (and if) the feasibility study referred to below has been completed and
approved by the board of directors of the Company.
On November 30, 2007, the Company began trading on the JSE and hence completed its JSE
listing condition. Consequently, the Company issued 7,848,663 Common Shares as settlement of
its commitment and also 1,676,529 Common Shares as finder fees relating to the Durnpike
acquisition.
– Page 16 –
Durnpike’s interest in the Kwango River Project was constituted by an agreement concluded in
2006 (“Midamines Agreement”) with Midamines SPRL (“Midamines”), the holder of the exploration
permit on the Kwango River Project, to act as contractor on behalf of Midamines to manage and
carry out exploration and mining. Durnpike was entitled to an 80% share of the net revenue from the
sale of any diamonds produced from the contract area.
Under the Midamines Agreement, Durnpike agreed to certain minimum royalty payments being
made to Midamines, and Midamines undertook several obligations in favour of Durnpike including
that of procuring and facilitating Durnpike’s access to the Kwango River Project site. The royalties
took the form of a series of recurring annual minimum royalty payments of US$1,200,000 per annum
(commencing on December 31, 2007). During 2008, pursuant to an amending agreement to the
Midamines Agreement, the Company paid consideration of $600,000 to Midamines in order to
increase the size of the concession (Permit 331). As part of such amending agreement Midamines
waived its right to payment of the abovementioned US$1,200,000 royalty payment on 31 December
2007. Subsequently, and pursuant to Midamines’ persistent breach of material provisions of the
Midamines Agreement (coupled with its failure to remedy such instances of breach notwithstanding
notice to do so), Durnpike cancelled the Midamines Agreement and claimed damages.
Midamines has subsequently disputed Durnpike’s entitlement to cancel the Midamines Agreement
and has demanded payment of US$1.2 million as well as other amounts which have not yet been
particularized. Midamines has threatened to refer the dispute to arbitration and to joint Rockwell as
party thereto, but no formal referral to arbitration has as yet been forthcoming.
As provided for in the Definitive Agreement, the Company executed an agreement in relation to the
acquisition of control of the mineral rights relating to the Galputs Minerale Project. For the Galputs
deal to be fulfilled the condition precedent was that the South African Department of Minerals and
Energy had to give its written approval to transfer the shares from the vendor to the purchaser by no
later than May 31, 2008. No written approval was obtained, so this acquisition was not completed.
Makoenskloof property acquisition
In  conjunction  with  the  acquisition  of  Durnpike,  HCVW  had  an  option  agreement  to  acquire  the
Makoenskloof  alluvial  diamond  project  in  South  Africa.  As  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  HCVW  by
Durnpike,  and  concurrent  acquisition  of  Durnpike  by  Rockwell,  the  Company  assumed  the  option  to
purchase  the  Makoenskloof  property.  In  November  2006,  HCVW  exercised  its  option  to  purchase  the
property and the company that held the mineral rights of the Makoenskloof property. The Company paid a
total consideration of ZAR 19 million ($2.7 million) for the property and associated equipment.
A  bulk  sampling  program  was  carried  out  during  fiscal  2008.  The  property  has  been  on  care  and
maintenance since that time.
Middle Orange River Operations (“MORO”) Agreement
– Page 17 –
In  March  2007,  Rockwell  and  Trans  Hex  and  its  subsidiary  THO  announced  that  the  companies  had
entered into an agreement whereby Rockwell’s wholly owned South African subsidiary, Rockwell RSA,
would acquire the MORO from Trans Hex (“the Transaction”). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction,
Trans Hex was to transfer all its relevant mineral rights and associated assets into a new special purpose
vehicle Saxendrift Mine Pty (Ltd) which Rockwell acquired via Rockwell RSA.
The MORO include:
the rights to prospect and explore for and/or mine precious stones and/or other minerals and/or
metals held directly or indirectly by THO in the Saxendrift area (described above);
substantial indicated and inferred mineral resources;
the material plant, machinery, equipment and other movable assets owned and/or used by THO -
These operating assets were independently valued by Manhattan Mining Equipment (Pty) Limited
in April 2005 at ZAR 53.3 million ($8.0 million);
the employees of THO in terms of Section 197 of South Africa’s Labour Relations Act of 1995; and
a rehabilitation liability which will be taken over by Rockwell on the basis that the tailings and other
heaps of unprocessed diamond bearing middlings gravel and Rooikoppie gravels will be
reprocessed by Rockwell to recover contained diamonds. The plan is to process the material and
simultaneously rehabilitate these areas.
The Transaction was substantially completed in April 2008 when the Ministerial consent to transfer the
Saxendrift mining right, as well as prospecting rights in respect of the Kwartelspan, Zwemkuil-Mooidraai
and part of the Remhoogte-Holsloot projects, was obtained. Cession of the Niewejaarskraal mining right
occurred  on  March  4,  2009,  and  a  payment  of  ZAR  18,901,294  ($2.4  million)  plus  interest  of  ZAR
2,381,294 ($0.3 million). Rockwell chose not to exercise the option on the Remhoogte prospecting right
due to current harsh financial constraints and depressed diamond prices. All the other rights have been
ceded to Saxendrift Mine (Pty) Ltd and Rockwell Resources RSA has taken ownership of the company.
Farhom Property
On  July  30,  2007,  H.C.  Van  Wyk  Diamonds  acquired  100%  of  the  shares  and  shareholder  loans  of
Farhom Mining & Construction (Pty) Ltd for ZAR10 million ($1.5 million). This company holds the mineral
rights over the Farhom farm which is part of the Wouterspan property. This transaction was concluded in
terms of an option granted to HCVW on February 24, 2005 and later amended on July 10, 2007.
Black Economic Empowerment Holdings (“BEE”) in Holpan, Klipdam and Wouterspan Properties
During  the  year  ended  May  31,  2007,  African  Vanguard  Resources  (Proprietary)  Limited  (“AVR”),  the
holding company of Richtrau No 136 (Proprietary) Limited (“Richtrau”) purchased through Richtrau a 15%
interest in the VWDG from the Van Wyk Trust for an amount of ZAR22.5 million ($3.4 million). During
November 30, 2008 AVR indicated its commitment to increase its shareholding in the VWDG to 26% by
subscribing for an additional 11% shares in each of the entities comprising the VWDG. The additional
11% stake was acquired by another subsidiary of AVR at a subscription price of ZAR 17.5 million.
– Page 18 –
The AVR group was also contractually committed to inject ZAR 10.5 million in working capital into the
VWDG.  Given  the  credit  crunch,  depressed  economic  conditions  and  fall  in  diamond  prices  the  AVR
group indicated to the Board of Directors of Rockwell RSA (the holding company of the entities in VWDG)
during the fourth quarter that it was unable to make these payments and that it would pursue funding
mechanisms to complete its obligations. Rockwell RSA has endeavoured to identify alternate sources of
funding  with  a  view  to  assist  AVR  to  complete  its  investment  but  these  attempts  were,  unsuccessful.
Rockwell RSA has entered into discussions with AVR and the Department of Minerals and Energy with
the assistance of its legal counsel to address completion of the BEE participation in the share capital of
the entities comprising the VWDG.

Alluvial deposit
Mineral Resource
National  Instrument  43-101,  the  national  securities  law instrument  in  Canada
respecting standards of disclosure for mineral projects.
Accumulation of mineralization as a result of deposition in a river or stream.
A  concentration  or  occurrence  of  diamonds,  natural  solid inorganic  material,  or
natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal,
and industrial minerals in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of
such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral
Resource  are  known,  estimated  or  interpreted  from  specific  geological evidence
and knowledge.
The mineral deposit classifications in this annual report on Form 20F adheres to
the resource/reserve definitions and classification criteria developed in 2005 by the
Canadian  Institute  of Mining  as  required  under  NI  43-101.  Estimated  mineral
resources  fall  into two  broad  categories  dependent  on  whether  the  economic
viability  of 
them has  been  established  and  these  are  namely  “resources”
(economic 
viability not  established)  and  ore  “reserves”  (viable  economic
production  is feasible). Resources are sub-divided into categories depending on
the confidence level of the estimate based on the level of detail of sampling and
geological understanding of the deposit. The categories, from lowest confidence to
highest  confidence,  are  inferred  resource,  indicated resource  and  measured
resource. Reserves are similarly sub-divided by order of confidence into probable
(lowest) and proven (highest).

Mining in the Republic of South Africa
South  Africa  has  recently  undergone  major  constitutional  changes  to  effect  majority  rule,  and  also  to
effect mineral title. Accordingly, many laws may be considered relatively new, resulting in risks such as
possible misinterpretation of new laws, modification of mining or exploration rights, operating restrictions,
increased taxes, environmental regulation, mine safety and other risks arising out of a new sovereignty
over mining, any or all of which could have an adverse impact upon Rockwell. Rockwell's operations
may  also  be  affected  in  varying  degrees  by  political  and  economic  instability,  crime,  fluctuations  in
currency exchange rates and inflation.
– Page 22 –
Changes,  if  any,  in  mining  or  investment  policies  or  shifts  in  political  attitude  in  South  Africa  may
adversely affect Rockwell's operations or likelihood of future profitability. Operations may be affected in
varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on production,
price  controls,  export  controls,  currency  remittance,  income  taxes,  expropriation  of  property,  foreign
investment,  maintenance  of  claims,  environmental  legislation,  land  use,  land  claims  of  local  people,
water use and mine safety.
The  political  situation  in  South  Africa  introduces  a  certain  degree  of  risk  with  respect  to  Rockwell's
activities. The Government of South Africa exercises control over such matters as exploration and mining
licensing, permitting, exporting and taxation, which may adversely impact on Rockwell's ability to carry
out  exploration,  development  and  mining  activities.  Failure  to  comply  strictly  with  applicable  laws,
regulations  and  local  practices  relating  to  mineral  right  applications  and  tenure  could  result  in  loss,
reduction or expropriation of entitlements or in the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint
venture partners with existing or other interests.
Government Regulation
The exploration and mining activities of Rockwell are subject to various South African national, provincial
and  local  laws  governing  prospecting,  development,  production,  taxes,  labour  standards  and
occupational health, mine safety, toxic substance and other matters. Exploration activities and mining are
also subject to various national, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment. These laws mandate, among other things, the maintenance of certain air and water quality
standards, and land reclamation. These laws also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation,
storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Although Rockwell's activities are currently carried
out in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations, to the best of its knowledge and belief no
assurance  can  be  given  that  new  rules  and  regulations  will  not  be  enacted  or  that  existing  rules  and
regulations  will  not  be  applied  in  a  manner  which  could  limit  or  curtail  production  or  development.
Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of exploration, mining
and milling or more stringent implementation thereof could have a material adverse effect on Rockwell's
business, results of operation and financial condition.
The mining industry in South Africa, where the Company's projects are located, is subject to extensive
regulation. The regulatory environment is developing, lacks clarity in a number of areas and is subject to
interpretation,  review  and  amendment  as  the  mining  industry  is  further  developed  and  liberalized.  In
addition,  the  regulatory  process  entails  a  public  comment  process,  which  makes  the  outcome  of
legislation and regulatory controls uncertain and may cause delays in the regulatory process.
In October 2006, the Government of South Africa released the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty
Bill 2006 (the "Royalty Bill") and the Diamond Export Levy Bill 2006 (the "Export Levy Bill"). The Royalty
Bill  requires  that  companies  extracting  diamonds  pay  a  royalty  of  5%  from  the  sales  of  those  metals,
payable on gross revenue.
In  order  to  address  inequalities  to  Historically  Disadvantaged  Persons  ("HDP")  engendered  by  South
Africa's  former  apartheid  system,  the  South  African  government  has  initiated  certain  government
empowerment initiatives (See discussion in Risk Factors).

Basis for Unit of Production and Depletion of Mineral Resources by Rockwell
The Indicated and Inferred Resource categories used by Rockwell for its alluvial diamond deposits follow
the CIM (“Canadian Institute of Metallurgy”) definitions.
Inferred Resource:
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality
can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but
not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and
drill holes.
Indicated Resource:
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality,
densities,  shape  and  physical characteristics  can  be  estimated  with  a  level  of  confidence  sufficient  to
allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and
evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  deposit.  The estimate  is  based  on  detailed  and  reliable
exploration  and  testing  information gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade
continuity to be reasonably assumed.
Rockwell Resource Determination Methodology:
Rockwell Diamonds Inc utilises a matrix system to determine the category a resource should be placed. It
must  be  noted  that  Rockwell  Resource declarations  are  inclusive  of  mining  dilution  and  process
inefficiencies  with  a 2  mm  bottom  cut  off.  The  value  of  the  diamonds  in  the  Resource  declaration  is
determined  through  the  sale  of  the  recovered  diamonds  and  not  through  the estimation  of  value  by
diamantiares.  All  Resources  are  for  a  100  percent  of  the mineral  area  and  not  for  the  ownership
percentage of Rockwell Diamonds Inc in the underlying subsidiary.

In conclusion Rockwell Diamonds Inc has sufficient confidence in its approach to resource determination
that the company has mined since inception in 2006 on these resources and has demonstrated that the
grades and diamond quality diamond values remain fairly consistent.
Reserves:
It must be noted that Rockwell is dealing with a distinct deposit-style. Other alluvial explorers and miners
all exploit higher grade deposits in central and western Africa and do not have to publicly list the results
of their resource determinations. Rockwell has not completed such extensive bulk sampling over all the
mineral areas due to the high cost and lack of production capacity. This lack of sampling over the entire
mineral area provides less confidence that Rockwell would need to assess the sustainability in diamond
grade  and  values  in  order  for  a  reserve  to  be  declared.  Over  time Rockwell bulk samples the various
mineral areas and when sufficient bulk sampling has been carried out over the entire mineral area the
Company  could  be in a position where the requirements for a pre feasibility study can be met and the
Company would be in such a position as to declare probable reserves under the Canadian Standards.
Unit of Measurement:
Rockwell Diamonds Inc reports all resources and depletion of resources in cubic metres. This is due to
the variable nature of the specific gravity throughout the resource area. This creates too many variables
for the Company to be satisfied in the accuracy of the numbers reported. Rockwell on a bi weekly basis
surveys all excavations and stockpiles to determine the volume of ore that has been processed through
the  processing  plants.  All  survey  data  is  signed  off  by  the  Chief  Surveyor  a Qualified Person and the
Mineral Resource Manager a Qualified Person. This data and its accompanying diamond production is
then reconciled on a bi weekly and entered into the Company’s database. This database is then used for
the compilation of the annual depletion.
No guidelines have been established for mineral reserves in alluvial diamond deposits because diamond
distribution in the deposit is not uniformly distributed. In addition, the size and quality of the diamonds
(and hence the value) may vary.
Diamond resources are established by drilling on a regular pattern across an area to assess the volume
of gravel units and taking several bulk samples that are processed to assess the number of diamonds, ie
estimate the grade over the volume of gravel drilled. Detailed assessments of the distribution of the size
and quality of diamonds in the bulk samples are also done.
Rockwell uses a 2mm size cut off to establish grade for resource estimates.
Rockwell’s grades for resource estimates incorporate losses due to mining dilution and process
efficiencies.
Mineral resources are sate for 100% ownership. All mines are owned 74% by Rockwell as
indicated in the Form 20-F on Page 19 Section B Business Overview.
The achieved value of the diamonds sales from bulk sampling or mining is used to represent the
average diamond value for the resource at the time of the estimate.
Trial mining (and processing) commonly occurs after drilling to increase the comfort that the gravel unit is
adequately diamondiferous to support the cost of extraction and processing.
Once  mining  is  underway,  the  information  from  processing  each  year  is  used  to  inform  the  resource
estimate, and the grade (and value per carat received) is adjusted to reflect the actual results. Depletion
of  mineral  resources  is  calculated  using  the  carats  produced  as  the  numerator  and  estimated  carat
resource available as the denominator.

to the State are owed.
History
Holpan  and  Klipdam  have  been  the  focus  of  intermittent  mining  since  the  early  1900’s  and  have
consistently  been  known  for  yielding  large  diamonds.  There  are  regular  references  to  this  in  historic
records  such  as  the  work  of  George  Beet  (1931),  who  discusses  the  ‘Broderick’  diamond  –  a  perfect
Cape  white,  weighing  412.5  carats.  VWDG  produced  in  excess  of  90,000  carats  of  diamonds  from
Holpan and Klipdam since 1994.
In 1994, the Van Wyk family began operations on claims on the Holpan property and shortly thereafter
Sonora Gold Inc., started operating on an adjacent part of the Holpan property. In 1996, Sonora Gold Inc.
acquired Klipdam Mining. Subsequently, in 1999, the company changed its name to Sonora Diamond
Corporation. During this time, the Van Wyks also acted as earth-moving contractors to Sonora.
The Van Wyk operations (incorporated in the company HCVW in 2001) were initially small but, with the
discovery  of  larger  diamonds  and  the  purchase  of  larger  earth  moving  equipment,  they  were  able  to
sustain and enlarge their operations. The HCVW operation grew steadily on Holpan, while the Sonora
venture stuttered and eventually collapsed. Records show that, subsequent to 2000, HCVW had grown to
a  sizable  operation  on  Holpan  and  acquired  Sonora  Diamonds,  thereby  expanding  the  company’s
presence on Holpan and Klipdam.
From 1994 to 2005 at Holpan-Klipdam, extensive mining of Rooikoppie and primary gravels took place,
as well as drilling and bulk testing. A high efficiency 200 tonnes per hour (tph) Dense Media Separation
(DMS) plant with X-ray Flowsort recovery and grease table final recovery apparatus began operation in
August 2005 and has done most of the processing since that time. Forty-one units of Volvo and Komatsu
equipment currently moves 159,000 cubic meters (m3) of gravel and overburden on a monthly basis.
Due  to  the  significant  burial  depth  of  the  Primary  gravels  at  Holpan-Klipdam,  the  thickness  and
distribution of the alluvial gravel deposits have been investigated through systematic percussion drilling.
A total of 3,243 boreholes totaling 14,486 m were drilled on the Holpan-Klipdam property between 1994
and  2005.  Drill  holes  extended  to  bedrock  in  the  majority  of  cases.  Boreholes  were  spaced  at  50  m
intervals along traverses 100 m apart. Chip samples were collected at 1-m intervals and logged on site by
a geologist. Procedures were audited in conjunction with the original field logs under the supervision of
Rockwell's consultant in November 2005.
In March 2006 an independent estimate of the inferred mineral resources for Holpan and Klipdam was
completed,  based  on  operational  statistics,  drilling  and  other  sampling  completed  to  that  time  as
12,339,700 m3 grading 1.16 carats per 100 m3, with an average value of US$848/carat. Potential for an
additional 4,800,000 m2 of gravel, that is similar, visually, to the Rooikoppie gravels, surrounds the area
of the inferred resource and that this gravel feature, was also identified from the prevalent red chert clasts
(pebbles) in the regolith, abandoned artisanal workings, and vegetation features discernable from aerial
photography, should be evaluated to determine its diamond content. Exploration work in fiscal 2008 and
fiscal 2009 was assessing this area.
– Page 30 –
Mining  at  the  Holpan  and  Klipdam  properties  from  January  2006  to  March  2007  focused  on  the
Rooikoppie gravels, and a volume of 1,889,308 m3 was mined and processed during the period. The total
Holpan and Klipdam inferred mineral resources as of March 31, 2007 were estimated to be 10,450,000
m3 grading 0.95 carats per 100 m3.
During  the  period  of  April  1,  2007  and  February  29,  2008,  1,591,429  m3  were  mined  at  Holpan  and
Klipdam. At February 29, 2008 the total inferred mineral resources were estimated to be 8,858,000 m3
grading 0.84 carats per 100 m3.
During 2007/2008, 774 Reverse Circulation (RC) boreholes were drilled on Klipdam/Holpan for a total of
4,890.5 m. A total of 3,490 holes (16,754 m) were used in the resource estimate, the results of which are
reported under Estimates of Mineralization below. The boreholes were drilled on a 100 x 50 m grid over
an area of 150 ha. Since regional gravel grades are, typically, less than 0.5carat/100 m3  and average
diamond sizes are typically >1carat per stone, boreholes are not sampled for diamonds. Furthermore, no
other minerals or elements that can be assayed are known to show positive (or negative) relationships
with diamonds in alluvial deposits, so no analytical procedures are described. Grades are estimated from
actual results from mining and processing.
During  the  period  January  2008  –  February  2009,  some  876,972  m3  of  gravel  was  processed  from
Klipdam from which 8,066.34 carats were extracted and 691,729 m3 of gravel from Holpan from which
5,073.41  carats  were  extracted,  for  a  total  of  1,568,701  m3  and  13,139.75  carats,  with  average  grade
recoveries of 0.91 carat/100 m3 and 0.74 carat/100 m3, respectively.
Geology
A key factor in the origin of the extensive and rich alluvial diamond deposits found in South Africa and
Namibia  is  the  existence  of  over  1000  diamond  bearing  kimberlites  across  southern  Africa  on  the
Kaapvaal Craton. Kimberlite emplacement was followed by liberation and entrainment of diamonds and
deposition in terraces on the ancient Vaal and Orange Rivers between approximately 4.8 million years
ago (Ma) and 4 Ma.
The  Holpan-Klipdam  deposit  comprises  an  extensive  flat-lying  alluvial  sequence  located  on  the  right
bank of the modern Vaal River and 6 km inland from a bend in the river known as "the Horseshoe". The
sequence  extends  across  an  area  of  approximately  5  km  by  2.5  km.  Economic  concentrations  of
diamonds  within  the  sequence  are  found  both  in  the  deflational  "Rooikoppie"  deposit  and  in  well
developed, clearly-defined palaeo-channels that were preserved by a highly resistant calcrete cap. The
palaeo-channels extend over several km and are up to 500 m wide in places. At Holpan and Klipdam, the
bedrock consists of Archaean Ventersdorp lavas, and shale’s and diamictites of the 300 to 250 million
year old Dwyka Group of the Karoo Supergroup.
The Rooikoppie unit varies in thickness from a few cm up to about 2 m and has an estimated average
thickness in the order of 1 m. Solution cavities up to 3 m deep in the calcretised bedrock form sharp,
discontinuous depressions and are filled with the overlying Rooikoppie gravel. Since such cavities, when
considered  in  a  hydrodynamic  context,  have  very  high  diamond  trapping  potential  and  are  of  key
economic  importance.  Given  the  high  incidence  of  pronounced  solution  features  in  the  palaeo-land
surface underlying the Rooikoppie (as observed in current mine workings at Holpan-Klipdam), this area
is considered to be of high interest with regard to its exploration potential.
– Page 31 –
The primary gravels found in the palaeo-channels typically comprise the lower third of the sedimentary
sequence and rest directly on the bedrock. The thickness of the gravel bed varies from about 1 to 6 m and
average  approximately  3  m  thick.  The  primary  gravels  comprise  a  poorly  sorted  assemblage  of  large
boulders (up to 45 cm in diameter at the base of the unit), cobbles and pebbles set in a sandy matrix that
is considered to have been deposited by a large, middle-stage, meandering river system.
High-resolution digital aerial photographs of the Holpan-Klipdam properties clearly show the distribution
of  mine  workings  in  the  area,  including  the  adjacent  Leicester  kimberlite  pipe.  Tonal  darkening,  seen
immediately to the west of the Klipdam plant area, corresponds closely to a buried palaeo-channel as
defined by exploration drilling, and is interpreted to be its surface expression.

Mining and Processing
The  mining  of  the  gravels  at  Holpan-Klipdam  uses  mechanized,  shallow  opencast  earthmoving
techniques. Topsoil (generally minimal) is removed and stored separately for use in later rehabilitation
activities. The top layer of Rooikoppie gravel is then bulldozed onto stockpiles from which it is loaded into
articulated dump trucks either by excavator or front-end loader for transport to the plant. The remaining
Rooikoppie is then removed from the uneven calcrete substrate by means of an excavator. Calcretised
overburden on top of the Primary gravel is removed so that the gravels are exposed and can be mined by
bulldozers and excavators. The calcrete overburden is backfilled, side-cast or used in road-building. Care
is taken to ensure the sterile excavation of the Primary gravels such that no contamination by the footwall
lithologies  occurs.  Excavation  continues  to  the  base  of  the  gravels  where  higher  basal  grades  are
expected  to  occur.  Where  the  bedrock  is  soft,  approximately  20  cm  of  bedrock  is  excavated  with  the
gravels, so that any diamonds in the weathered rock will be recovered.
The Primary gravels are transported by truck to the diamond recovery plants. Surveying of the box cuts is
undertaken on a monthly basis by the mine surveyor in order to obtain precise volumes for the Primary
gravel, the suspended gravel, the calcrete and the Rooikoppie, against which diamond production could
be reconciled and grade determined.
A  double-18  ft  rotary  pan-plant  system  used  to  process  gravels  on  Klipdam  and  a  Dense  Media
Separation  (DMS)  plant  is  used  on  Holpan.  Processing  volumes  (Run-of-Mine)  on  the  two  plants  are
approximately 350 tonnes per hour and 380 tonnes per hour, respectively.
– Page 33 –
Production and sales from Holpan and Klipdam for fiscal 2009, as well as production so far in fiscal 2010,
are discussed under Results of Operations (Item 5.A).
Planned Program
Currently, mining is taking place concurrently on both Klipdam and Holpan.
Rockwell plans to continue operations at Holpan and Klipdam during the fiscal year. Some efficiency
improvements are planned for the Klipdam Mine as well as adding an additional dewatering unit at the
Holpan Mine. There are no capital costs associated with these upgrades as any fabrication work will take
place within Rockwell’s mine workshops within existing maintenance and repair budgets.
There is a large amount of existing drill data, much of which requires analysis and integration with mining
results  and  will  take  place  during  normal  operations.  No  new  drilling  or  bulk  sampling  is  planned  for
Holpan  and  Klipdam.  If,  market  should  improve  during  2009,  then  some  540  m  of  reconnaissance
drilling/pitting (~360 pits) would be considered for Erf 1 Windsorton, the prospecting right adjacent (to the
east)  to  Klipdam.  The  estimated  cost  of  ZAR50,000  (US$5,500),  would  be  derived  from  operations
budget.

History
The first diamond discovered in South Africa was about 75 km upstream of Wouterspan on the MOR, and
led to the rapid proliferation of small-scale artisanal mining activities.
Early mining concentrated on the surface deflation deposits, known as Rooikoppie gravels. Rooikoppie
gravels were mined extensively between Douglas and Prieska from 1926 to 1936 and again during 1943
to 1945.
The MOR had not seen much prospecting and mining activity since that time because large areas are
covered by a very hard layer of calcrete, 0.5 m – 3 m thick, which limits access to the underlying gravel
horizons;  and  the  gravels  contain  a  high  percentage  of  banded  ironstone  clasts,  which  makes  the
treatment  and  concentration  of  the  gravels  technically  difficult  when  using  the  traditional  pan  plant
processes. More recently, the mining problem of the MOR was solved by the use of blasting and heavy
earthmoving  equipment  to  rip  and  remove  the  hard  calcrete-silcrete  layer.  This  new  technology  has
resulted in the area being effectively explored and mined for the first time.
A number of companies have been active in the area. The MOR alluvial deposits have regularly yielded
exceptional large diamonds such as a 211 carat stone recovered from a terrace on a high level terrace
upstream from Wouterspan and was reportedly sold for ZAR 28 million; a 181 carat stone recovered from
Terrace B on Saxendrift; a 205 carat stone recovered by Trans Hex from Saxendrift and a 175 carat stone
from Trans Hex’s MOR mine.
In 2005, drilling indicated an exploration target at Wouterspan of gravel in the range of 30 million tonnes.
Bulk sampling returned grades in the order of 0.4 - 0.5 carats per 100 m3.
Between  March  2005  and  January  2006,  a  total  of  513,892  m3  of  Primary  gravel  and  24,013  m3  of
Rooikoppie  from  11  localities  at  Wouterspan  property  were  tested  during  trial  mining  operations  by
VWDG.  Bulk  sampling  locations  were  selected  according  to  the  most  well-developed  gravel
assemblages  both  laterally  and  vertically  as  identified  by  drilling  and  a  series  of  box-cuts  were
excavated. This work indicated that the property hosts an extensive alluvial deposit with a large average
stone size within the Rooikoppie and Primary gravel units. A volume of approximately 4,481,000 m3  of
Rooikoppie gravel and 43,259,000 m3 of primary gravel was indicated as exploration potential from this
work.
– Page 35 –
Additional drilling was done in 2006, 2007 and 2008. An independent resource estimate was done at
February  2009.  Results  of  the  estimate  are  shown  under Estimates  of  Mineralization below.  Since
Indicated  Resources  are  estimated,  inter  alia,  by  defining  an  envelope  of  250  m  around/ahead  of  the
current  mining  face,  given  suitable  geological  conditions  and  drill  spacing,  after  mining  of  the  above
gravel from a previously identified indicated resource block, a new envelope was modelled to contain an
estimated  313,000  m3  of  gravel  derived  from  forward  modelling,  which  would  be  added  to  the  final
depleted resource estimate. Further, a minor amount of gravel volume (some 300,000 m3) was added to
the inferred resource category by limited infill drilling completed in 2008.
Geology
Large  areas  of  the  terrace  are  covered  by  diamond  bearing  surface  deposits  known  as  Rooikoppie
gravels, often separated from the underlying primary gravel by a hard layer of calcrete The basal gravels,
termed "Primary Gravels", are well exposed in the workings and shale’s and tillites of the Dwyka Group,
together with lava are common substrates of the gravels. The bedrock displays gully and pothole features
creating high diamond trapping potential. At Wouterspan, the gravels occur 20 - 30 m above the Orange
River and appear to have been deposited in a braided river system. Suspended gravel deposits found
between the Rooikoppie and Primary gravels have also been shown to contain diamonds.
The majority of the alluvial diamonds found in gravel deposits along the Middle Orange River (“MOR”) are
found in two distinct gravel horizons: an upper deflation deposit called the Rooikoppie gravel and the
basal Primary gravels.
The Rooikoppie unit varies in thickness from a few cm up to about 2 m and has an average thickness of
about  1  m.  The  deposit  typically  rests  on  sand,  gravel  or  in  places  a  hard,  semi-continuous  layer  of
calcrete  and  silcrete.  Solution  cavities  up  to  2  m  deep  in  the  calcretised  material  form  sharp,
discontinuous depressions that are filled with the overlying Rooikoppie gravel.
The Primary gravel deposits comprise the lower half to one third of the sedimentary sequence and rest
directly on the bedrock. These Primary gravels comprise a poorly sorted assemblage of large boulders
(up  to  45  cm  in  diameter  at  the  base  of  the  unit),  cobbles  and  pebbles  set  in  a  sandy  matrix  that  is
considered to have been deposited by a large, high-energy braided system that would be readily capable
of transporting diamonds. The total sequence varies from about 8 m to 18 m in thickness.
The Wouterspan alluvial deposits represent typical remnant river terraces comprising gravel sequences
formed, in large part, through reworking of glacial outwash deposits and appear to have a common or
similar  origin  as  seasonal  flood  deposits.  The  secondary  or  younger  gravels  represent  re-working  of
earlier deposits by late stage erosion and re-deposition as sheetwash flood gravels in low level terraces
often associated with river damming situations and splays.
The surface deflation Rooikoppie deposits comprise a diamond-bearing lag deposit created by erosion,
winnowing and removal of light components, and enrichment of heavy components including diamonds.
The lower lying terraces along the MOR (middle orange river) are farmed extensively by means of centre-
pivot  irrigation  systems.  In  addition,  much  of  the  area  is  blanketed  by  younger  Kalahari  sands  which
support scattered vegetation. As a result, aerial photographs and satellite images are of limited use for
delineating  potential  gravel  target  areas.  Further,  the  mostly  shale  bedrock,  combined  with  extensive
post-depositional  calcretisation  of  the  gravels  makes  it  difficult  to  identify  bedrock  channels  on  the
terraces  using  geophysical  surveys.  Consequently,  neither  geophysics,  nor  satellite  images  are  used
extensively as primary exploration tools along the MOR.

All historic exploration has been by drilling and bulk-sampling, which are described in detail in the next
two sections. No additional exploration has taken place on Wouterspan during the period October 2007 –
February 2009.

Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Inferred Resources
The  following  discussion  includes  references  to  "inferred resources".  Rockwell  advises  investors  that
while  this  term  is  recognized and  required  by  Canadian  securities  regulations  (under  National
Instrument 43-101 Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects),  the  U.S. Securities  and  Exchange
Commission does not recognize it. Readers cannot assume that all or any part of mineral deposits in this
category  will  ever be converted into reserves. In addition, "Inferred resources" have a great amount of
uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Under
Canadian  rules,  estimates  of Inferred  Mineral  Resources  may  not  form  the  basis  of  feasibility  or
preliminary feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that part
or all of an inferred resource exists, or is economically or legally mineable.

Planned Program
At the end of November 2008, Wouterspan was put on Care & Maintenance. Mining and an upgrade of
the processing plant are deferred pending an increase in the diamond price.
Saxendrift
Location, Access and Infrastructure
The Saxendrift project is located along the south bank of the middle Orange River between Douglas and
Prieska in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, which area has been the site of intense alluvial
diamond activity since the 19t h century. Saxendrift Mine is situated approximately 66 km southwest of
Douglas,  which  lies  110  km  southwest  of  Kimberley,  the  administrative  capital  of  the  Northern  Cape
Province and the historic centre of the South African diamond mining industry. The Kwartelspan prospect
is located some 4 km east of the mine property.
The Saxendrift Mine area is accessed via tarred route R357 from Douglas to Prieska. A well-maintained
network of high-speed gravel roads and farm tracks provides ingress to all areas of the Saxendrift Mine
and prospecting area. Rockwell has built a bridge across the Orange River to allow access between the
operations on the south (Saxendrift) and north (Wouterspan) sides of the river. Water for the Saxendrift
Mine is pumped from the Orange River. Power is accessed from the national power grid. To deal with
power  outages,  maintenance  is  scheduled  during  power  outages  and  a  1  megawatt  generator  was
acquired to run the plant. A backup generator is retained at the administration centre in Barkley West. An
unpaved airstrip and helipad are located on the property. A large, national, airport is located at Kimberley.
Labour and services are available in Douglas and skilled labour and broader services are available in
Kimberley.
Property Description and Ownership
Together the Saxendrift properties comprise 5,142.52 hectares as show in Table 5 below. The mining
area of Saxendrift Mine constitutes 1,368.17 hectares.

The surface rights to the Saxendrift Mine properties are held by Rockwell. The prospecting properties are
owned by third parties with whom land use agreements are negotiated. The prospecting rights on the
Kwartelspan Project cover some 903.65 hectares. Both Kwartelspan and Kransfontein properties are co-
owned by CEJ van Niekerk with whom Trans Hex had a surface use agreement. Although the agreement
lapsed at the end of February 2008, continued payment of a surface use rental by Rockwell has kept the
agreement in place until a new agreement is negotiated.
.
History
The  Saxendrift  area  has  had  a  long  history  of  diamond  production  dating  back  to  the  mid  1920’s.  An
estimated 96,000 carats of diamonds were extracted from the area between 1928 and 1964. Trans Hex
commenced exploration and mining in the area in 2000 through a merger with GEM Diamond Mining
Limited, which held the mineral rights to Saxendrift at that time.
While  owned  and  operated  by  Trans  Hex,  Saxendrift  comprised  three  mining  areas:  Brakfontein  (not
included  in  the  disposal  to  Rockwell),  Saxendrift  Terrace  A  and  Saxendrift  Terrace  B.  From
commissioning to the end of 2005, the Saxendrift Mine produced a total of 76,803 carats. The largest gem
quality stone ever produced by Trans Hex – a 216 carat octahedron – was from the Saxendrift operation
in 2001. Saxendrift also held the Trans Hex record for the highest dollar per carat price with a 9.22 -carat
blue  stone  that  was  sold  in  2003  for  in  excess  of  US$45,000/carat.  Production  on  Saxendrift  was
achieved by open cast mining methods with processing and recovery being achieved by a combination of
rotary pan plants, Dense Media Separation and Flow-sort X-ray recovery.
– Page 39 –
The Saxendrift Project was held by THO from 2000 until the sale to Rockwell in 2007/2008. Although
limited mining production took place up until January 2007, the Saxendrift Mine had officially been put on
“care and maintenance” during 2006 as a result of a variety of economic aspects.
Geology
The  present  Orange  River  between  Douglas  and  Prieska,  generally  referred  to  as  the  Middle  Orange
River (“MOR”), displays a meandering channel morphology, best developed in areas underlain by the
Dwyka  Group.  Palaeochannel  depositional  packages  of  the  Orange  River  are  preserved  at  different
elevations  above  the  present  Orange  River  bed.  The  ages  of  the  terraces  young  with  decreasing
elevation and, conversely, the probability of preservation decreases with increasing age and elevation.
The Saxendrift deposit comprises an extensive flat lying alluvial sequence located on terraces developed
on the left bank of the present Orange River, approximately 20-70 m above the Orange River.
The bedrock is well exposed in the workings and shale and tillite of the Karoo age Dwyka Group, are
common.  The  fluvial-alluvial  gravels  comprise  a  sequence  of  (basal)  gravels  2-4  m  thick  overlain  by
generally less than 5m of variably calcreted sands and silts and covered by a thin layer of soil and scree.
The cobble-sized clasts within the gravels consist mostly of lava and quartzite with significant, if variable,
amounts of Banded Iron Formation (BIF), and minor amounts of limestone, tillite, and agate. The matrix is
sandy  to  gritty.  As  is  usual  with  these  types  of  deposits  the  degree  of  calcretisation  decreases
downwards, from hardpan or laminar calcrete at the surface to loosely cemented gravels at depth. The
gravels are, generally, not well sorted, and are typical of braid bars that migrate through sections of river
channels in response to variable water speed.
Estimates of Mineralization
Rockwell re-modelled the resources according to the Company standards, and identified differences in
volumes  based  on  an  incomplete  dataset  supplied  to  Rockwell  by  Trans  Hex,  and  different  to  that
supplied  to  Venmyn  in  2006/7.  Overall,  the  indicated  resources  have  increased  and  the  inferred
resources have decreased from the previous estimate.
The  mineral  resources  at  February  28,  2009  were  estimated  by  Rockwell’s  Manager,  Resources,  G.
Norton,  Pr.Sci.Nat.,  a  qualified  person  who  is  not  independent  of  the  Company  and  reviewed  by  T.
Marshall, PhD, Pr.Sci.Nat., a qualified person who is independent of the Company and is responsible for
the estimate.
Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Indicated Resources
The following discussion includes references to "indicated resources". Rockwell advises investors that
while  this  term  is recognized  and  required  by  Canadian  securities  regulations  (under  National
Instrument  43-101 Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects) , the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission does not recognize it. Readers cannot assume that all or any part of mineral deposits in this
category will ever be converted into reserves

Planned Program
During Trans Hex’s tenure, a number of tailings-, oversize-, and rock- dumps were created. Based on
visual inspection, it is thought likely that many of these might prove viable gravel resources – either they
were too wet to process initially, or they are full of calcreted lumps of gravel due to the mining method
practiced  at  the  time,  or  the  BIF  content  is  extremely  high,  or  for  various  combinations  of  the  above.
Rockwell has identified each of these dumps and will sample them systematically over the 2009/2010
period to determine whether or not they should be included in the Saxendrift resource. These samples
will  be  batch  processed  through  the  old  pan-plant.  Following  commissioning  of  the  new  plant  in  late
2008, virgin gravels from Terrace A were mined and processed on a trial-production basis Rockwell will
focus on reviewing and integrating drill data received from Trans Hex on the Saxendrift and Kwartelspan
properties prior to planning any additional drilling programs. Supplementary geological mapping also is
planned for Kwartelspan under current operational budget.
Rockwell proposes to upgrade the screening and final recovery sections of the plant at Saxendrift in fiscal
2010,  using  one  of  three  fully-functional  rotary  screens  on  the  Wouterspan  property.  There  are  only
relocation and installation costs of some ZAR 100,000 (approximately US$12,500).
With  respect  to  the  planned  upgrade  of  the  final  recovery  plant  which  will  be  improved  to  process
Saxendrift  concentrate  as  well  as  that  from  Niewejaarskraal  and  Wouterspan  when  these  properties
come  on-stream.  Rockwell  plans  utilise  existing,  spare  X-Ray  FLOWSORT  machines  to  expand  the
throughput capacity of the existing facility.
Niewejaarskraal
Location and Access
The Niewejaarskraal project (comprised on the Niewejaarskraal and Viegelandsput properties) is located
along the south bank of the Orange River between Douglas and Prieska in the Northern Cape Province
of South Africa Douglas lies 110 km southwest of Kimberley. Niewejaarskraal is situated approximately
66 km southwest of Douglas, some 13 km beyond Saxendrift Mine (to the south).
– Page 42 –
The Niewejaarskraal Project area is accessed via tarred route R357 from Douglas to Prieska. A well-
maintained  network  of  high-speed  gravel  roads  and  farm  tracks  provides  ingress  to  all  areas  of  the
property.  Water  can  be  pumped  from  the  Orange  River.  The  property  is  connected  to  the  national
electricity grid, and the Company retains a backup generator in the Barkly West area to supplement as
necessary. An unpaved airstrip and helipad is situated on the Saxendrift property, some 24 km by road
from the project site. A large, national, airport is located at Kimberley.
Property Description and Ownership
The  Niewejaarskraal  project  is  comprised  of  the  farms  Niewejaarskraal  40  (two  separate  surveyed
portions  of  Ptn  6  and  a  portion  of  Ptn  4,  and  Portion  of  Portion  2)  and  re/farm)  and  Portion  of  the
Remainder Viegelandsput 39 in the Prieska district of the Northern Cape Province. The area covered by
the Mining Right is 1,766.39 ha. The Surface Rights are held by Die Nuwejaarskraal Testamentere Trust
(MT1601/2000) and Redivuvus Louw, with whom Rockwell has land-use agreements in place.

History
The first alluvial diamond discovery in South Africa was on the farm De Kalk on the banks of the Upper
Orange River, some 55 km upstream from Saxendrift in 1866. Recoveries of several large diamonds over
100 carat in size led to initial enthusiastic mining of shallow Rooikoppie gravels by artisanal diggers, who
flocked  to  the  area  mining  diamonds  from  the  high  level  terraces.  Since  the  late  1800’s,  numerous
properties along the middle Orange River have been prospected/mined for alluvial diamonds the majority
of which have been derived from the Rooikoppie gravels.
– Page 43 –
The Niewejaarskraal Project was held by THO from 2001 until the sale to Rockwell in 2007/2008.
Trans Hex began development of the Niewejaarskraal Mine with a bulk-sampling program in mid-2001. A
DMS plant was erected on site and full-scale production commenced in April 2002. This operation was
suspended in late 2006.
Trans Hex commissioned Venmyn to complete mineral resource estimates in conjunction with its plans to
sell  the  MORO  properties.  The  March  2007  estimate  showed  indicated  resources  of  5,967,500  m3
grading 0.91 carats per 100 m3 and inferred resources of 8,080,000 m3 grading 0.73 carats per 100 m3.
Rockwell  acquired  the  property  in  April  2008,  subject  to  cessation  rights  from  the  DME  which  were
acquired in February 2009.

The  present  Orange  River  between  Douglas  and  Prieska,  generally  referred  to  as  the  Middle  Orange

The  lower  lying  terraces  along  the  MOR  are  farmed  extensively  by  means  of  centre-pivot  irrigation
systems. In addition, much of the area is blanketed by younger Kalahari sands which support scattered
vegetation. As a result, aerial photographs and satellite images are of limited use for delineating potential
gravel  target  areas.  Further,  the  mostly  shale  bedrock,  combined  with  extensive  post-depositional
calcretisation  of  the  gravels  makes  it  difficult  to  identify  bedrock  channels  on  the  terraces  using
geophysical  surveys.  Consequently,  neither  geophysics,  nor  satellite  images  are  used  extensively  as
primary exploration tools along the MOR.

Planned Program
The  current  plan,  given  the  depressed  state  of  the  international  diamond  market  and  weak  diamond
prices is for the Niewejaarskraal mine to remain on care and maintenance for the period 2009 to 2010
due  to  market  circumstances.  However,  this  operation  has  in  the  past  produced  high  value  and
exceptional stones and on this basis the Company plans to modernize and re-open the mine once the
diamond market improves.

ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS
– Page 45 –
The following discussion and analysis of Rockwell's financial condition and results of operations for the
fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, the nine months ended February 29, 2008 and the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2007 should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and
related  notes  included  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  20-F.  The  consolidated  financial  statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 20-F were prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. For a
reconciliation of the Canadian GAAP to US GAAP, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
Overview
Rockwell  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  alluvial  diamond  production.  The  Company  is  focused  on
acquiring  additional  operating  diamond  properties  or  projects  that  have  near-term  potential  for  alluvial
diamond production, as described in detail under ITEM 4B of the Annual Report on Form 20-F
Going Concern
Rockwell  Diamonds  Inc.  (“Rockwell”  or  the  “Company”)  is  incorporated  under  the  British  Columbia
Business  Corporations  Act (formerly  the Company  Act of  British  Columbia),  and  is  engaged  in  the
business of diamond production and the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. The
Company’s principal mineral property interests are located in South Africa.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (''GAAP''). The going concern basis
of presentation assumes that Rockwell will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be
able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
The Company incurred losses of $13 million during the year ended February 28, 2009 and continues to
incur losses subsequent to year end. Although the Company has reduced costs substantially, sales of
diamonds have also decreased. The risk that cash and working capital will not be sufficient to fund the
continuing losses indicates that a material uncertainty exists which may cast substantial doubt on the
ability  of  the  Company  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  The  directors  believe  that  the  Company  will
continue as a going concern for the fiscal year 2010 due to the following:
At year end, the Company’s current assets exceeded its current liabilities by $0.6 million and the
Company’s total assets exceeded its total liabilities by $70.4 million.
The cash flow forecasts for the fiscal year 2010 indicate that additional funds of US$4 million will be
required to enable the Company to continue as a going concern. The additional funding was
calculated on the assumption that volumes remain constant with current production, with the new
plant still operating at below 50% capacity, prices remaining at current depressed levels, which are
55% below pre crisis levels and the South African Rand remains at current levels relative to the
United States and Canadian dollar.
The directors have commenced plans to raise financing, and the following plans have been considered to
raise these funds:
Private placement
Prospectus
Rights offering
The directors have started the process towards exercising either a rights offering or a private placement,
and have identified and communicated with current investors and potential new investors to ensure that
the desired investment is raised.
– Page 46 –
Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies applicable
to a going concern. Should the Company and its subsidiaries be unsuccessful in raising the additional
funds of US$4 million, they may be unable to realise their assets and discharge their liabilities in the
normal course of business. If the going concern basis is not appropriate for these consolidated financial
statements,  then  significant  adjustments  would  be  necessary  in  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and
liabilities, the reported revenues and expenses, and the balance sheet classifications used.
Critical Accounting Policies
The  Company's  significant  accounting  policies  are  presented  in  note  3  of  the  accompanying  audited
consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  February  28,  2009.  A  reconciliation  of  material
measurement differences between these principles and accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States is shown in note 17. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
Canadian and US generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis and bases them on various assumptions that
are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  The  Company's  estimates  form  the  basis  for
making judgments about the carrying value of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Such estimates and assumptions include the estimation of mineral resources and reserves, the carrying
values of mineral properties, the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, the assumptions used
in determining the reclamation obligation, and the valuation of stock-based compensation expense.
A. Results of Operations
Rockwell's annual and quarterly operating results are primarily affected by the level of operations activity
associated with its mineral property interests. Economic factors such as foreign exchange fluctuations,
mineral  prices  and  regulatory  development  may  also  affect  the  Company's  operating  results  and  the
volatility  of  the  trading  price  of  its  common  stock.  To  management's  knowledge,  there  are  no
governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have materially affected, or
could  materially  affect,  directly  or  indirectly,  the  Company's  operations  that  are  not  disclosed  in  this
Annual Report. Inflationary factors have not had a material impact on the Company's operating results for
fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. The Company's financial position and results of operations are summarized

The average cash costs of production from March 1 to July 31, 2009 (over the Company’s 2010 fiscal
year) for the group has been approximately US$2.64 per tonne. A combination of restructuring, efficiency
and plant throughput improvements, cost control measures, and increasing production are successfully
keeping monthly cash costs below the Company’s target range of US$3.00 –3.50 per tonne. This unit
cost is expected to remain at the low end of the range as the Company continues to increase production
at existing operations and improve processing plant efficiencies.
Fiscal 2009 compared to nine months ended Fiscal 2008
– Page 49 –
In December 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a resolution to change the Company’s
year end from May to February, resulting in a nine month period for the fiscal period ended February 29,
2008. The information presented below is a comparison of the twelve months year ended February 28,
2009 (“fiscal 2009”) and the nine months fiscal period ended February 29, 2008 (“fiscal 2008”).
The Company had a loss of $13 million for fiscal 2009 compared to a net loss of $9.4 million for the nine
months  ended  February  29,  2008.  The  loss  was  due  to  collapse  in  the  diamond  market  in  the  fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009, along with a global credit crunch which caused a total collapse in the demand and
prices of commodities, with the diamond market being badly hit. Consequently, the Company decided to
shut  down  operations  in  December  and  January,  and  the  Wouterspan  Mine  was  put  into  care  and
maintenance in order to preserve its cash balances.
During fiscal 2009, the Company realized diamond sales of $34.6 million compared to $36.1 million for
fiscal  2008.  This  decrease  was  a  result  of  the  economic  crisis  which  has  caused  diamond  prices  to
collapse, resulting in no sales between November 2008 and February 2009. Since February 2009, prices
remain approximately 55% below those achieved prior to November 2008.
Mining costs were $25.1 million in fiscal 2009 compared with $22.7 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009,
the Saxendrift mine was commissioned in February. Amortization and depletion for the year was $11.3
million compared to $6.5 million in the prior fiscal period. All commissioning and retention costs were
expensed and not capitalised. Due to the economic crisis, the Company decided to restructure the Middle
Orange River operations and place the Wouterspan mine on care and maintenance to conserve cash and
minimize costs. As part of this restructuring drive some 143 employees were retrenched, and short term
contracts for some 40 employees were not renewed. All operations were shut down over December 2008
and January 2009, with all staff paid in full during the shutdown period.
Expenses for fiscal 2009 increased to $9.7 million in comparison to $7 million incurred for fiscal 2008
($9.3  million  annualized).  Management  have  been  successful  in  containing  costs,  even  though  the
Company experienced significant legal costs due to the unsolicited bid by Pala and also had to make
restructuring and retrenchment payments during the last quarter of fiscal 2009.
Significant  impairments  were  made  as  a  result  of  the  economic  downturn.  Impairments  totalling  $2.6
million were incurred for mineral rights, property plant and equipment and receivables. As the diamond
market is recovering with prices anticipated to be back to 50% of pre crash prices and the appetite for
larger  stones  returning,  these  investments  are  anticipated  to  regain  their  market  value  in  the  next
eighteen months.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007
The Company had a loss of $9,403,027 for the nine month period ended February 29, 2008 compared to
a  net  loss  of  $6,365,142  for  the  year  ended  May  31,  2007.  The  biggest  component  of  this  loss  is
attributable to the non-controlling interest of $5,955,779 for this year compared to the $415,159 for the
year ended May 31, 2007. Of this $5,955,779 an amount of $4,463,261 related to an exchange gain as a
result of the 49% non-controlling interest being held at the South African operating subsidiaries rather
than at the consolidated entity level whereby they would have shared in a net foreign exchange gain of
only $751,358 thereby reducing the loss by $4,095,096 to $5,307,931. The further increase in net losses
during the period resulted from stock based compensation expenses recognized on stock options granted
during the nine months ended February 29, 2008, lower foreign exchange gains, interest expense on the
Company’s capital leases, increased accretion of reclamation obligations, loss on disposal of assets and
future  income  tax  expenses  which  was  offset  by  lower  exploration  and  convertible  note  accretion
expenses incurred in the year ended May 31, 2007. The Company recorded a loss of $0.05 per share for
the nine months ended February 29, 2008, compared to a loss of $0.11 per share for the year ended May
31, 2007.
– Page 50 –
During  the  nine  months  ended  February  29,  2008  the  Company  realized  rough  diamond  sales  of
$36,038,106  of  which  $9,802,308  was  earned  during  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  2008  compared  to
$12,125,363 for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and to $nil for the comparable period in the prior year.
Mine site operating costs for the nine months ended February 29, 2008 amounted to $29,264,212 (three
months ended February 29, 2008 - $9,768,420, three months ended November 30, 2007 - $11,712,135),
which includes amortization and depletion charges of $6,533,941 (six months ended November 30, 2006
– nil).
Exploration expenses (excluding stock-based compensation) decreased to $604,169 for the nine months
ended February 29, 2008 compared to $1,371,351 for the year ending May 31, 2007. This decrease is
due to higher exploration activities incurred during the year ended May 31, 2007 performed on the African
diamond properties which included the Holpan/Klipdam property. The exploration expenses for the nine
months ended February 29, 2008 were mainly incurred on the Kwango River Project in the DRC and the
Ricardo property in Chile.
The Company incurred a foreign exchange gain of $751,318 for the nine months ended February 29,
2008  compared  to  a  foreign  exchange  gain  of  $3,580,364  for  the  year  ended  May  31,  2007  due  to  a
higher  amount  of  South  African  denominated  liabilities  and  the  strengthening  of  the  Canadian  dollar.
Foreign exchange gains to the amount of $11,900,802 were realized in Durnpike and in Minera Ricardo
(of which the non-controlling interest’s share of this gain was $4,463,261), while foreign exchange losses
of $11,149,484 were accounted for in Rockwell RSA, Cayman Islands and Rockwell Canada (the non-
controlling interest did not share in these losses) for the period ended February 29, 2008. Because the
non-controlling interest did not share in the loss, this increased the loss for the consolidated Company.
Office and administrative costs for the nine months ended February 29, 2008 amounted to $2,697,077 in
comparison to $2,993,453 incurred in for the year ended May 31, 2007, the variance is primarily due to
reduced consulting and salary expenses as the Company has completed its major corporate financing,
acquisition,  and  operational  management  and  property  investigation  activities.  Travel  and  conference
expenses amounted to $654,705 for the nine months ended February 29, 2008 compared to $666,194 for
the  year  ended  May  31,  2007,  largely  due  to  reduced  travel  as  the  acquisition  activities  have  been
completed.  Legal,  accounting  and  audit  expenses  for  the  nine  months  ended  February  29,  2008
amounted to $790,725 compared to $691,759 incurred for the year ended May 31, 2007. This increase
was  primarily  due  to  increased  legal  and  accounting  services  related  the  listing  on  both  the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the TSX, these increases were however partially offset by reduced
legal and accounting services as the Company’s acquisition activities of Durnpike and HC Van Wyk have
been completed.
– Page 51 –
Stock-based  compensation  increased  to  $1,826,317  for  the  nine  months  ended  February  29,  2008  in
comparison to $79,623 for the year ended May 31, 2007 due to an increase in the number of options
granted during fiscal 2008.
B. Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
At  February  28,  2009,  the  Company  had  cash  of  $4.0  million,  restricted  cash  of  $2.7  million  and  an
overdraft balance of $3.5 million, a net balance of $3.1million, with available cash of $0.4 million and a
working capital of $0.6 million, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $19.6 million and working
capital of $26.1 million at February 29, 2008.
The  Company  had  no  long-term  debt  at  February  28,  2009,  other  than  asset  retirement  obligations
relating  to  its  Klipdam,  Holpan,  Wouterspan  mines  and  Saxendrift  operations,  and  capital  lease
obligations relating to mining equipment with three to four year lease agreements. The Company’s capital
lease obligations are denominated in South African Rand (“ZAR”). Capital lease obligations have been
presented at an exchange rate of 1 Canadian dollar = ZAR 7.8, the closing rate in effect on February 28,
2009. Since then, the South African Rand has further strengthened to 1 Canadian dollar = ZAR 7.3 by
mid May 2009.
The  significant  decline  in  the  prices  of  diamonds  in  recent  months  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the
Company’s  profitability.  With  the  current  global  financial  crisis  and  economic  downturn,  the  Company
anticipates diamond prices will remain depressed in the near term.
In light of the current economic environment, the Company’s near-term goal has been to preserve its cash
balance to the greatest extent possible, by minimizing operating costs and curtailing capital expenditures.
In  this  regard,  the  Company  is  reviewing  its  operations  with  a  view  to  optimize  efficiencies,  putting
marginal  operations  on  care-and-maintenance,  and  reducing  costs  wherever  possible  without
compromising safety, health or environmental standards. Specific initiatives taken include:
Restructuring and retrenchments were undertaken to reduce costs;
The high cost, low grade Wouterspan operation was placed on care and maintenance in January
2009;
Introduction of a smart mining program to modernize earth moving procedures, and the initiation of a
comprehensive review of processing and recovery plant to ensure optimization and lowering of
operating costs;
The operations team and mine managers, assisted by a professional engineer, have implemented
significant technical and operational improvements at the Holpan DMS to reduce costs, and
improve throughput;
The progressive implementation of wide ranging optimization and de-bottlenecking of the new high
volume Saxendrift processing and final recovery plant by a dedicated engineering task force to
ensure improved throughput and lowering of costs; and
Improving utilization of the earth moving fleet which, in addition to reducing costs, has given the
Company the ability to develop new operations without outlays of large amounts of capital on new
earth moving equipment.
– Page 52 –
The Company also continues to review its capital expenditure program for 2009, non-core activities
and all service provider contracts. Management continues to focus on improved operational
practices and efficiencies at each mining operation, and is actively identifying additional cost cutting
opportunities.
The Company anticipates the cost reduction and operational efficiency measures taken by the Company
along with existing cash flow from operations and the Company’s holdings of cash and cash equivalents
will be sufficient to fund current operations and satisfy obligations as they come due.
Although the Company has implemented the necessary plans to ensure sufficient financial liquidity in the
near term, the Company’s ability to repay or refinance its financial liabilities to their contractual maturities
depends on a number of factors such as an improvement in diamond demand and prices and unfreezing
of credit and capital markets, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. There is no assurance
that our expected cash flows from operations in combination with other steps being taken will allow the
Company to meet these obligations as they become due.
The  Company  has  an  overdraft  facility  in  the  amount  of  ZAR28  million  ($3.8million)  available  for  its
operations. Current operating income is being used to service this facility. This facility has an interest cost
based on prime and is reviewed periodically.
As of the end of June 10, 2009, the Company has unrestricted cash of $1.4 million and has utilized $2.8
million of the $3.5 million overdraft facility to maintain its operational requirements. The cash available of
$2.1 million is available to finance the shortfall in operations until the anticipated breakeven point in the
market prices anticipated in September 2009.
The average expenditures in the first few months of the current 2010 fiscal year is approximately ZAR5
million  per  month  and  has  been  decreasing  as  sales  have  been  increasing.  This  recovery  has  been
slowed by the strengthening of the ZAR in relation to sales achieved in US$.
To  ensure  the  continuation  of  operations,  and  develop  existing  and  new  opportunities,  the  Board  of
Directors of Rockwell have proposed a financing to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet through a
rights offering.
Capital Resources
The Company's sources of capital are primarily equity investment and debt.
Historically, the Company’s sources of funding have been cash flow from operations and the issuance of
equity securities for cash, primarily through private placements to sophisticated investors and institutions.
The  Company  has  issued  common  share  capital  in  each  of  the  past  few  years,  pursuant  to  private
placement  financings  and  the  exercise  of  warrants  and  options.  The  Company’s  access  to  financing,
when  the  financing  is  not  transaction  specific,  is  always  uncertain.  There  can  be  no  assurance  of
continued access to significant equity funding.
The  Company's  access  to  capital  sources  is  dependent  upon  general  financial  market  conditions,
especially those that pertain to venture capital situations such as mineral exploration and development.
Recent market events and conditions, including disruptions in the international credit markets and other
financial  systems  and  the  deterioration  of  global  economic  conditions  have  had  a  significant  material
adverse impact on a number of financial institutions forcing them into bankruptcy or requiring government
authorities to rescue them. These events and a general flight from risk have limited access to capital and
credit for many companies. The unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets,
could, among other things, impede access to capital or increase the cost of capital, which would have an
adverse effect on the Company’s ability to obtain, or increase its cost of obtaining, capital and financing, if
required, for its operations. The Company’s access to additional capital may not be available on terms
acceptable to the Company or at all.
– Page 53 –
Furthermore, in recent months, worldwide securities markets have experienced a high level of price and
volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced unprecedented
declines in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance, underlying asset
values or prospects of such companies. In addition, significantly higher redemptions by holders of mutual
and hedge funds has forced many of such funds (including those holding the Company’s securities) to
sell such securities at any price. Therefore, there can be no assurance that significant fluctuations in the
trading price of the Company’s common shares will not occur, or that such fluctuations will not materially
adversely affect the Company’s ability to raise equity funding without significant dilution to its existing
shareholders, or at all.
During  the  year  ended  February  28,  2009,  the  Company  did  not  complete  any  debt  financings.  The
Company anticipates that it has sufficient funding facilities and funds available (Ref 1.6 above) to meet its
working  capital  requirements,  provided  that  the  diamond  market  recovers  and  sales  achieve  over
US$917 per carat on the near future and the exchange rate remains constant. At an exchange rate of
ZAR8.8  /  US$1  and  current  volumes  and  grade  being  achieved,  breakeven  point  is  anticipated  to  be
reached when the Sales price per carat recovers to the US$1000 – US$1,100 per carat range.
The Company intends to raise additional funds and are investigating various available options at this
stage  to  ensure  adequate  working  capital  should  the  recovery  in  the  markets  be  delayed  beyond  our
estimations and to complete capital projects to expand production.
Other  than  already  described  above,  the  Company  had  no  other  lines  of  credit  or  other  sources  of
financing which have been arranged but as yet unused as at February 28, 2009.
Financial Instruments
The  Company's  financial  instruments  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash,  amounts
receivable, security deposit, reclamation deposit, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, reclamation
obligation, capital leases, amounts owing pursuant to acquisition and balances receivable from or due to
related parties. In addition, the Company has cash and certain liabilities denominated in South African
rand. As a result, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk from fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates.  The  Company  has  not  entered  into  any  derivative  or  other  financial  instruments  to  mitigate  this
foreign exchange risk.
The Company limits exposure to credit risk on liquid financial assets through maintaining its cash and
cash  equivalents  with  high-credit  quality  financial  institutions.  The  Company  does  not  have  financial
assets that are invested in asset backed commercial paper. The Company's minimize its credit risk by
settling the receivables on its diamond sales in the month following the sale.
The Company has capital lease obligations with several financial institutions. The capital leases bear
interest at rates linked to the prevailing prime rate of the relative financial institution, and are subject to
interest rate change risk.
– Page 54 –
The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values, unless otherwise noted.
Material Commitments for Capital Expenditures
At  February  28,  2009  and  August  21,  2009,  the  Company  had  no  material  commitments  for  capital
expenditures.
C. Research and Development, Patents and License, etc.

D. Trend Information
The months from November 2008 to February 2009 were the most testing times for prices and the overall
diamond industry since the Great Depression. In response, Rockwell cancelled all sales for November
and  December  2008,  embarked  on  a  cost  cutting  program  and  also  suspended  all  operations  for  the
months December 2008 and January 2009. The immediate decisions which Rockwell management took
during  this  period  assisted  the  Company  to  address  the  challenges  of  the  credit  crunch  and  related
depressed diamond prices.
The diamond industry’s financial stability was severely tested during this period and resulted in a few
operations being liquidated as the industry and banks worked together to avoid liquidations as this would
have  had  a  detrimental  ripple  effect  on  the  industry  overall.  However,  there  was  a  large  amount  of
stressed sales of inventory, which created opportunities for companies with a positive cash balance.
Retailers  continued  their  resistance  to  purchasing  additional  inventory  and  also  reduced  in-store
inventory to acceptable levels while improving their levels of debt. The result of these latter actions was a
worldwide cessation of trade in polished diamonds and, subsequently, rough diamonds for the months
November to January. Trade resumed in February albeit very cautiously. A lower level of stressed sales
continued through February and ultimately placed pressure on the values offered for rough diamonds,
creating further opportunities for cash strong traders, and enabling them to purchase rough diamonds at
prices  that  reduced  the  average  values  of  their  inventories.  The  pressure  placed  on  rough  diamond
values and the high amount of opportunistic buying resulted in producers receiving around 50% below
the high prices received in 2008.
Certain producers were forced to sell at these prices while Rockwell managed its operations and cash
flow, and deferred selling until the latter part of February. Therefore, Rockwell diamonds were not sold at
massive discounts. Rockwell also moved away from selling its entire inventory on tenders as we realized
that traders were not prepared to offer good value but were attempting to purchase at prices equivalent to
those last seen in the year 2000. Furthermore, the Company sold both directly to the industry and in part
via tender. The combination of the postponement of diamond sales as well as using direct sales earned
Rockwell better prices.
The largest producers, De Beers and Alrosa, also resisted selling at the discounted prices and introduced
a  slow  down  and  cessation  at  the  operational  level.  Most  producers  world-wide  adopted  a  similar
approach of cessation and reduction in production. Rough diamond inventory immediately reduced and,
remarkably, shortages became evident in late February resulting in the increase in rough diamond prices.
– Page 55 –
The  polished  market  was  equally  stressed  but  the  diamond  engagement  sector  of  the  retail  industry
maintained itself and saw relatively high volumes of polished 0.75 carat-2 carat stones sold, resulting in a
price and demand increase for rough diamonds up to 5 carats in size. There was little demand for larger,
over 5 carat rough diamonds because traders were unwilling to invest in a product that was difficult to sell
unless such diamonds were highly discounted.
By the end of February 2009, rough diamond prices were 40% below the highs of 2008 (84% below the
averages achieved by Rockwell in 2008 due to both price and mix). However based on the Company’s
own results and market research, and information gleaned from the world wide web. Polished Prices, the
BMO Rough Diamond Index, and Royal Bank Canada Diamond Research publications indications are
that rough diamond prices have begun to increase since that time as shown in tender prices in March and
May.  (The  average  price  per  carat  received  increased  from  US$318.32  in  February,  to  US$513.43  in
March and to US$584.69 in May).
Rockwell is relatively confident that rough diamond prices will continue to increase during 2009 as is
supported by market experts. However the occurrence of possible further corrections in rough diamond
prices through 2009 cannot be totally discounted.
The  graph  below  provides  a  summary  of  Rockwell’s  diamond  production  and  prices  since  start-up  in
2006  is  indicated  below.  This  graph  is  typical  of  alluvial  diamond  producers  in  that  it  shows  strong
fluctuations consistent with the highly varied nature of alluvial diamond mine production as compared to a
primary kimberlite production prices. Because of this, predicting average prices is challenging. In respect
of 2009 sales, data suggest that the overall market prices appear to be trending upwards in line with the
views of market observers and experts.
E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
– Page 56 –
Rockwell does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Several  Directors  of  Rockwell  also  serve  as  directors  of  other  similar  companies  involved  in  natural
resource development. Accordingly, it may occur that properties will be offered to both Rockwell and such
other companies. Furthermore, those other companies may participate in the same properties as those in
which Rockwell has an interest. As a result there may be situations which involve a potential conflict of
interest or issues in connection with the doctrine of “corporate opportunity”. In that event, a financially
interested  director  would  not  be  entitled  to  vote  at  meetings  of  directors  in  respect  of  a  transaction
involving the Company if it evokes any such conflict. The directors will attempt to avoid dealing with such
other companies in situations where conflicts or corporate opportunity issues might arise and will at all
times use their best efforts to act in the best interests of Rockwell.

Governance  Policies  and  Procedures  Manual  (the  “Manual”).  This  charter  as  well  as  the  Manual  are
available for viewing at the Company’s website at www.rockwelldiamonds.com.
The function of the Compensation Committee is to review, on an annual basis, the compensation paid to
the Company’s executive officers and directors, to review the performance of the Company’s executive
officers and to make recommendations on compensation to the Board.
The  Compensation  Committee  periodically  considers  the  grant  of  stock  options.  Options  have  been
granted  to  the  executive  officers  and  directors  and  certain  other  service  providers  taking  into  account
competitive compensation factors and the belief that options help align the interests of executive officers,
directors and service providers with the interests of shareholders.
The purposes and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation matters
are to assist the Board of Directors in carrying out its responsibilities relating to executive and director
compensation.  In  furtherance  of  this  purpose,  the  Compensation  Committee  has  the  following  duties,
responsibilities and authority:
(a) The Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors the form and amount of compensation to be
paid by the Company to directors for service on the Board and on Board committees. The Committee
shall review director compensation at least annually.
(b)  The  Committee  shall  annually  review  the  Company’s  base  compensation  structure  and  the
Company's incentive compensation, stock option  and  other  equity-based  compensation  programs  and
recommend changes in or additions in such structure and plans to the Board of Directors as needed.
(c)  The  Committee  shall  recommend  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the  annual  base  compensation  of  the
Company's executive officers and senior managers (collectively the "Officers").
(d) The Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors the range of increase or decrease in the
annual base compensation for non-Officer personnel providing services to the Company.
(e)  The  Committee  shall  recommend  to  the  Board  of  Directors  annual  corporate  goals  and  objectives
under any incentive compensation plan adopted by the Company for Officers and non-Officer personnel
providing  services  to  the  Company,  and  recommend  incentive  compensation  participation  levels  for
Officers  and  non-Officer  personnel  providing  services  to  the  Company  under  any  such  incentive
compensation  plan.  In  determining  the  incentive  component  of  compensation,  the  Committee  will
consider the Company’s performance and relative shareholder return, the values of similar incentives at
comparable companies and the awards given in past years.
– Page 64 –
(f) The Committee shall evaluate the performance of Officers generally and in light of annual corporate
goals and objectives under any incentive compensation plan.
(g)  The  Committee  shall  periodically  review  with  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  their
assessments  of  corporate  officers  and  senior  managers  and  succession  plans,  and  make
recommendations to the Board regarding appointment of officers and senior managers.
(h) The Committee shall provide oversight of the performance evaluation and incentive compensation of
non-Officer personnel providing services to the Company.
(i) The Committee shall administer the Company's stock option and other equity based compensation
plans and determines the annual grants of stock options and other equity based compensation.
(j) The Committee shall recommend to the Governance and Nominating Committee the qualifications and
criteria for membership on the Committee.
Report on Executive Compensation
The Board assumes responsibility for reviewing and monitoring the long-range compensation strategy for
the senior management of the Company although the Compensation Committee guides it in this role. As
part of its mandate, the Board determines the type and amount of compensation for the President and
Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers.
The  Company’s  Compensation  Committee  receives  independent  competitive  market  information  on
compensation  levels  for  executives,  if  necessary,  in  determining  the  level  of  compensation  for  the
executive officers and directors.
Mr. Copeland does not serve the Company solely on a full-time basis, and his compensation from the
Company is allocated based on the estimated amount of time spent providing services to the Company.
Mr. John Bristow, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Brenner work on the Company's activities on a full-time basis. The
Company’s  compensation  policies  and  programs  are  designed  to  be  competitive  with  similar  junior
mining exploration companies and to recognize and reward executive performance consistent with the
success of the Company’s business.
Philosophy and Objectives
The compensation program for the senior management of the Company is designed to ensure that the
level and form of compensation achieves certain objectives, including:
(a) attracting and retaining talented, qualified and effective executives; 
(b) motivating the short and long-term performance of these executives; and 
(c) better aligning their interests with those of the Company’s shareholders.
In  compensating  its  senior  management,  the  Company  has  employed  a  combination  of  base  salary,
bonus compensation and equity participation through its stock option plan.
Base Salary
– Page 65 –
In the Board’s view, paying base salaries which are competitive in the markets in which the Company
operates is a first step to attracting and retaining talented, qualified and effective executives. The NEOs
are paid a salary in order to ensure that the compensation package offered by the company is in line with
that offered by other companies in our industry, and as an immediate means of rewarding the NEO for
efforts expended on behalf of the company.
The salary to be paid to a particular NEO is determined by gathering competitive salary information on
comparable  companies  within  the  industry  from  a  variety  of  sources,  including  surveys  conducted  by
independent consultants and national and international publications. Payment of a cash salary fits within
the objective of the compensation program since it rewards the NEO for performance of his or her duties
and responsibilities.
The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is approved annually by the Board. Base salary and
bonus levels are determined taking into account independent market survey data.
Bonus Incentive Compensation
The  Company's  objective  is  to  achieve  certain  strategic  objectives  and  milestones.  The  Board  will
consider  executive  bonus  compensation  dependent  upon  the  Company  meeting  those  strategic
objectives  and  milestones  and  sufficient  cash  resources  being  available  for  the  granting  of  bonuses.
Bonuses are awarded at the discretion of the Board. The Board approves executive bonus compensation
dependent upon compensation levels based on recommendations of the Compensation Committee, and
such  recommendations  are  generally  based,  if  necessary,  on  survey  data  provided  by  independent
consultants. There were no bonuses awarded in the financial year.
Equity Participation
The Company has in place a share option plan dated for reference August 14, 2008 (the “Plan”). The
Plan has been established to provide incentive to qualified parties to increase their proprietary interest in
the  Company,  encourage  the  alignment  of  interests  with  its  shareholders  and  foster  their  continued
association with the Company.
The Company believes that encouraging its executives and employees to become Shareholders is the
best way of aligning their interests with those of its Shareholders. Equity participation is accomplished
through  the  Company’s  stock  option  plan.  Stock  options  are  granted  to  senior  executives  taking  into
account a number of factors, including the amount and term of options previously granted, base salary
and  bonuses  and  competitive  factors.  Options  are  generally  granted  to  senior  executives  and  vest  on
terms established by the Compensation Committee.
At  least  annually,  the  Compensation  Committee  reviews  the  grants  of  stock  options  to  directors,
management, employees and consultants. Options have been granted in prior years taking into account
competitive compensation factors and the belief that options help align the interests of such persons with
the interests of Shareholders.
Performance Graph
– Page 66 –
The  Company  commenced  trading  on  The  Toronto  Exchange  (“TSX”) on  February  22,  2008.  The
Company was previously listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”). The following graph compares
the cumulative shareholder return on the Company’s Common Shares for the last five fiscal years against
the return of the TSXV and the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index based on a $100 investment on
May 31, 2004. The year end of the Company was changed to February 28 in 2007.
Notes: The Company has not declared or paid a dividend on its Common Shares.
Option Based Awards
The Company’s long term incentives are designed to foster and promote the long-term financial success
of  the  Company  by  strengthening  the  ability  of  the  Corporation  to  attract  and  retain  highly  competent
employees,  motivate  performance  through  incentive  compensation,  promote  greater  alignment  of
interests  between  employees  and  shareholders  in  creating  long-term  shareholder  value,  and  enable
employees  to  participate  in  the  long-term  growth  and  financial  success  of  the  Company.  Long  term
incentives are comprised of stock options, with approximately the same value of each being provided.
The Black-Scholes method is used to value stock options. The share price on the date of grant is used to
value share units. Stock options provide employees with the opportunity to participate in the growth of the
Company’s  share  price  as  well  as  benefit  from  the  favourable  tax  treatment  applicable  to  this  form  of
compensation.
The  Compensation  Committee  approves  stock  options  to  facilitate  consideration  of  targeted  direct
compensation to senior executive officers. Options are generally granted in the last quarter of each year
as part of the annual compensation review. Options are granted at other times of the year to individuals
commencing employment with the Company. The exercise price for the options set in accordance with
the rules of the TSX and is based on the five-day volume weighted average closing price prior to the date
of grant.
– Page 67 –
Given the evolving nature of the Company’s business, the Board continues to review and redesign the
overall compensation plan for senior management so as to continue to address the objectives identified
above.
Stock Option Plan
The Company currently has a share purchase option compensation plan dated for reference August 14,
2008, the Stock Option Plan (for the purposes of this section, the “Plan”) approved by the shareholders in
September 15, 2008 that allows the Company to grant options up to 10% of the issued and outstanding
the  Shares  at  any  one  time,  typically  vesting  over  two  years,  to  its  directors,  employees,  officers,  and
consultants. The exercise price of each option can be set equal to or greater than the closing market price
of  the  Shares  on  the  TSX  on  the  day  prior  to  the  date  of  the  grant  of  the  option,  less  any  allowable
discounts.  Options  have  a  maximum  term  of  five  years  and  typically  terminate  30  days  following  the
termination of the optionee’s employment, except in the case of retirement or death.
Material Terms of the Plan
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Plan:
(a) Currently all options granted under the Plan are non-assignable and non-transferable and are
(b)
issueable for a period of up to five years;
 
for  stock  options  granted  to  employees  or  service providers  (inclusive  of  management
company  employees),  the  Company  must ensure that the proposed optionee is a bona fide
employee  or  service provider  (inclusive  of  management  company  employees),  as  the  case
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
may be, of the Company or any subsidiary;
 
if an optionee ceases to be employed by the Company (other than as a result of termination
with  cause)  or  ceases  to  act  as  a director  or  officer  of  the  Company  or  a  subsidiary  of  the
Company, any option held by such optionee may be exercised within 90 days after the date of
such optionee ceases to be employed as an officer or director or, as the case may be;
 
if an optionee dies, any vested option held by him at the date of death will become exercisable
by  the  optionee’s  lawful  personal representatives,  heirs  or  executors  until  the  earlier  of  one
year after the date of death of such optionee and the date of expiration of the term otherwise
applicable to such option;
 
in  the  case  of  an  optionee  being  dismissed  from employment  or  service  for  cause,  such
optionee’s options, whether or not vested at the date of dismissal, will immediately terminate
without right to exercise same;
 
the  minimum  exercise  price  of  an  option  granted  under  the Plan  must  not  be  less  than  the
Market Price calculated the day before the grant (as defined in the Plan);
(g) Vesting of options shall be in accordance with the option commitment in the Plan or otherwise,
at  the  discretion  of  the  Board,  and will  generally  be  subject  to:  (i)  the  service  provider
remaining employed by or continuing to provide services to the Company or any of its affiliates
as well as, at the discretion of the Board, achieving certain milestones which may be defined
by the Board from time to time or receiving a satisfactory performance review by the Company
or  any  of  its affiliates  during  the  vesting  period;  or  (ii)  the  service  provider remaining  as  a
Director of the Company or any of its affiliates during the vesting period;
– Page 68 –
(h) The  maximum  aggregate  number  of  shares  issuable  upon exercise  of  options  to  non-
employee  directors  must  not  exceed  1%  of  the total  common  shares  of  the  Company
outstanding at any time and no more than $100,000 in total award value per non- employee
director on an annual calendar basis; and
 
The Board reserves the right in its absolute discretion to terminate the Plan with respect to all
Plan shares in respect of Options which have not yet been granted hereunder.
(i)
The Company is of the view that the Plan provides the Company with the flexibility necessary to attract
and  maintain  the  services  of  senior  executives  and  other  employees  and  reflects  in  competing
compensation to other companies in the industry.
The Plan also provides that:
(a) All outstanding but unvested options will vest immediately prior to completion of a Change in
Control (as defined in the Plan);
 
If an option which has been previously granted is set to expire during a period in which trading
in  securities  of  the  Company  by any  participant  is  restricted  by  a  black-out,  or  any  such
blackout  extends to a date which is within five business days of the expiry of the option, the
exercise date will be extended to ten business days after the trading restrictions are lifted; and
(b)
(c) The  Plan  and  outstanding  options  may  be  amended  by  the Board  without  shareholder
approval in the following circumstances:
 
(i)
it  may  make  amendments  which  are  of  a  typographical, grammatical  or  clerical  nature
only;
 
it may change the vesting provisions of an option or the Plan;
 
it may change the termination provision of an option or the Plan which does not entail an
extension beyond the original Expiry Date of an Option;
 
it may add a cashless exercise feature payable in cash or shares to the Plan;
 
it may make amendments necessary as a result of changes in securities laws applicable
to the Company;
 
if the Company becomes listed or quoted on a stock exchange or stock market senior to
the  TSX,  it  may  make  such  amendments  as may  be  required  by  the  policies  of  such
senior stock exchange or stock market; and
 
it may make such amendments as reduce, and do not increase, the benefits of the Plan to
potential optionees.

(4) Mr.  van  Wyk  was  paid  an  annual  salary  of  $323,150  (ZAR 2,544,000)  until  August  2008.
Commencing August 28, 2008, he became a consultant for the Company at a retainer of ZAR

(5) The options granted in the 2008 financial year were granted pursuant to the Stock Option Plan.
For  compensation  purposes,  the Black-Scholes  option  valuation  model  has  been  used  to

PENSION PLAN BENEFITS
The Company has no pension plans for its directors, officers or employees.
TERMINATION AND CHANGE OF CONTROL BENEFITS
The  only  written  employment  contracts  between  the  Company  and  the  NEOs,  in  place  are  with  John
Bristow,  Desmond  Morgan  and  Jeffrey  Brenner.  Hennie  van  Wyk  has  a  consulting  contract  with  the
Company  which  contains  a  change  in  control  provision.  Under  these  agreements,  Messrs.  Bristow,
Morgan, Brenner and van Wyk are required to work full time for the Company and are eligible to receive
stock options and a performance based bonus at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the

(b)
(c)
 
(d)
(e)

any other circumstances which would constitute a constructive dismissal at common law;
 
any breach by the Company of any provision of the employment agreement;
 
the good faith determination by the Employee that, as a result of a Change of Control or any
action or event thereafter, the Employee’s status or responsibilities within the Company have
b e e n diminished  or  the  Employee  is  being  prevented  from  carrying  out  his  duties or
responsibilities as they existed immediately prior to the Change of Control; or
 
the good faith determination by the Employee, based on the standing or business practices of
the good faith determination by the Employee, based on the standing or business practices of
a person or group of persons who acquire control of Rockwell or the assets of Rockwell under
a Change of Control, that it is not in the Employee’s best interest to continue to be employed by
Rockwell in his position at the time of the Change of Control.

(1) These  amounts  represent  the  aggregate  dollar  value  that would  have  been  realized  if  the
options under the option-based award had been exercised on the vesting date. The value of
each  amount  has  been determined by taking the difference between the market price of the
option at date of exercise and the exercise or base price of the option under the option- based
award on the vest date.
C. Board Practices
All directors were elected at the annual general meeting held in November 2007, and have a term of
office expiring at the next annual general meeting of Rockwell expected to be held in November 2009.
.There  are  no  contracts  or  arrangements  under  which  directors  are  compensated  or  provided  benefits
upon termination of employment.
1. Board of Directors
Directors are considered to be independent if they have no direct or indirect material relationship with the
Company. A "material relationship" is a relationship which could, in the view of the Company’s board of
directors, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of a director’s independent judgment.
The Board facilitates its independent supervision over management in a number of ways including: by
holding  regular  meetings  without  the  presence  of  management;  by  retaining  independent  consultants;
and  by  reviewing  corporate  developments  with  larger  shareholders,  analysts  and  potential  industry
partners, where it deems necessary.
The directors of the Company, except Mr. Fisher and Mr. Zungu, are not independent. The Company is
taking steps to ensure that the duties generally performed by independent directors are being performed
by the current directors. The Board members have extensive experience as directors of public companies
and are sensitive to the related corporate governance and financial reporting obligations associated with
such positions. Thus the Board members are reasonably well versed in the obligations of directors and
the expectations of independence from management.
– Page 76 –
The following committees have been established by the members of Rockwell’s board of directors. The
mandate  of  each  committee  is  included  in  the  Company’s  corporate  governance  manual  and  can  be
viewed on the Company’s website (www.rockwelldiamonds.com):
Committee              Membership
Audit Committee
Nominating and Governance
William Fisher
David Copeland
Committee
Compensation Committee
Technical Committee
William Fisher 
Sandile Zungu
Sandile Zungu
Mark Bristow 
David Copeland 
William Fisher
The audit committee is selected annually by the directors of Rockwell at the first meeting of the Board
held after Rockwell's annual general meeting. Its primary function is to review the financial statements of
the  Company  before  they  are  submitted  to  the  Board  for  approval  and  the  audit  committee  is  also
available to assist the Board if required with matters relating to the appointment of Rockwell's auditor and
the  overall  scope  and  results  of  the  audit,  internal  financial  controls,  and  financial  information  for
publication for various purposes.
2. Other Directorships
The section entitled Item 6 – Directors, Senior Management and Employees in this Annual Report gives
details of other reporting issuers of which each director is a director or officer.
3. Orientation and Continuing Education
The  Company  has  traditionally  retained  experienced  mining  people  as  directors  and  hence  the
orientation  needed  is  minimized.  When  new  directors  are  appointed,  they  are  acquainted  with  the
Company’s  mineral  project  and  the  expectations  of  directors.  Board  meetings  generally  include
presentations by the Company’s senior management and project staff in order to give the directors full
insight into the Company’s operations.
4. Ethical Business Conduct
The  Board  has  adopted  an  ethics  policy  which 
the  Company’s  website,
www.rockwelldiamonds.com. The Board also understands that the fiduciary duties placed on individual
directors  by  the  Company’s  governing  corporate  legislation  and  the  common  law  and  the  restrictions
placed  by  applicable  corporate  legislation  on  an  individual  director’s  participation  in  decisions  of  the
Board  in  which  the  director  has  an  interest  have  been  sufficient  to  ensure  that  the  Board  operates
independently of management and in the best interests of the Company.
is  available  on
5. Nomination of Directors
– Page 77 –
The Board considers its size each year when it considers the number of directors required, taking into
account  the  number  required  to  carry  out  the  Board’s  duties  effectively  and  to  maintain  a  diversity  of
views and experience. The Board has a Nominating and Governance Committee, though the full Board
retains responsibility for the recommendation of directors to the Shareholders for election.
6. Compensation
The  Compensation  Committee  considers  compensation  for  the  directors  and  senior  executive  officers
and submits its compensation recommendations to the Board for approval.
7. Other Board Committees
The Board has no committees other than the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee,
Technical Committee and Compensation Committee.
8. Assessments
The Board monitors the adequacy of information given to directors, communication between the Board
and management and the strategic direction and processes of the Board and its committee.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee’s Charter
The audit committee has adopted a charter that sets out its mandate and responsibilities. A copy of the
charter 
audit 
the  Company’s  website,
www.rockwelldiamonds.com.
at www.sedar.com and
committee
is
available
Composition of the Audit Committee
The current member of the audit committee is Messrs. William Fisher., Messrs. Terry Janes and Gregory
Radke resigned from the Board of Directors on June 23, 2009 and June 18, 2009. All members are and
were  considered  to  be  financially  literate  and  are  independent  members  of  the  audit  committee.  The
Company is currently in the process of searching for new audit committee members to replace Messrs.
Janes and Radke.
A  member  of  the  audit  committee  is  independent  if  the  member  has  no  direct  or  indirect  material
relationship with the Company. A material relationship means a relationship which could, in the view of
the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  reasonably  interfere  with  the  exercise  of  a  member’s  independent
judgment.
Relevant Education and Experience
– Page 78 –
As a result of their education and experience, each member of the audit committee has familiarity with, an
understanding of, or experience in:
the accounting principles used by the Company to prepare its financial statements, and the ability to
assess the general application of those principles in connection with estimates, accruals and
reserves;
reviewing or evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of
accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can
reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company's financial statements, and
an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.
A member of the audit committee is considered financially literate if he or she has the ability to read and
understand  a  set  of  financial  statements  that  present  a  breadth  and  level  of  complexity  of  accounting
issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues that can reasonably be
expected to be raised by the Company.
Audit Committee Oversight
The audit committee has not made any recommendations to the Board to nominate or compensate any
external auditor that was not adopted by the Board.
The Company’s auditors, KPMG Inc., have not provided any material non-audit services.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The  Company  has  adopted  specific  policies  and  procedures  for  the  review  and  pre-approval  of  any
services performed by its auditors. The procedures require that all proposed engagements of its auditors
for audit and non-audit services be submitted to the audit committee for approval prior to the beginning of
any such services. The audit committee considers such requests, and, if acceptable to a majority of the
audit committee members, pre-approves such audit and non-audit services by a resolution authorizing
management to engage the Company’s auditors for such audit and non-audit services, with set maximum
dollar  amounts  for  each  itemized  service.  During  such  deliberations,  the  audit  committee  assesses,
among  other  factors,  whether  the  services  requested  would  be  considered  "prohibited  services"  as
contemplated  by  the  regulations  of  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and  whether  the
services requested and the fees related to such services could impair the independence of the auditors.
D. Employees
At February, 2009, Rockwell has 467 direct employees. The Company's administrative and operational
functions are primarily administered in South Africa (see Item 7B).
E. Share Ownership

Share Option Plan
At the Company's Annual and Extraordinary General Meeting held in August 2008, shareholders of the
Company approved a Share Incentive Plan ("2007 Plan") in accordance with the policies of the TSX.
Incentive stock options may be issued to directors, officers, employees or consultants of the Company at
the discretion of the board of directors, subject to an aggregate maximum of 10% of the issued capital of
the Company. This type of share option plan is called a “rolling” plan. Pursuant to the Plan, if outstanding
options  are  exercised,  or  expire,  or  the  number  of  issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of  the
Company increases, the number of options available to grant under the Plan increases proportionately.
Options can have a maximum term of five years and typically terminate 90 days following the termination
of  the  optionee's  employment  or  engagement,  except  in  the  case  of  retirement  or  death.  Vesting  of
options is at the discretion of the board of directors at the time the options are granted.
The Option Plan is subject to restrictions that:
(j)
(ii)
the number of shares issuable to insiders as a group under the Option Plan, when combined
with shares issuable to insiders under all the Company’s other security based compensation
plans may not exceed 10% of the issued shares within any 12 month period;
 
the  number  of  shares  issuable  to  insiders  as  a  group under  the  New  Option  Plan,  when
combined  with  shares  issuable  to  insiders under  all  the  Company’s  other  security  based
compensation plans, may not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued shares; and
(iii) no exercise price of an option granted to an insider may be reduced nor an extension to the
term of an option granted to an insider extended without further approval of the disinterested
shareholders of the Company.
Options under the Option Plan must be granted at a price no lower than the five day volume weighted
average trading price of the shares, which is calculated by dividing the total value of the securities traded
for the relevant period by the total volume. Where appropriate, the TSX may exclude internal crosses and
certain other special terms trades from the calculation.
The continuity of share purchase options as at May 31, 2009 is as follows:

ITEM 7. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A. Major Shareholders
Rockwell's  securities  are  recorded  on  the  books  of  its  transfer  agent  in  registered  form,  however,  the
majority  of  such  shares  are  registered  in  the  name  of  intermediaries  such  as  brokerage  houses  and
clearing houses on behalf of their respective brokerage clients, and Rockwell does not have knowledge
of or access to information about of the beneficial owners thereof. To the best of its knowledge, Rockwell
is  not  directly  or  indirectly  owned  or  controlled  by  a  foreign  government.  As  of  February  28,  2009,
Rockwell had authorized an unlimited number of common shares without par value of which 238,041,569
were issued and outstanding.
"Beneficial ownership" means the sole or shared power to vote or direct the voting or to dispose or direct
the disposition of any security. A person is deemed to have beneficial ownership of any securities that
such person has a right to acquire within 60 days of the fiscal period through the exercise of any option or
warrant. Any security that any person has the right to acquire within 60 days is deemed outstanding for
the purpose of calculating the ownership of such person, but is not deemed to be outstanding for the
purpose of calculating the ownership percentage of any other person.
Under the British Columbia Securities  Act insiders (generally officers, directors, and holders of 10% or
more of Rockwell's shares) are required to file insider reports of changes in their ownership within ten
days of a trade in Rockwell's securities. Copies of such reports are available for public inspection at the
offices of the British Columbia Securities Commission, 9th Floor, 701 West Georgia Street, Vancouver,
British Columbia V7Y 1L2 (phone (604) 899-6500) or at Canadian Securities Administrators website for
Insiders' Disclosure, www.sedi.ca.
As at August 21, 2009 there were no current registered filed shareholding position of greater than 5%.
As of August 21, 2009, directors and officers of Rockwell in total (6 persons) own or control an aggregate
of  4,912,945  common  shares  of  the  Company  (2.06%)  .  These  directors  or  officers  do  not  have  any
different  voting  rights  with  respect  to  the  common  shares  held  by  them.  Under  the  British  Columbia
Securities Act, insiders (generally officers, directors, holders of 10% or more of the Company's shares)
are required to file insider reports of changes in their ownership in the first 10 days following a trade in
Rockwell's securities. Under British Columbia securities laws, insider trading information is available at
www.sedi.ca
– Page 82 –
As  at  August  21,  2009,  to  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  the  following  is  the  geographic
distribution of shareholders. Shares registered in intermediaries were assumed to be held by residents of
the same country in which the clearing house was located.

date result in a change of control of Rockwell.
B. Related Party Transactions
No director or senior officer, and no associate or affiliate of the foregoing persons, and no insider has or
has  had  any  material  interest,  direct  or  indirect,  in  any  other  transactions,  or  in  any  other  proposed

Related  Party  transactions  are  explained  below.  These  arrangements  and  transactions  have  typically
been  established  to  provide  professional  and  cost  effective  services  and  resources  to  Rockwell.  In

areas it is difficult to obtain key services and make purchases of certain supplies on an as needed basis.
Likewise security consideration is paramount given the high value product produced by the Company.

projects  (Kwartelspan,  Zwemkuil-Mooidraai,  and  Remhooget-Holsloot)  referred  to  collectively  as  the
Middle Orange River Operations (“MORO”) from Trans Hex Operations (Pty) Ltd. Registration and transfer
of Saxendrift Mine Pty (Ltd) and the Saxendrift mining right, as well as prospecting rights in respect of the
Kwartelspan, Zwemkuil-Mooidraai and part of the Remhoogte-Holsloot projects were obtained. In March
2009, the Niewejaarskraal mining rights occurred on March 4, 2009, subsequent to year end. Rockwell
has chosen not to exercise the option on the Remhoogte prospecting right due to current harsh financial
constraints and depressed diamond prices.

B. Notice of Articles and Articles
Copies of Rockwell's memorandum and articles of incorporation, as registered with the British Columbia
Registrar of Companies under Corporation No. 354545, were filed with the Company's initial registration
statement  on  Form  20-F  filed  in  2000.  The Business  Corporations  Act (British  Columbia)  (the  "BCA")
came into force on March 29, 2004. As a result, the Company Act (British Columbia) was repealed, and
the Company became a "pre-existing company" subject to the provisions of the BCA. Every pre-existing
company is required under the BCA to file a Transition Application containing a notice of articles with the
British  Columbia  Registrar  of  Companies,  as  a  result  of  which  the  notice  of  articles  supersedes  and
replaces the company's memorandum. The Company has caused a Transition Application to be filed with
the British Columbia Registrar of Companies, and its notice of articles and the related articles are being
filed as exhibits to this Annual Report.
A discussion of the notice of articles and articles of Rockwell follows:
Objects and Purposes
Rockwell's Notice of Articles do not specify objects or purposes. Under British Columbia law, a British
Columbia  corporation  has  all  the  legal  powers  of  a  natural  person;  however  corporations  may  not
undertake  certain  limited  business  activities  such  as  operating  as  a  trust  company  or  railroad  without
alterations to its form of articles and specific government consent.
Directors – Powers and Limitations
Rockwell's articles do not specify a maximum number of directors (the minimum under British Columbia
law for a public company is three). The articles specify that the number of directors shall be the number of
directors fixed by shareholders annually or the number that are actually elected at a general shareholders
meeting. The number of directors is determined annually by shareholders at the annual Shareholders
meeting and all directors are elected at that time, there are no staggered directorships. Under the articles
the directors are entitled between successive annual general meeting to appoint one or more additional
directors but not more than one-third of the number of directors fixed at a shareholders meeting or actually
elected at the preceding annual general meeting. Directors automatically retire at the commencement of
each annual meeting subject to being re-elected.
Under the articles, a director who is any way directly or indirectly interested in a proposed contract or
transaction  with  Rockwell  or  who  holds  any  office  or  possesses  any  property  whereby  directly  or
indirectly a duty might be created which would conflict with his duty or interest as a director shall declare
the nature and extent of such interest in such contract or transaction. A director shall not vote in respect of
any such contract or transaction if the company in which he is interested and if he should vote his vote
shall not be counted but shall be counted in the quorum present at the meeting. Similarly, under the BCA
directors are obligated to abstain from voting on matters in which they may be financially interested after
fully disclosing such interest. Directors must abstain in such circumstances both under the articles and
under the BCA.
Directors  must  be  of  the  age  of  majority  (18),  and  meet  eligibility  criteria  including  not  being  mentally
infirm, an undischarged bankrupt, no fraud related convictions in the previous five years and a majority of
directors  must  be  ordinarily  resident  in  Canada.  There  is  no  mandatory  retirement  age  either  under
Rockwell's articles or under the BCA.
– Page 89 –
The  directors  may  from  time  to  time  at  their  discretion  authorize  the  Company  to  borrow  any  sum  of
money  for  the  purposes  of  the  Company  and  may  raise  or  secure  the  repayment  of  that  sum  in  such
manner upon such terms and conditions, in all respects, as they think fit, and in particular, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, by the issue of bonds or debentures, or any mortgage or charge,
whether specific or floating, or other security on the undertaking or the whole or any part of the property of
the Company, both present and future. Directors need not own any shares of the Company in order to
qualify as directors.
Rights and Restrictions attached to Shares
The directors may declare dividends and fix the date of record therefore and the date for payment thereof.
No notice need be given of the declaration of any dividend.
Subject to the terms of shares with special rights or restrictions, all dividends shall be declared according
to the number of shares held and no dividend shall bear interest against Rockwell.
The directors may direct payment of any dividend wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets or
of  paid-up  shares,  bonds,  debentures  or  other  debt  obligations  of  Rockwell,  or  in  any  one  or  more  of
those ways, and where any difficult arises in regard to the distribution, the directors may settle the same
as they think expedient, and in particular may fix the value for distribution of specific assets or of paid-up
shares, bonds, debentures or other debt obligations of Rockwell, or in any one or more of those ways,
and, where any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the directors may settle the same as they
think expedient, and in particular may fix the value for distribution of specific assets, and may determine
the cash payments shall be made to a member upon the basis of the value so fixed in place of fractional
shares, bonds, debentures or other debt obligations in order to adjust the rights of all parties, and may
vest  any  of  those  specific  assets  in  trustees  upon  such  trusts  for  the  persons  entitled  as  may  seem
expedient to the directors.
Notwithstanding anything contained in Rockwell's articles the directors may from time to time capitalize
any undistributed surplus on hand of Rockwell and may from time to time issue as fully paid and non-
assessable any unissued shares or any bonds, debentures or other debt obligations of Rockwell as a
dividend representing such undistributed surplus on hand or any part thereof.
Any dividend, interest or other moneys payable in cash in respect of shares may be paid by cheque or
warrant  sent  through  the  post  directed  to  the  registered  address  of  the  holder,  or,  in  the  case  of  joint
holders, to the registered address of that one of the joint holders who is first named on the register or to
such person and to such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such cheque
or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent. Any one of two or more
joint holders may give effectual receipts for any dividends, bonuses or other moneys payable in respect of
the shares held by them as joint holders.
A transfer of a share shall not pass the right to any dividend declared thereon before the registration of the
transfer in the register.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the articles should any dividend result in any shareholders being
entitled  to  a  fractional  part  of  a  share  of  Rockwell,  the  directors  shall  have  the  right  to  pay  such
shareholders in place of that fractional share, the cash equivalent thereof calculated on the par value
thereof, or in the case of shares without nominal or par value, calculated on the price or consideration for
which such shares were or were deemed to be issued, and shall have the further right and complete
discretion to carry out such distribution and to adjust the rights of the shareholders with respect thereto on
as practical and equitable a basis as possible including the right to arrange through a fiscal agent or
otherwise  for  the  sale,  consolidation  or  other  disposition  of  those  fractional  shares  on  behalf  of  those
shareholders of Rockwell.
– Page 90 –
The directors may, before declaring any dividend, set aside out of the profits of Rockwell such sums as
they  think  proper  as  appropriations  from  income  which  shall  at  the  discretion  of  the  directors,  be
applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for any other purpose to which the
profits of Rockwell may be properly applied, and pending such application may, either be employed in
the business of Rockwell or be invested in such investments as the directors in their discretion may from
time to time determine.
Changes to Rights of Common Shareholders
Changes to the articles and memorandum of Rockwell can be changed by a "special resolution", being a
resolution passed by not less than 75% of the shares voted in person or by proxy at a duly convened
shareholders meeting. Some corporate changes including amalgamation with another company, sale of
substantially all of Rockwell's assets, re-domiciling out of the jurisdiction of British Columbia, creation of
new classes of shares not only require such 75% approval but generally also give rise to a dissent right
which  is  the  right  to  be  paid  the  fair  value  of  the  stockholder's  shares  in  cash  if  the  required  special
resolution is actually passed and Rockwell elects to proceed with the matter notwithstanding receipt of
dissent notices. A notice of a shareholders meeting at which such an action is intended to be effected
must include a prominent notice of the dissent right. Dissent provisions governed by the BCA and not by
the articles of Rockwell.
Shareholders Meetings
Shareholders meetings are only peripherally governed by the articles of Rockwell with most shareholder
protections  contained  in  the Securities  Act (British  Columbia)  and  the  BCA.  The  articles  provide  that
Rockwell will hold an annual general meeting, will provide at least 21 days' notice and will provide for
certain procedural matters and rules of order with respect to conduct of the meeting. The Securities Act
(British  Columbia)  and  the  BCA  superimpose  requirements  that  generally  provide  that  shareholders
meetings require not less than a 60 day period from initial public notice that Rockwell makes a thorough
advanced  search  of  intermediary  and  brokerage  registered  shareholdings  to  ascertain  location  of
beneficial shareholders so that materials can be sent, the form and content of information circulars and
proxies and like matters typically governed by such securities legislation. This legislation specifies the
disclosure  requirements  for  various  corporate  actions,  background  information  on  the  nominees  for
election for director, executive compensation paid in the previous year and full details of any unusual
matters. Rockwell must hold an annual shareholders meeting within 13 months of the previous annual
shareholders meeting and must present audited statements that are no more than 180 days old at that
meeting.
Redemption
Subject  to  the  special  rights  and  restrictions  attached  to  any  class  of  shares,  Rockwell  may,  by  a
resolution of the directors and in compliance with the BCA, redeem any of its shares that have a right of
redemption  attached  thereto  at  the  price  and  upon  the  terms  specified  in  such  resolution  and  where
Rockwell purposes to redeem some, but not all, of its shares of a particular class or kind, it shall not be
obligated to redeem them pro rata but may redeem them in any manner the directors in their absolute
discretion may deem fit.
Rockwell has no redeemable securities authorized or issued.
Pre-emptive Rights
– Page 91 –
There are no pre-emptive rights applicable to Rockwell which provide a right to any person to participate
in offerings of Rockwell's securities
Liquidation
All common shares of Rockwell participate ratably in any available assets in the event of a winding up or
other liquidation.
No Limitation on Foreign Ownership
There  are  no  limitations  under  Rockwell's  Articles  or  in  the  BCA  on  the  right  of  persons  who  are  not
citizens of Canada to hold or vote common shares. (See also "Exchange Controls" – below.)
Dividends
Dividends  may  be  declared  by  the  Board  out  of  available  assets  and  are  paid  rateably  to  holders  of
common shares. No dividend may be paid if Rockwell is, or would thereby become, insolvent.
Voting Rights
Each Rockwell share is entitled to one vote on matters to which common shares ordinarily vote including
the election of directors, appointment of auditors and approval of corporate changes and other matters
requiring shareholder approval.
Change in Control
Rockwell has not implemented any shareholders' rights against possible take-overs. Rockwell does not
have  any  agreements  which  are  triggered  by  a  take-over  or  other  change  of  control.  There  are  no
provisions in its articles triggered by or affected by a change in outstanding shares which gives rise to a
change in control.
Share Ownership Reporting
The  articles  of  Rockwell  do  not  require  disclosure  of  share  ownership.  Share  ownership  of  director
nominees must be reported annually in proxy materials sent to Rockwell's shareholders. There are no
requirements  under  British  Columbia  corporate  law  to  report  ownership  of  shares  of  Rockwell  but  the
British  Columbia  Securities  Act  requires  disclosure  of  trading  by  insiders  including  holders  of  10%  of
voting shares within 10 days of the trade. Controlling shareholders (generally those in excess of 20% of
outstanding shares) must provide seven days advance notice of share sales.
C. Material Contracts
Rockwell's material contracts are included in the exhibits list in item 19.
D. Exchange Controls
Rockwell is a Canadian corporation incorporated under the laws of British Columbia. There is no law or
governmental decree or regulation in Canada that restricts the export or import of capital, or affects the
remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to a non-resident holder of Common Shares, other
than withholding tax requirements. Any such remittances to United States residents are generally subject
to withholding tax. See "Taxation" below.
– Page 92 –
There is no limitation imposed by the laws of Canada or by the charter or other constituent documents of
Rockwell on the right of a non-resident to hold or vote the Common Shares, other than as provided in the
Investment  Canada  Act (Canada)  (the  "Investment  Act").  The  following  discussion  summarizes  the
material features of the Investment Act for a non-resident who proposes to acquire a controlling number of
Common Shares. It is general only, it is not a substitute for independent advice from an investor's own
advisor, and it does not anticipate statutory or regulatory amendments. Rockwell does not believe the
Investment Act will have any affect on it or on its non-Canadian shareholders due to a number of factors
including the nature of its operations and Rockwell's relatively small capitalization.
The Investment  Act generally  prohibits  implementation  of  a  reviewable  investment  by  an  individual,
government or agency thereof, corporation, partnership, trust or joint venture (each an "entity") that is not
a  "Canadian"  as  defined  in  the Investment  Act (a "non-Canadian"), unless after review the Director of
Investments appointed by the minister responsible for the Investment Act is satisfied that the investment is
likely to be of net benefit to Canada. The size and nature of a proposed transaction may give rise to an
obligation to notify the Director to seek an advance ruling. An investment in the Common Shares by a
non-Canadian other than a "WTO Investor" (as that term is defined in the Investment Act and which term
includes  entities  which  are  nationals  of  or  are  controlled  by  nationals  of  member  states  of  the  World
Trade Organization) when Rockwell was not controlled by a WTO Investor, would be reviewable under
the Investment  Act if it was an investment to acquire control of Rockwell and the value of the assets of
Rockwell, as determined in accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Investment Act, was
$5 million or more, or if an order for review was made by the federal cabinet on the grounds that the
investment related to Canada's cultural heritage or national identity, regardless of the value of the assets
of  Rockwell.  An  investment  in  the  Common  Shares  by  a  WTO  Investor,  or  by  a  non-Canadian  when
Rockwell was controlled by a WTO Investor, would be reviewable under the Investment Act if it was an
investment  to  acquire  control  of  Rockwell  and  the  value  of  the  assets  of  Rockwell,  as  determined  in
accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Investment Act, was not less than a specified
amount, which for 2005 exceeds $250 million. A non-Canadian would acquire control of Rockwell for the
purposes  of  the Investment  Act if  the  non-Canadian  acquired  a  majority  of  the  Common  Shares.  The
acquisition of less than a majority but one-third or more of the Common Shares would be presumed to be
an acquisition of control of Rockwell unless it could be established that, on the acquisition, Rockwell was
not controlled in fact by the acquiror through the ownership of the Common Shares.
The foregoing assumes Rockwell will not engage in the production of uranium or own an interest in a
producing uranium property in Canada, or provide any financial service or transportation service, as the
rules governing these businesses are different.
Certain transactions relating to the Common Shares would be exempt from the Investment Act, including
(a) an acquisition of the Common Shares by a person in the ordinary course of that person's business as
a trader or dealer in securities,
(b) an acquisition of control of Rockwell in connection with the realization of security granted for a loan or
other financial assistance and not for a purpose related to the provisions of the Investment Act, and
(c)  an  acquisition  of  control  of  Rockwell  by  reason  of  an  amalgamation,  merger,  consolidation  or
corporate reorganization following which the ultimate direct or indirect control in fact of Rockwell, through
the ownership of the Common Shares, remained unchanged.
E. Taxation
– Page 93 –
Material Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences for United States Residents
The following, in management's understanding, summarizes the principal Canadian federal income tax
consequences generally applicable to the holding and disposition of Common Shares by a holder (in this
summary, a "U.S. Holder") who, at all relevant times, (a) for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada)
(the "Tax Act"), is not resident in Canada, deals at arm's length with Rockwell, holds the Common Shares
as  capital  property  and  does  not  use  or  hold  the  Common  Shares  in  the  course  of  carrying  on,  or
otherwise  in  connection  with,  a  business  in  Canada,  and  (b)  for  the  purposes  of  the  Canada-United
States Income Tax Convention, 1980 (the "Treaty"), is a resident solely of the United States, has never
been a resident of Canada, and has not held or used (and does not hold or use) Common Shares in
connection with a permanent establishment or fixed base in Canada. This summary does not apply to
traders or dealers in securities, persons who acquired their Common Shares in a transaction considered
for  purposes  of  the  Tax  Act  to  be  an  adventure  or  concern  in  the  nature  of  trade,  limited  liability
companies,  tax-exempt  entities,  insurers,  financial  institutions  (including  those  to  which  the  mark-to-
market provisions of the Tax Act apply), or any other U.S. Holder to which special considerations apply.
This summary is based on the current provisions of the Tax Act including all regulations there under, the
Treaty, all proposed amendments to the Tax Act, the regulations and the Treaty publicly announced by or
on behalf of the Minister of Finance to the date hereof, and the current published administrative practices
of  the  Canada  Customs  and  Revenue  Agency.  It  has  been  assumed  that  all  currently  proposed
amendments  will  be  enacted  as  proposed  and  that  there  will  be  no  other  relevant  change  in  any
governing law or administrative practice, although no assurances can be given in these respects. This
summary does not take into account provincial, U.S., state or other foreign income tax law or practice.
The tax consequences to any particular U.S. Holder will vary according to the status of that holder as an
individual, trust, corporation or other entity, the jurisdictions in which that holder is subject to taxation, and
generally according to that holder's particular circumstances. Accordingly, this summary is not, and is not
to be construed as, Canadian tax advice to any particular U.S. Holder. U.S. Holders should consult with
their own tax advisors for advice with respect to their own particular circumstances.
Dividends
Dividends paid or credited or deemed to be paid or credited to a U.S. Holder by Rockwell will normally be
subject to Canadian withholding tax. Under the Treaty, the rate of withholding tax on dividends paid to a
U.S. Holder that beneficially owns such dividends is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the
dividend  (or  5%  if  the  U.S.  Holder  is  a  corporation  and  beneficially  owns  at  least  10%  of  Rockwell's
voting  shares).  Rockwell  will  be  required  to  withhold  the  applicable  withholding  tax  from  any  such
dividend and remit it to the Canadian government for the U.S. Holder's account.
Disposition
A  U.S.  Holder  is  not  subject  to  tax  under  the  Tax  Act  in  respect  of  a  capital  gain  realized  on  the
disposition of a Common Share provided that the share is not "taxable Canadian property" to the holder
thereof. If the Common Shares are listed on a prescribed stock exchange, which currently includes the
American Stock Exchange, a Common Share generally will not be taxable Canadian property to a U.S.
Holder if, at any time during the 60 months preceding the disposition, the U.S. Holder or persons with
whom the U.S. Holder did not deal at arm's length alone or together owned, or had an interest or option in
respect of 25% or more of Rockwell's issued shares of any class or series.
– Page 94 –
A U.S. Holder whose Common Shares do constitute taxable Canadian property, and who might therefore
be  liable  for  Canadian  income  tax  under  the  Tax  Act  on  a  disposition  or  deemed  disposition  of  such
shares, will generally be relieved from such liability under the Treaty unless the value of the shares of the
Company at the time of disposition is derived principally from real property situated in Canada within the
meaning of the Treaty. Management of Rockwell believes that the value of Rockwell's Common Shares
is not currently derived principally from real property situated in Canada. U.S. Holders whose Common
Shares  are  taxable  Canadian  property  should  consult  their  own  advisors  regarding  filing  and  other
Canadian federal tax considerations.
United States Tax Consequences
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is, in the opinion of Rockwell after consultation with its professional advisors, a general
discussion  of  material  United  States  federal  income  tax  consequences,  under  current  law,  generally
applicable to a U.S. Holder (as hereinafter defined) of common shares of Rockwell. This discussion does
not address all potentially relevant federal income tax matters and it does not address consequences
peculiar  to  persons  subject  to  special  provisions  of  federal  income  tax  law,  such  as  those  described
below as excluded from the definition of a U.S. Holder. In addition, this discussion does not cover any
state, local or foreign tax consequences, (see Item 10E "Taxation – Material Canadian Federal Income
Tax Consequences for United States Residents" above). Accordingly, holders and prospective holders of
common shares of Rockwell are urged to consult their own tax advisors about the specific federal, state,
local, and foreign tax consequences to them of purchasing, owning and disposing of common shares of
Rockwell, based upon their individual circumstances.
The following discussion is based upon the sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the  "Code"),  Treasury  Regulations,  published  Internal  Revenue  Service  ("IRS")  rulings,  published
administrative positions of the IRS and court decisions that are currently applicable, any or all of which
could be materially and adversely changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, at any time and which are
subject to differing interpretations. This discussion does not consider the potential effects, both adverse
and beneficial, of any proposed legislation which, if enacted, could be applied, possibly on a retroactive
basis, at any time.
U.S. Holders
As  used  herein,  a  "U.S.  Holder"  means  a  holder  of  common  shares  of  Rockwell  who  is  a  citizen  or
individual resident of the United States, a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the
laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof, an entity created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof which has elected to be treated as a
corporation for United States federal income tax purposes (under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701
-3), an estate whose income is taxable in the United States irrespective of source or a trust subject to the
primary  supervision  of  a  court  within  the  United  States  and  control  of  a  United  States  fiduciary  as
described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code. This summary does not address the tax consequences to,
and U.S. Holder does not include, persons subject to specific provisions of federal income tax law, such
as  tax-exempt  organizations,  qualified  retirement  plans,  individual  retirement  accounts  and  other  tax-
deferred  accounts,  financial  institutions,  insurance  companies,  real  estate  investment  trusts,  regulated
investment  companies,  broker-dealers,  non-resident  alien  individuals,  persons  or  entities  that  have  a
"functional  currency"  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  shareholders  subject  to  the  alternative  minimum  tax,
shareholders  who  hold  common  shares  as  part  of  a  straddle,  hedging  or  conversion  transaction,  and
shareholders  who  acquired  their  common  shares  through  the  exercise  of  employee  stock  options  or
otherwise  as  compensation  for  services.  This  summary  is  limited  to  U.S.  Holders  who  own  common
shares as capital assets and who own (directly and indirectly, pursuant to applicable rules of constructive
ownership) no more than 5% of the value of the total outstanding stock of Rockwell. This summary does
not  address  the  consequences  to  a  person  or  entity  holding  an  interest  in  a  shareholder  or  the
consequences  to  a  person  of  the  ownership,  exercise  or  disposition  of  any  options,  warrants  or  other
rights to acquire common shares. In addition, this summary does not address special rules applicable to
United States persons (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) holding common shares through a
foreign partnership or to foreign persons holding common shares through a domestic partnership.
Distribution on Common Shares of Rockwell
– Page 95 –
To the extent that a distribution paid to a U.S. holder on its common stock is not an excess distribution
and is not a non-taxable distribution paid from earnings and profits previously included in income by a
U.S. holder that has made a QEF election, the gross amount of such distribution (including any amount
deducted in respect of withholding taxes) will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax as foreign
source ordinary dividend income to the extent such a distribution is paid out of the Company's current or
accumulated  earnings  and  profits.  Such  Canadian  tax  withheld  may  be  credited,  subject  to  certain
limitations,  against  the  U.S.  Holder's  federal  income  tax  liability  or,  alternatively,  may  be  deducted  in
computing the U.S. Holder's federal taxable income by those who itemize deductions. (See more detailed
discussion at "Foreign Tax Credit" below). To the extent that distributions exceed current or accumulated
earnings and profits of Rockwell, they will be treated first as a return of capital up to the U.S. Holder's
adjusted  basis  in  the  Common  Shares  and  thereafter  as  gain  from  the  sale  or  exchange  of  property.
Preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains are applicable to a U.S. Holder which is an individual,
estate or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains for a U.S. Holder
which is a corporation.
In the case of foreign currency received as a dividend that is not converted by the recipient into U.S.
dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency equal to its U.S.
dollar value on the date of receipt. Generally any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or
other disposition of the foreign currency, including the exchange for U.S. dollars, will be ordinary income
or loss. However, an individual whose realized gain does not exceed $200 will not recognize that gain,
provided  that  there  are  no  expenses  associated  with  the  transaction  that  meet  the  requirements  for
deductibility as a trade or business expense (other than travel expenses in connection with a business
trip) or as an expense for the production of income.
Dividends  paid  on  the  common  shares  of  Rockwell  generally  will  not  be  eligible  for  the  dividends
received deduction provided to corporations receiving dividends from certain United States corporations.
A U.S. Holder which is a corporation and which owns shares representing at least 10% of the voting
power and value of Rockwell may, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a 70% (or 80% if the U.S.
Holder owns shares representing at least 20% of the voting power and value of Rockwell) deduction of
the United States source portion of dividends received from Rockwell (unless Rockwell qualifies as a
"foreign  personal  holding  company"  or  a  "passive  foreign  investment  company,"  as  defined  below).
Rockwell does not anticipate that it will earn any United States income, however, and therefore does not
anticipate that any U.S. Holder will be eligible for the dividends received deduction.
Under current Treasury Regulations, dividends paid on Rockwell's common shares, if any, generally will
not be subject to information reporting and generally will not be subject to U.S. backup withholding tax.
However, dividends and the proceeds from a sale of Rockwell's common shares paid in the U.S. through
a  U.S.  or  U.S.  related  paying  agent  (including  a  broker)  will  be  subject  to  U.S.  information  reporting
requirements and may also be subject to the 28% U.S. backup withholding tax, unless the paying agent
is furnished with a duly completed and signed Form W-9. Any amounts withheld under the U.S. backup
withholding tax rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income
tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.
Foreign Tax Credit
– Page 96 –
A U.S. Holder who pays (or has withheld from distributions) Canadian income tax with respect to the
ownership  of  common  shares  of  Rockwell  may  be  entitled,  at  the  option  of  the  U.S.  Holder,  to  either
receive  a  deduction  or  a  tax  credit  for  such  foreign  tax  paid  or  withheld.  Generally,  it  will  be  more
advantageous to claim a credit because a credit reduces United States federal income taxes on a dollar-
for-dollar basis, while a deduction merely reduces the taxpayer's income subject to tax. This election is
made on a year-by-year basis and generally applies to all foreign taxes paid by (or withheld from) the
U.S.  Holder  during  that  year.  There  are  significant  and  complex  limitations  which  apply  to  the  credit,
among which is the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the proportionate share of the U.S.
Holder's United States income tax liability that the U.S. Holder's foreign source income bears to his or its
worldwide taxable income. In the determination of the application of this limitation, the various items of
income and deduction must be classified into foreign and domestic sources. Complex rules govern this
classification process. In addition, this limitation is calculated separately with respect to specific classes
of  income  such  as  "passive  income,"  "high  withholding  tax  interest,"  "financial  services  income,"
"shipping  income,"  and  certain  other  classifications  of  income.  Dividends  distributed  by  Rockwell  will
generally constitute "passive income" or, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, "financial services income"
for these purposes. The availability of the foreign tax credit and the application of the limitations on the
credit are fact specific, and U.S. Holders of common shares of Rockwell should consult their own tax
advisors regarding their individual circumstances.
Disposition of Common Shares of Rockwell
In general, U.S. Holders will recognize gain or loss upon the sale of common shares of Rockwell equal to
the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received,
and  (ii)  the  shareholder's  tax  basis  in  the  common  shares  of  Rockwell.  Preferential  tax  rates  apply  to
long-term capital gains of U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts. In general, gain or loss on
the sale of common shares of Rockwell will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares are a
capital asset in the hands of the U.S. Holder and are held for more than one year. Deductions for net
capital losses are subject to significant limitations. For U.S. Holders that are not corporations, any unused
portion of such net capital loss may be carried over to be used in later tax years until such net capital loss
is  thereby  exhausted.  For  U.S.  Holders  that  are  corporations  (other  than  corporations  subject  to
Subchapter  S  of  the  Code),  an  unused  net  capital  loss  may  be  carried  back  three  years  and  carried
forward five years from the loss year to be offset against capital gains until such net capital loss is thereby
exhausted.
Other Considerations
Set  forth  below  are  certain  material  exceptions  to  the  above-described  general  rules  describing  the
United States federal income tax consequences resulting from the holding and disposition of common
shares:
Passive Foreign Investment Company
United States income tax law contains rules governing "passive foreign investment companies" ("PFIC")
which can have significant tax effects on U.S. Holders of foreign corporations. These rules do not apply to
non-U.S. Holders. Section 1297 of the Code defines a PFIC as a corporation that is not formed in the
United  States  if,  for  any  taxable  year,  either  (i)  75%  or  more  of  its  gross  income  is  "passive  income,"
which includes interest, dividends and certain rents and royalties or (ii) the average percentage, by fair
market value (or, if the corporation is not publicly traded and either is a controlled foreign corporation or
makes  an  election,  by  adjusted  tax  basis),  of  its  assets  that  produce  or  are  held  for  the  production  of
"passive income" is 50% or more. In the event that Rockwell qualifies as a PFIC for the fiscal year ending
February 28, 2009 as well as in future fiscal years each U.S. Holder of Rockwell is urged to consult a tax
advisor with respect to how the PFIC rules affect such U.S. Holder's tax situation.
– Page 97 –
Each U.S. Holder who holds stock in a foreign corporation during any year in which such corporation
qualifies as a PFIC is subject to United States federal income taxation under one of three alternative tax
regimes at the election of such U.S. Holder. The following is a discussion of such alternative tax regimes
applied to such U.S. Holders of Rockwell. In addition, special rules apply if a foreign corporation qualifies
as  both  a  PFIC  and  a  "controlled  foreign  corporation"  (as  defined  below)  and  a  U.S.  Holder  owns,
actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled
to vote of such foreign corporation (See more detailed discussion at "Controlled Foreign Corporation"
below).
A U.S. Holder who elects to treat Rockwell as a qualified electing fund ("QEF") will be subject, under
Section 1293 of the Code, to current federal income tax for any taxable year to which the election applies
in which Rockwell qualifies as a PFIC on his pro rata share of Rockwell's (i) "net capital gain" (the excess
of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), which will be taxed as long-term capital
gain, and (ii) "ordinary earnings" (the excess of earnings and profits over net capital gain), which will be
taxed  as  ordinary  income,  in  each  case,  for  the  shareholder's  taxable  year  in  which  (or  with  which)
Rockwell's  taxable  year  ends,  regardless  of  whether  such  amounts  are  actually  distributed.  A  U.S.
Holder's tax basis in the common shares will be increased by any such amount that is included in income
but not distributed.
The  procedure  a  U.S.  Holder  must  comply  with  in  making  an  effective  QEF  election,  and  the
consequences of such election, will depend on whether the year of the election is the first year in the U.S.
Holder's holding period in which Rockwell is a PFIC. If the U.S. Holder makes a QEF election in such first
year, i.e., a "timely" QEF election, then the U.S. Holder may make the QEF election by simply filing the
appropriate  documents  at  the  time  the  U.S.  Holder  files  his  tax  return  for  such  first  year.  If,  however,
Rockwell qualified as a PFIC in a prior year during the U.S. Holder's holding period, then, in order to
avoid the Section 1291 rules discussed below, in addition to filing documents, the U.S. Holder must elect
to recognize under the rules of Section 1291 of the Code (discussed herein), (i) any gain that he would
otherwise  recognize  if  the  U.S.  Holder  sold  his  stock  on  the  qualification  date  or  (ii)  if  Rockwell  is  a
controlled  foreign  corporation,  the  U.S.  Holder's  pro  rata  share  of  Rockwell's  post-1986  earnings  and
profits  as  of  the  qualification  date.  The  qualification  date  is  the  first  day  of  Rockwell's  first  tax  year  in
which Rockwell qualified as a QEF with respect to such U.S. Holder. For purposes of this discussion, a
U.S. Holder who makes (i) a timely QEF election, or (ii) an untimely QEF election and either of the above-
described  gain-recognition  elections  under  Section  1291  is  referred  to  herein  as  an  "Electing  U.S.
Holder."  A  U.S.  Holder  who  holds  common  shares  at  any  time  during  a  year  of  Rockwell  in  which
Rockwell  is  a  PFIC  and  who  is  not  an  Electing  U.S.  Holder  (including  a  U.S.  Holder  who  makes  an
untimely QEF election and makes neither of the above-described gain-recognition elections) is referred to
herein as a "Non-Electing U.S. Holder". An Electing U.S. Holder (i) generally treats any gain realized on
the disposition of his Company common shares as capital gain; and (ii) may either avoid interest charges
resulting from PFIC status altogether, or make an annual election, subject to certain limitations, to defer
payment  of  current  taxes  on  his  share  of  Rockwell's  annual  realized  net  capital  gain  and  ordinary
earnings  subject,  however,  to  an  interest  charge.  If  the  U.S.  Holder  is  not  a  corporation,  any  interest
charge imposed under the PFIC regime would be treated as "personal interest" that is not deductible.
In  order  for  a  U.S.  Holder  to  make  (or  maintain)  a  valid  QEF  election,  Rockwell  must  provide  certain
information regarding its net capital gains and ordinary earnings and permit its books and records to be
examined to verify such information. Rockwell intends to make the necessary information available to
U.S. Holders to permit them to make (and maintain) QEF elections with respect to Rockwell. Rockwell
urges each U.S. Holder to consult a tax advisor regarding the availability of, and procedure for making,
the QEF election.
– Page 98 –
A QEF election, once made with respect to Rockwell, applies to the tax year for which it was made and to
all  subsequent  tax  years,  unless  the  election  is  invalidated  or  terminated,  or  the  IRS  consents  to
revocation of the election. If a QEF election is made by a U.S. Holder and Rockwell ceases to qualify as a
PFIC in a subsequent tax year, the QEF election will remain in effect, although not applicable, during
those tax years in which Rockwell does not qualify as a PFIC. Therefore, if Rockwell again qualifies as a
PFIC in a subsequent tax year, the QEF election will be effective and the U.S. Holder will be subject to
the rules described above for Electing U.S. Holders in such tax year and any subsequent tax years in
which  Rockwell  qualifies  as  a  PFIC.  In  addition,  the  QEF  election  remains  in  effect,  although  not
applicable, with respect to an Electing U.S. Holder even after such U.S. Holder disposes of all of his or its
direct and indirect interest in the shares of Rockwell. Therefore, if such U.S. Holder reacquires an interest
in Rockwell, that U.S. Holder will be subject to the rules described above for Electing U.S. Holders for
each tax year in which Rockwell qualifies as a PFIC.
In the case of a Non-Electing U.S. Holder, special taxation rules under Section 1291 of the Code will
apply to (i) gains realized on the disposition (or deemed to be realized by reasons of a pledge) of his
Rockwell  common  shares  and  (ii)  certain  "excess  distributions,"  as  defined  in  Section  1291(b),  by
Rockwell.
A Non-Electing U.S. Holder generally would be required to pro rate all gains realized on the disposition
of his Rockwell common shares and all excess distributions on his Rockwell common shares over the
entire holding period for the common shares. All gains or excess distributions allocated to prior years of
the  U.S.  Holder  (excluding  any  portion  of  the  holder's  period  prior  to  the  first  day  of  the  first  year  of
Rockwell (i) which began after December 31, 1986, and (ii) for which Rockwell was a PFIC) would be
taxed at the highest tax rate for each such prior year applicable to ordinary income. The Non-Electing
U.S.  Holder  also  would  be  liable  for  interest  on  the  foregoing  tax  liability  for  each  such  prior  year
calculated as if such liability had been due with respect to each such prior year. A Non-Electing U.S.
Holder that is not a corporation must treat this interest charge as "personal interest" which, as discussed
above, is wholly non-deductible. The balance, if any, of the gain or the excess distribution will be treated
as ordinary income in the year of the disposition or distribution, and no interest charge will be incurred
with respect to such balance. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the PFIC interest charge
may  exceed  the  amount  of  the  excess  distribution  received,  or  the  amount  of  proceeds  of  disposition
realized, by the U.S. Holder.
If  Rockwell  is  a  PFIC  for  any  taxable  year  during  which  a  Non-Electing  U.S.  Holder  holds  Rockwell
common  shares,  then  Rockwell  will  continue  to  be  treated  as  a  PFIC  with  respect  to  such  Rockwell
common shares, even if it is no longer definitionally a PFIC. A Non-Electing U.S. Holder may terminate
this deemed PFIC status by electing to recognize gain (which will be taxed under the rules discussed
above for Non-Electing U.S. Holders) as if such Rockwell common shares had been sold on the last day
of the last taxable year for which it was a PFIC.
Effective  for  tax  years  of  U.S.  Holders  beginning  after  December  31,  1997,  U.S.  Holders  who  hold
(actually or constructively) marketable stock of a foreign corporation that qualifies as a PFIC may elect to
mark such stock to the market annually (a "mark-to-market election"). If such an election is made, such
U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to the special taxation rules of Section 1291 discussed above.
However, if the mark-to-market election is made by a Non-Electing U.S. Holder after the beginning of the
holding  period  for  the  PFIC  stock,  then  the  Section  1291  rules  will  apply  to  certain  dispositions  of,
distributions on and other amounts taxable with respect to Rockwell common shares. A U.S. Holder who
makes the mark-to-market election will include in income for each taxable year for which the election is in
effect an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the common shares of Rockwell as
of the close of such tax year over such U.S. Holder's adjusted basis in such common shares. In addition,
the  U.S.  Holder  is  allowed  a  deduction  for  the  lesser  of  (i)  the  excess,  if  any,  of  such  U.S.  Holder's
adjusted tax basis in the common shares over the fair market value of such shares as of the close of the
tax year, or (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the mark-to-market gains for the common shares in Rockwell
included by such U.S. Holder for prior tax years, including any amount which would have been treated as
a mark-to-market gain for any prior tax year but for the Section 1291 rules discussed above with respect
to  Non-Electing  U.S.  Holders,  over  (B)  the  mark-to-market  losses  for  shares  that  were  allowed  as
deductions for prior tax years. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the common shares of Rockwell will
be adjusted to reflect the amount included in or deducted from income as a result of a mark-to-market
election. A mark-to-market election applies to the taxable year in which the election is made and to each
subsequent  taxable  year,  unless  Rockwell  common  shares  cease  to  be  marketable,  as  specifically
defined,  or  the  IRS  consents  to  revocation  of  the  election.  Because  the  IRS  has  not  established
procedures  for  making  a  mark-to-market  election,  U.S.  Holders  should  consult  their  tax  advisors
regarding  the  manner  of  making  such  an  election.  No  view  is  expressed  regarding  whether  common
shares of Rockwell are marketable for these purposes or whether the election will be available.
– Page 99 –
Under Section 1291(f) of the Code, the IRS has issued Proposed Treasury Regulations that, subject to
certain exceptions, would treat as taxable certain transfers of PFIC stock by Non-Electing U.S. Holders
that are generally not otherwise taxed, such as gifts, exchanges pursuant to corporate reorganizations,
and transfers at death. Generally, in such cases the basis of Rockwell common shares in the hands of the
transferee and the basis of any property received in the exchange for those common shares would be
increased by the amount of gain recognized. Under the Proposed Treasury Regulations, an Electing U.S.
Holder  would  not  be  taxed  on  certain  transfers  of  PFIC  stock,  such  as  gifts,  exchanges  pursuant  to
corporate reorganizations, and transfers at death. The transferee's basis in this case will depend on the
manner of the transfer. In the case of a transfer by an Electing U.S. Holder upon death, for example, the
transferee's basis is generally equal to the fair market value of the Electing U.S. Holder's common shares
as of the date of death under Section 1014 of the Code. The specific tax effect to the U.S. Holder and the
transferee may vary based on the manner in which the common shares are transferred. Each U.S. Holder
of  Rockwell  is  urged  to  consult  a  tax  advisor  with  respect  to  how  the  PFIC  rules  affect  his  or  its  tax
situation.
Whether or not a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to common shares of Rockwell,
certain adverse rules may apply in the event that both Rockwell and any foreign corporation in which
Rockwell directly or indirectly holds shares is a PFIC (a "lower-tier PFIC"). Pursuant to certain Proposed
Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder would be treated as owning his or its proportionate amount of any
lower-tier PFIC shares, and generally would be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to such indirectly-
held PFIC shares unless such U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect thereto. Rockwell
intends  to  make  the  necessary  information  available  to  U.S.  Holders  to  permit  them  to  make  (and
maintain) QEF elections with respect to each subsidiary of Rockwell that is a PFIC.
Under the Proposed Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder who does not make a timely QEF election with
respect to a lower-tier PFIC generally would be subject to tax (and the PFIC interest charge) on (i) any
excess distribution deemed to have been received with respect to his or its lower-tier PFIC shares and (ii)
any  gain  deemed  to  arise  from  a  so-called  "indirect  disposition"  of  such  shares.  For  this  purpose,  an
indirect disposition of lower-tier PFIC shares would generally include (i) a disposition by Rockwell (or an
intermediate entity) of lower-tier PFIC shares, and (ii) any other transaction resulting in a diminution of the
U.S.  Holder's  proportionate  ownership  of  the  lower-tier  PFIC,  including  an  issuance  of  additional
common  shares  by  Rockwell  (or  an  intermediate  entity).  Accordingly,  each  prospective  U.S.  Holder
should be aware that he or it could be subject to tax even if such U.S. Holder receives no distributions
from Rockwell and does not dispose of its common shares. Rockwell strongly urges each prospective
U.S.  Holder  to  consult  a  tax  advisor  with  respect  to  the  adverse  rules  applicable,  under  the
Proposed Treasury Regulations, to U.S. Holders of lower-tier PFIC shares.
– Page 100 –
Certain  special,  generally  adverse,  rules  will  apply  with  respect  to  Rockwell  common  shares  while
Rockwell is a PFIC unless the U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election. For example under Section
1298(b)(6) of the Code, a U.S. Holder who uses PFIC stock as security for a loan (including a margin
loan) will, except as may be provided in regulations, be treated as having made a taxable disposition of
such shares.
Controlled Foreign Corporation
If more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote or the total
value of the shares of Rockwell is owned, actually or constructively, by citizens or residents of the United
States, United States domestic partnerships or corporation, or estates or trusts other than foreign estates
or trusts (as defined by Code Section 7701(a)(31)), each of which own, actually or constructively, 10% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote of Rockwell ("United
States  Shareholder"),  Rockwell  could  be  treated  as  a  controlled  foreign  corporation  ("CFC")  under
Subpart  F  of  the  Code.  This  classification  would  effect  many  complex  results,  one  of  which  is  the
inclusion of certain income of a CFC which is subject to current U.S. tax. The United States generally
taxes United States Shareholders of a CFC currently on their pro rata shares of the Subpart F income of
the CFC. Such United States Shareholders are generally treated as having received a current distribution
out of the CFC's Subpart F income and are also subject to current U.S. tax on their pro rata shares of
increases in the CFC's earnings invested in U.S. property. The foreign tax credit described above may
reduce the U.S. tax on these amounts. In addition, under Section 1248 of the Code, gain from the sale or
exchange of shares by a U.S. Holder of common shares of Rockwell which is or was a United States
Shareholder at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange is treated
as ordinary income to the extent of earnings and profits of Rockwell attributable to the shares sold or
exchanged. If a foreign corporation is both a PFIC and a CFC, the foreign corporation generally will not
be treated as a PFIC with respect to United States Shareholders of the CFC. This rule generally will be
effective for taxable years of United States Shareholders beginning after 1997 and for taxable years of
foreign  corporations  ending  with  or  within  such  taxable  years  of  United  States  Shareholders.  Special
rules apply to United States Shareholders who are subject to the special taxation rules under Section
1291 discussed above with respect to a PFIC. Because of the complexity of Subpart F, a more detailed
review of these rules is outside of the scope of this discussion. Rockwell does not believe that it currently
qualifies as a CFC. However, there can be no assurance that Rockwell will not be considered a CFC for
the current or any future taxable year.

ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
(a) Transaction Risk and Currency Risk Management
The Company's operations do not employ financial instruments or derivatives that are market sensitive
and the Company does not have financial market risks.
(b) Exchange Rate Sensitivity
In the normal course of business for its diamond operations, the Company enters into transactions for the
purchase  of  supplies  and  services  denominated  in  South  African  rand.  As  a  result,  the  Company  is
subject  to  foreign  exchange  risk  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates.  The  Company  has  not
entered into any derivative or other financial instruments to mitigate this foreign exchange risk.
(c) Interest Rate Risk and Equity Price Risk
The Company is equity financed and does not have any debt which would be subject to interest rate
change risks.
(d) Commodity Price Risk
While  the  value  of  the  Company's  mineral  properties  can  always  be  said  to  relate  to  the  price  of  the
commodity and the outlook for same, the Company does not have any hedging or other commodity based
risks respecting its operations.
(e) Exchange Controls
The  Company  operates  in  South  Africa,  and  like  other  foreign  entities  operating  there,  is  subject  to
currency exchange controls administered by the South African Reserve Bank, the country's central bank.
A  significant  portion  of  the  Company's  funding  structure  for  its  South  African  operations  consists  of
advancing loans to its subsidiaries incorporated in South Africa. The Company's ability to repatriate such
funds once those subsidiaries are able to repay the loans, or to repatriate other funds such as operating
profits should any develop, may be adversely affected by such exchange controls.

ITEM 15. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
A. Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive
Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  evaluated  our  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report on Form 20-F. Based on this evaluation, these officers concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 20-F, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective  to  ensure  that  the  information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  our  Company  in  reports  it  files  or
submits  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our company’s management, including our company’s
principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required
disclosure. The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective was due to the
presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as identified below under the
heading “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.”
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected.
B. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over  financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f)  of  the  Exchange  Act)  for  our
company.  Our  company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  designed  to  provide  reasonable
assurance, not absolute assurance, regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
Canada.
Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and  procedures  that:  (i)  pertain  to  the
maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and
dispositions of our company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles in Canada, and that our company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only
in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  our  management  and  directors;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable
assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or  disposition  of
assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
– Page 105 –
Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect
misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  conducted  an
evaluation of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 28,
2009 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  This  evaluation  included  review  of  the
documentation  of  controls,  evaluation  of  the  design  effectiveness  of  controls,  testing  of  the  operating
effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our management
concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as at February 28, 2009 due to
resulting  material  weaknesses  from  the  aggregation  of  the  following  significant  deficiencies:  (i)
insufficient supervision and review by key accounting personnel over routine, non-routine and complex
accounting  transactions;  (ii)  inconsistent  application  of  documented  financial  reporting  procedures  by
accounting  personnel;  and  (iii)  ineffective  review  of  certain  accounting  transactions  by  accounting
personnel.
In order to remediate the material weaknesses, the Company’s management continues to enhance the
effectiveness  of  internal  controls  related  to  its  financial  reporting  process,  including  improvements  to
remediate the internal control deficiencies that existed as at February 28, 2009. Management has the
following remediation plans in progress: (i) enhance controls around the timing and level of review of
accounting schedules and calculations that support significant financial statement accounts; (ii) reinforce
to  accounting  personnel  the  importance  of  consistent  application  of  accounting  procedures;  and  (iii)
provide  appropriate  training  to  accounting  personnel  regarding  the  Company’s  period  end  financial
reporting process and procedures.
These programs, as enhanced, are designed to reduce, although they may not eliminate, the risk of a
material misstatement to a reasonable level. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent
upon  our  Company  securing  additional  financing  to  cover  the  costs  of  implementing  the  changes
required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in
a material manner.
Our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to
provide only management’s report in this annual report.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance  that  all  control  issues,  if  any,  within  our  company  have  been  detected.  These  inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can
occur because of simple error or mistake.
C. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
– Page 106 –
There were changes in internal control over financial reporting in the year ended February 28, 2009 that
have  materially  affected  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  internal  control  over  financial
reporting.  However,  as  a  result  of  the  evaluation  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of
February 28, 2009, conducted by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we expect to
continue making such changes in response to the remediation plan.

ITEM 16. AUDIT COMMITTEE, CODE OF ETHICS, ACCOUNTANT FEES AND EXEMPTIONS
A. Audit Committee Financial Expert
A  member  of  the  audit  committee  is  independent  if  the  member  has  no  direct  or  indirect  material
relationship with the Company. A material relationship means a relationship which could, in the view of
the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  reasonably  interfere  with  the  exercise  of  a  member’s  independent
judgment.
A member of the audit committee is considered financially literate if he or she has the ability to read and
understand  a  set  of  financial  statements  that  present  a  breadth  and  level  of  complexity  of  accounting
issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues that can reasonably be
expected to be raised by the Company.
B. Code of Ethics
Rockwell  has  adopted  a  code  of  ethics  that  applies  to  Rockwell's  chief  executive  officer,  the  chief
financial  officer,  and  other  members  of  senior  management,  which  can  be  viewed  at  the  Company’s
website www.rockwelldiamonds.com.
C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services

Note:(1) "Audit-Related Fees" include services that are traditionally performed by the auditor. These
audit-related services include employee benefit audits, due diligence assistance, accounting
consultations on proposed transactions, internal control reviews and audit or attest services not
required by legislation or regulation.
 
(2) The audit for the nine-months ended February 29, 2008 was performed by Davidson and
Company, Chartered Accountants.
Management  of  the  Company  requests  approval  from  the  audit  committee  for  all  audit  and  non-audit
services to be provided by the Company's auditors. The audit committee pre-approves all such services
with  set  maximum  dollar  amounts  for  each  itemized  service.  During  such  deliberations,  the  audit
committee  assesses,  among  other  factors,  whether  the  services  requested  would  be  considered
"prohibited services" as contemplated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and whether the
services requested and the fees related to such services could impair the independence of the auditors.
