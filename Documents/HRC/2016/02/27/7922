</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers examines the relevance and analyses the possibilities of providing legal aid to 
individuals who come into contact with the law but cannot afford the costs of legal advice, 
counsel and representation. The main goal of the report is to encourage States to develop 
and implement effective and sustainable legal aid schemes to enable individuals to exercise 
and enjoy a number of human rights, including the rights to a fair trial and to an effective 
remedy. The Special Rapporteur considers that legal aid should be ensured both in criminal 
and in non-criminal cases, and encompass all stages of judicial or extrajudicial procedures, 
thus contributing to the elimination of obstacles that hamper access to justice through the 
provision of assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal counsel, representation 
and access to the court system. 
</p>
<p>Following a brief outline of the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur in 
2012, the thematic section of the present report consists of three parts. The first highlights 
existing international human rights standards relating to legal aid; the second focuses on the 
normative content of the right to legal aid, and reviews the jurisprudence of human rights 
treaty bodies and regional courts on this issue; while the third contains an analysis of the 
legislative, judicial, administrative, budgetary, educative and other measures that States are 
required to take in order to give effect to the right to legal aid in their domestic order. The 
final section contains conclusions and a number of recommendations aimed at assisting 
States and other stakeholders in adopting and implementing appropriate and effective 
measures to strengthen access to legal aid in their systems of administration of justice.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 17/2.  
</p>
<p>2. Following a brief outline of the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers in 2012, the thematic section of the present report 
focuses on legal aid. It consists of three parts: the first part highlights existing international 
human rights standards relating to legal aid; the second part focuses on the normative 
content of the right to legal aid, and reviews the jurisprudence of human rights treaty bodies 
and regional courts on this issue; while the third part contains an analysis of the legislative, 
judicial, administrative, budgetary, educative and other measures that States are required to 
take in order to give effect to the right to legal aid in their domestic order.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur notes that an independent judiciary should guarantee an 
efficient and effective administration of justice for all, without discrimination of any kind, 
such as on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, in order to protect and enforce 
human rights equally. Legal aid is an essential component of a fair and efficient justice 
system that is founded on the rule of law and, as such, it represents an important safeguard 
that contributes to ensuring the fairness and public trust in the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>4. Despite the above, the implementation of legal aid systems remains a challenge for 
many States, either because the definition of legal aid and the established eligibility criteria 
pose excessive restrictions on the kinds of service available or because States lack expertise 
and financial resources to implement effective schemes.  
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur addresses these challenges and 
proposes a number of solutions, encouraging States to establish effective and sustainable 
legal aid systems aimed at guaranteeing the exercise and enjoyment of a number of human 
rights, including the rights to a fair trial and to an effective remedy. The analysis, 
conclusions and recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur are based on 
international human rights standards, which, together with national legislation, may provide 
adequate guidance on how to face the challenges relating to legal aid and ensure that all 
have access to it.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities in 2012 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Country visits and communications with Member States

<p><b> III. Legal aid 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>20. Legal aid is an essential component of a fair and efficient justice system founded on 
the rule of law. It is also a right in itself and an essential precondition for the exercise and 
enjoyment of a number of human rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to an 
effective remedy. Access to legal advice and assistance is also an important safeguard that 
helps to ensure fairness and public trust in the administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>21. Several international and regional human rights treaties recognize access to free 
legal assistance as an essential component of the right to a fair trial. Article 14 (3) (d) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights lists, among the procedural guarantees 
available to persons charged with a criminal offence, the right &#8220;to defend himself in person 
</p>
<p>or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal 
assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the 
interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not 
have sufficient means to pay for it.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>22. Article 18 (3)(d) of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families includes a formulation that is almost 
identical to that included in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes that children deprived of their liberty and 
those alleged as, accused of or recognized as having infringed criminal law have the right to 
have access to &#8220;legal and other appropriate assistance&#8221; (arts. 37 (d) and 40 (2)(b)(ii) and 
</p>
<p>(iii)), but does not contain any express reference to free legal assistance. In its general 
comment No. 10, however, the Committee on the Rights of the Child stressed that this 
assistance should be free of charge.1 
</p>
<p>23. Among regional instruments, the right to free legal assistance is recognized in both 
the European and Inter-American systems. Article 6 (3)(c) of the European Convention on 
Human Rights includes the right of the accused to be given free legal assistance when that 
person does not have sufficient means to pay for it and the interests of justice so require in 
the list of &#8220;minimum rights&#8221; of defendants in criminal proceedings. Article 8 (2)(e) of the 
</p>
<p>American Convention on Human Rights qualifies the right to be assisted by counsel 
provided by the State as an &#8220;inalienable right&#8221; but, unlike the United Nations and the 
</p>
<p>European texts, it does not include any reference to the interests of justice or the financial 
situation of the defendant. 
</p>
<p>24. The right to free legal assistance has been proclaimed in a large number of United 
Nations legal instruments, including the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners,2 the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of 
Detention or Imprisonment,3 the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers,4 the Rules for the 
Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (&#8220;the Havana Rules&#8221;)5 and the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (&#8220;the Beijing Rules&#8221;).6

</p>

 5 General Assembly resolution 45/113, annex, para. 18(<i>a</i>). 
 6 General Assembly resolution 40/33, rule 15.1. </p>


<p>25. In December 2012, the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Principles and 
Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems,7 which aim &#8220;to provide 
guidance to States on the fundamental principles on which a legal aid system in criminal 
justice should be based and to outline the specific elements required for an effective and 
sustainable national legal aid system&#8221;. Although the Principles and Guidelines only focus 
</p>
<p>on the provision of legal aid in the criminal justice system, the Special Rapporteur 
considers that they represent the most comprehensive legal instrument to date for the 
development and strengthening of legal aid systems at the national level.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>26. Existing human rights treaties do not provide any definition of legal aid. The only 
internationally agreed definition is that contained in the United Nations Principles and 
Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, which construes the term 
&#8220;legal aid&#8221; as including &#8220;legal advice, assistance and representation for victims and for 
arrested, prosecuted and detained persons in the criminal justice process, provided free of 
charge for those without means. Furthermore, &#8222;legal aid&#8223; is intended to include the concepts 
of legal education, access to legal information and other services provided for persons 
through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and restorative justice processes&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur considers that the aim of legal aid is to contribute to the 
elimination of obstacles and barriers that impair or restrict access to justice by providing 
assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal representation and access to the court 
system. Accordingly, the definition of legal aid should be as broad as possible. It should 
include not only the right to free legal assistance in criminal proceedings, as defined in 
article 14 (3) (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but also the 
provision of effective legal assistance in any judicial or extrajudicial procedure aimed at 
determining rights and obligations. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the right to legal aid can be construed as 
both a right and an essential procedural guarantee for the effective exercise of other human 
rights, including the right to an effective remedy, the right to liberty and security of person, 
the right to equality before the courts and tribunals, the right to counsel and the right to a 
fair trial. Owing to its importance and considering its potential scope, the right to legal aid 
should be recognized, guaranteed and promoted in both criminal and non-criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>29. In its general comment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee acknowledged 
that &#8220;the availability or absence of legal assistance often determines whether or not a person 
can access the relevant proceedings or participate in them in a meaningful way&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>encouraged States to provide free legal aid not only in criminal proceedings, but also in 
other cases where individuals do not have sufficient means to pay for it. In some cases, the 
Committee considered that States may even be obliged to do so, for instance &#8220;where a 
</p>
<p>person sentenced to death seeks available constitutional review of irregularities in a 
criminal trial but does not have sufficient means to meet the cost of legal assistance to 
pursue such a remedy&#8221; (para. 10). 
</p>
<p>30. In its general comment No. 28 (2000), the Human Rights Committee requested 
States parties to provide information on whether access to justice and the right to a fair trial, 
provided for in article 14 of the Covenant, were enjoyed by women on equal terms with 
</p>
<p>  
 7 General Assembly resolution 67/187, annex.  
 8 Ibid., para. 8. </p>


<p>men, and whether measures had been taken to ensure that women had &#8220;equal access to legal 
</p>
<p>aid, in particular in family matters&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p>31. Other human rights treaty bodies have also mentioned the right to have access to 
legal aid in their general comments or general recommendations. In its general comment 
No. 7 (1997), the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights included legal aid in 
the list of procedural guarantees that should be provided to persons who have been subject 
to forced eviction and seek redress from the courts.10  
</p>
<p>32. In its general recommendation XXXI (2005), the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination recommended that States parties to the Convention should (a) supply 
legal information to persons belonging to the most vulnerable social groups, who are often 
unaware of their rights; (b) promote, in the areas where such persons live, institutions such 
as free legal help and advice centres, legal information centres and centres for conciliation 
and mediation; and (c) expand their cooperation with associations of lawyers, university 
institutions, legal advice centres and non-governmental organizations specializing in 
protecting the rights of marginalized communities and in the prevention of discrimination.11 
In its general recommendation XXIX (2002), the Committee also recommended that States 
take the necessary steps to secure equal access to the justice system for all members of 
descent-based communities, &#8220;including by providing legal aid, facilitating of group claims 
and encouraging non-governmental organizations to defend community rights&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>33. In its general comment No. 3 (2012), the Committee against Torture stated that 
States parties should provide adequate legal aid to those victims of torture or ill-treatment 
lacking the necessary resources to bring complaints and to make claims for redress, and that 
the failure to provide sufficient legal aid and protection measures for victims and witnesses 
impede the enjoyment of the right to redress and prevent effective implementation of article 
14.13 
</p>
<p>34. In its general comment No. 1 (2011) on domestic migrant workers, the Committee 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
encouraged embassies and consulates of countries of origin present in countries where 
migrant domestic workers are employed to ensure, in coordination with the authorities in 
the countries of employment, adequately trained staff and mechanisms, including telephone 
hotlines, to receive and address complaints made by migrant domestic workers, including 
through the provision of legal aid.14 
</p>
<p>35. In accordance with the jurisprudence of existing human rights treaty bodies, the 
Special Rapporteur considers that the notion of beneficiaries of legal aid should be 
extended to any person who comes into contact with the law and does not have the means 
to pay for counsel. This concept also includes (a) any person whose rights or freedoms have 
been violated as a result of an act, or a failure to act, perpetrated by a State actor, and (b) 
any person who participates in judicial or extrajudicial procedures aimed at determining 
rights and obligations &#8220;in a suit at law&#8221;.

 14 CMW/C/GC/1, para. 62. </p>


<p>36. In the first case, the obligation to provide legal aid to those who lack sufficient 
financial means to pay for these services stems from article 8 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and article 2, subparagraphs 3 (a) and (b) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, which recognize the right to an effective remedy by the 
competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights set out in 
international treaties, the Constitution or the law.  
</p>
<p>37. In the latter case, the obligation derives from article 14, paragraph 1 of the 
International Covenant, which recognizes the right to a fair trial in cases regarding the 
determination of the rights and obligations of individuals in a suit at law. In its general 
comment No. 32 (2007), the Human Rights Committee noted that the concept of &#8220;suit at 
law&#8221; was based on the nature of the rights in question rather than on the status of one of the 
</p>
<p>parties or the particular forum provided by domestic legal systems for the determination of 
particular rights.15 The concept encompasses (a) judicial procedures aimed at determining 
rights and obligations pertaining to the areas of contract, property and torts in the area of 
private law, and (b) equivalent notions in the area of administrative law, such as the 
termination of employment of civil servants or the determination of their social security 
benefits.  
</p>
<p>38. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights has adopted a similar 
position. Although article 6 of the European Convention does not expressly require States 
to provide free legal assistance in civil matters, the Court found such an obligation in article 
6, paragraph 1, in its guarantee of access to the courts, holding that &#8220;indigent applicants are 
</p>
<p>entitled to free counsel when such assistance is indispensable for effective access to the 
courts and a fair hearing&#8221;. In <i>Airey v. Ireland</i>, the Court found a violation of article 6 (1) 
where the applicant was unable to obtain a judicial separation from her husband without 
legal assistance. The Court found that she had effectively been denied access to the courts, 
highlighting the complexity of the proceedings and the fact that marital disputes often entail 
emotional involvement that is scarcely compatible with the degree of objectivity required 
for advocacy in court.  
</p>
<p>39. The right to legal aid is subject to two conditions. First, the beneficiary must lack 
&#8220;sufficient means&#8221; to pay for legal aid services. Existing human rights treaties contain no 
</p>
<p>definition of &#8220;sufficient means&#8221;, and there is no case law indicating the level or kind of 
private means that may be taken into account when deciding whether to award legal aid.16 
Second, in criminal proceedings, legal aid should be provided &#8220;where the interests of justice 
</p>
<p>so require&#8221;. The interests of justice take into consideration a number of factors, such as 
what is at stake for the applicant in terms of the seriousness of the offence and hence the 
possible sentence that could result from it. In cases involving capital punishment, the 
Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively 
assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings&#8221;.17 The more complicated the case is on 
the law or the facts, the more likely that legal aid is required, although due regard must be 
given to the capacity of the accused to defend himself.  
</p>
<p>40. Counsel provided by the competent authorities must be effective in the 
representation of the beneficiary of legal aid. As the Human Rights Committee pointed out, 
&#8220;blatant misbehaviour or incompetence, for example the withdrawal of an appeal without 
consultation in a death penalty case, or absence during the hearing of a witness in such 
cases may entail the responsibility of the State concerned for a violation of article 14, 
</p>
<p>  
 15 CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 16. 
 16 David Harris, Michael O&#8223;Boyle and Colin Warbrick, <i>Law of the European Convention on Human 
</i></p>
<p><i>Rights</i>, second edition (New York, Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 317. 
 17 CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38. </p>


<p>paragraph 3 (d)&#8221;.18 In <i>Artico v. Italy</i>, the European Court of Human Rights found that the 
right to free legal assistance in article 6, paragraph 3 (c) was not satisfied simply by the 
formal appointment of a lawyer; rather, it required that legal assistance be effective. The 
State must take &#8220;positive action&#8221; to ensure that the applicant effectively enjoys his or her 
</p>
<p>right to free legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>41. Effective legal aid should be provided promptly and continuously at all stages of 
judicial or extrajudicial proceedings. Effective legal aid includes, but is not limited to, 
unhindered access to legal aid providers, confidentiality of communications, access to 
information and to case files, and adequate time and facilities to prepare legal cases, as well 
as the provision of legal advice and education, and mechanisms for alternative dispute 
resolution. Persons who are deprived of their liberty should be informed, prior to any 
questioning, of their right to legal aid and of other procedural safeguards.19 In <i>S v 
Switzerland</i>, for example, the European Court of Human Rights found that article 6, 
paragraph 3 (c) was infringed when the accused, who was in detention on remand, was not 
allowed to consult his lawyer out of the hearing of a prison officer. 
</p>
<p>42. The effectiveness of legal aid should be further ensured through the 
institutionalization of services so that their provision may be evaluated, organized and 
monitored. The providers of legal aid should, moreover, be held accountable for the 
services they offer as a means to ensure the quality of legal advice, counsel and 
representation, and proper and adequate access to the court system.  
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>States&#8217; obligations<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General legal obligations 
</b></p>
<p>43. According to international human rights law, the State bears the primary 
responsibility to adopt all appropriate legislative, judicial, administrative, budgetary, 
educative and other measures towards the full realization of the right to legal aid for any 
individual within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction who does not have sufficient 
financial means to pay for legal aid or to meet the costs associated with judicial 
proceedings. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that access to legal aid must be 
available to all individuals, regardless of nationality or statelessness, including asylum 
seekers, refugees, migrant workers and other persons, who may find themselves in the 
territory or subject to the jurisdiction of the State party.20 
</p>
<p>44. States have an obligation to take the steps necessary to give effect to the right to 
legal aid in their domestic order. If this right is not already guaranteed by national 
legislation or practices, States are required to make such changes to their legislation and 
practices as necessary to ensure their conformity with the international legal obligations 
that they have undertaken. Where there are inconsistencies between domestic law and 
international obligations stemming from an international human rights treaty to which they 
are a party, domestic law or practice should be changed to meet those human rights 
standards.

<p>to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the 
fundamental rights granted by the Constitution or by law. With regard to legal aid, 
according to principle 9 of the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal 
Aid in Criminal Justice Systems (see paragraph 25 above), States have an obligation to 
establish effective remedies if access to legal aid is undermined, delayed or denied or if 
persons have not been adequately informed of their right to legal aid. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Specific legal obligations 
</b></p>
<p>46. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur noted that access to justice requires the 
establishment of a judicial system that guarantees rights and of parallel measures, such as 
mechanisms and programmes to facilitate free legal assistance, in both criminal and civil 
cases.21 Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur noted that, in practice, many countries still 
lack the resources and capacity necessary to promote the right of everyone to free legal aid, 
and that the inadequacy of funds to ensure legal support for those who do not have 
sufficient financial means adversely affects their access to justice and, consequently, their 
equal and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>47. At the individual level, court proceedings may represent a heavy financial burden. 
Costs include initiating and pursuing legal proceedings, lawyers&#8223; fees and other costs such 
as travel and loss of working time as a result of a court case. These costs have 
proportionally greater effects on low-income sectors, and the impossibility of paying for 
legal aid or of meeting the costs associated with a court case has been regarded as 
constituting a form of discrimination in cases where a person&#8223;s financial situation places 
</p>
<p>him or her in a position of inequality before the law.22 
</p>
<p>48. In order to implement the right to legal aid at the domestic level, States are required 
to develop and implement an effective and sustainable legal aid system that draws from 
international human rights standards and recognized good practices. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid 
in Criminal Justice Systems provide guidance on the fundamental principles on which legal 
aid systems should be based, and outline the specific elements required to strengthen access 
to legal aid for those without the necessary financial resources. Although the Principles and 
Guidelines only refer to legal assistance in criminal proceedings, the Special Rapporteur is 
of the view that they may also be applied, mutatis mutandis, in civil and administrative law 
cases where free legal assistance is indispensable for effective access to the courts and a fair 
hearing, as well as for access to legal information and counsel and to mechanisms of 
alternative dispute resolution.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Establishment of a national legal aid system 
</i></p>
<p>49. The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal 
Justice Systems list the following models for the provision of legal aid: public defenders, 
private lawyers, contract lawyers, pro bono schemes, bar associations, paralegals, and 
others. They also note that States include a wide range of stakeholders as legal aid service 
providers, including non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, 
religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and associations, 
and academia.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that it is up to the individual State to identify 
the legal aid model that can maximize access to free legal aid for all individuals within its 
</p>
<p>  
 21 A/HRC/8/4, para. 23. 
 22 Ibid., para. 25. </p>


<p>territory and subject to its jurisdiction, taking into account the scope and funding of legal 
aid schemes, the type of justice systems they belong to, and the area of jurisdiction where 
they function. Nevertheless, she also wishes to emphasize that, regardless of the structure of 
the legal aid programme or its formal status, it is of paramount importance that legal aid 
schemes be autonomous and independent in order to ensure that they serve the interests of 
those who need financial support to have access to justice on an equal basis with others.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Legislation 
</i></p>
<p>51. Since access to legal aid constitutes an essential procedural guarantee for the 
effective exercise of a number of human rights, the right to legal aid must be legally 
guaranteed in national legal systems at the highest possible level, possibly in the 
Constitution.23 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that some 
States have already incorporated this right into their constitutional charters,24 whereas some 
constitutional courts or other judicial authorities have considered this right an implicit yet 
essential precondition for the effective exercise of the right to a fair trial set out in the 
Constitution.25 
</p>
<p>52. A number of States protect the right to legal aid through the enactment of legal aid 
bills at the statutory level. While variations exist in the definition, scope and delivery terms 
of legal aid services, in a number of countries, domestic legislation provides for legal aid 
beyond cases of mandatory defence to all indigent persons when the interests of justice so 
require. Such domestic legal aid provisions render legal aid available not only in court 
proceedings, but also throughout the procedural stages of a case and in extrajudicial 
proceedings.26 
</p>
<p>53. States that have not already enacted specific legislation to establish a comprehensive 
legal aid system that is accessible, effective, sustainable and credible should consider doing 
so. Legislation on legal aid should ensure that effective legal assistance is provided at all 
stages of the justice process, at the pretrial stage, as well as in any judicial or extrajudicial 
procedure aimed at determining rights and obligations, provided that the person does not 
have sufficient means to pay for legal aid and, in criminal cases, that the interest of justice 
so require. In particular, legislation should ensure that effective legal aid is provided to 
victims of human rights violations in order to ensure that they have access to an effective 
remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights set out 
in international treaties, the Constitution or the law. 
</p>
<p>54. National legislation should also include specific criteria to determine eligibility for 
legal aid, particularly with regard to the limits of the financial means that trigger eligibility. 
Moreover, persons who are denied legal aid on the basis of the criteria set out in national 
</p>
<p>  
 23 United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, 
</p>
<p>principle 1. 
 24 See for example article 39 A of the Constitution of India: &#8220;The State shall (&#8230;) provide free legal aid 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of 
economic or other disabilities&#8221;; article 294 (I) of the Constitution of Ghana: &#8220;A person is entitled to 
legal aid in connection with any proceedings relatively to this Constitution if he has reasonable 
grounds for taking, defending, prosecuting or being a party to the proceedings&#8221;; and article 18 (1) of 
the Constitution of the Netherlands: &#8220;Everyone may be legally represented in legal and administrative 
</p>
<p>proceedings.&#8221; 
 25 See for example David McQuoid Mason, &#8220;South African legal aid in non-criminal cases, in <i>Making 
</i></p>
<p><i>legal aid a reality: a resource book for policy makers and civil society</i> (Budapest, Public Interest Law 
Institute, 2010).  
</p>
<p> 26 See for example the 1969 Legal Aid Act of South Africa, the 1999 Access to Justice Act of England 
and Wales, the 2005 New Legal Aid Law of Lithuania, and the 2009 Legal Aid Bill of Sierra Leone. </p>


<p>legislation should have the right to appeal the decision.27 In criminal cases, for instance, 
persons urgently requiring legal aid, such as those held at police stations or detention 
centres, should be provided preliminary legal aid while their eligibility is being determined. 
While the onus is on the accused to show that he or she lacks sufficient means, he or she 
need not, however, do so &#8220;beyond all doubt&#8221;; it is sufficient that there are &#8220;some 
indications&#8221; that this is so.28 It is up to the court, with due regard for the particular 
circumstances of the case and the situation of the accused, to determine whether the person 
should be provided with legal aid and whether it is in the interests of justice that this aid be 
provided.29 In civil cases, establishing substantive eligibility criteria is usually more 
complex. The elements considered when legal aid is to be provided in these cases are often 
based on financial criteria and on an evaluation of costs and benefits, which may 
demonstrate the likelihood of success on the basis of the merits and the potential gain or 
loss to the client.30  
</p>
<p>55. While it is necessary to set out financial guidelines in order to avoid diluting the 
capacity of legal aid programmes, it is important that, when means testing criteria are put in 
place, they be accurate and take into account the distribution of wealth in the household, so 
as not to disadvantage those who have restricted access to household wealth, such as 
women and older persons. In addition to financial eligibility criteria, many legal aid 
programmes also impose substantive eligibility criteria. When such merit tests condition the 
delivery of legal aid, they should not be so restrictive that they deprive individuals of their 
right to legal assistance, even if the case is weak. Substantive eligibility criteria in civil 
legal aid programmes are generally based on the likelihood of success of the case, and can 
help to channel resources effectively. In any case, persons who are denied legal aid on the 
basis of the criteria set out in national legislation should have the right to appeal the 
decision of the court. 
</p>
<p>56. The quality of legal aid depends in primis on the qualifications and training of legal 
aid providers. In this regard, national legislation on legal aid should ensure that 
professionals working for the legal aid system possess the qualifications and training 
appropriate for the services they provide.31 Where there is a shortage of qualified lawyers, 
the provision of legal aid services may also include non-lawyers or paralegals. In such 
cases, national legislation should ensure that minimum quality standards for paralegal 
services are met and that paralegals receive appropriate training opportunities and operate 
under the supervision of a qualified lawyer. Legislation should also specify the types of 
legal services that may be provided by paralegals and those that can only be provided by 
qualified legal professionals.

<p><i> (c) Information on legal aid 
</i></p>
<p>57. Information on the right to legal aid and in what such aid consists, including the 
availability of legal aid services and how to gain access to them, constitutes an essential 
precondition for the effective exercise of this right. Such information should be made 
available to the general public through all appropriate means, including the media and the 
Internet, and should be accessible in any facility where persons are imprisoned or detained 
(such as in police stations, detention centres or prisons). Furthermore, police officers, 
prosecutors, lawyers and judges should inform unrepresented persons of their right to legal 
aid and other procedural safeguards. Foreign detainees and prisoners should be informed, in 
a language they understand, of their right to request contact with their consular authorities 
without delay.32  
</p>
<p><i> (d) National legal aid system: different options 
</i></p>
<p>58. The structure of legal aid models varies greatly, depending on their scope and 
funding, the type of justice systems they belong to and the area of jurisdiction where they 
function. Some of the most common models for the provision of legal aid are public 
defenders, private lawyers, contract lawyers, pro bono schemes, bar associations and 
paralegals. Although States have the primary obligation to provide legal aid services, a 
wide range of stakeholders may contribute to providing legal aid to those lacking the 
necessary financial means.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that it is up to the individual State to identify 
the legal aid model that can maximize access to free legal aid for all individuals within its 
territory and subject to its jurisdiction, taking into account the specific characteristics of its 
justice system.  
</p>
<p>60. States employ different models for the provision of legal aid to those lacking the 
necessary financial resources. These models include the ones set out below. 
</p>
<p> (i) State-run legal aid programmes 
</p>
<p>61. In some cases, legal aid programmes are established and administered solely by the 
State, constituting an exclusively public service. Legal aid is provided by independent and 
autonomous legal aid agencies or authorities that provide, administer, coordinate and 
monitor legal aid services. Under these schemes, lawyers operate as if they were civil 
servants paid by the State to provide free legal assistance.  
</p>
<p>62. State-run legal aid schemes, regardless of their administrative structure, should be 
free from undue political or judicial interference and be independent of Government in 
decision-making related to legal aid. They should also have the powers necessary to 
provide legal aid in, for example, the appointment of personnel and setting the criteria and 
accreditation of legal aid providers, and should develop, in consultation with key justice 
sector stakeholders and civil society organizations, a long-term strategy on legal aid.  
</p>
<p>63. Some States, particularly in Latin America, have established public defender&#8223;s 
offices either as State institutions (namely, as part of the judiciary or the Ministry of 
Justice) or as functionally and financially autonomous entities. Whatever its organization 
and structure, public defenders&#8223; programmes should be autonomous and independent of the 
judiciary, the prosecutor&#8223;s office and executive power. The Special Rapporteur considers 
that this kind of programme often constitutes one of the most effective ways of delivering 
legal aid, since public defenders have financial incentives to provide adequate, continuous 
</p>
<p>  
 32 Ibid., guideline 2. </p>


<p>and effective legal aid to those who cannot afford a lawyer and to other disadvantaged 
persons. 
</p>
<p> (ii) Partnerships with non-State legal aid service providers 
</p>
<p>64. Other legal aid schemes are based on a public-private partnership with bar 
associations, non-governmental or community-based organizations, faith-based groups or 
the academia, to mention but a few. States may encourage the establishment of centres to 
provide legal aid services that are staffed by lawyers and paralegals or enter into 
agreements with law societies and bar associations, university law clinics and non-
governmental or other organizations to provide legal aid services. Under these public-
private partnerships, States must set quality standards for legal aid services, support the 
development of standardized training programmes for non-State legal aid service providers 
and establish monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure the quality of legal aid 
services. Some States also have a mixed legal aid system combining different models.33 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur encourages States to recognize and support the contribution 
of non-State actors in providing legal aid, and recommends that they adopt all appropriate 
measures to ensure that non-State legal aid providers are able to carry out their work 
effectively, freely, autonomously and independently, and without any intimidation, 
harassment or improper interference. 
</p>
<p>66. In some cases, legal aid is provided by private lawyers or bar associations, which are 
later reimbursed by the State for the services provided. In some countries, this scheme is 
referred to as the &#8220;judicare&#8221; system.34 In these schemes, judges or administrative bodies 
assign a case on an ad hoc basis to a private lawyer, who is paid per hour of work and is 
often subject to restrictions on the number of cases allocated to him or her. The 
disadvantages of this approach include favouritism and corruption during the appointment 
of counsel, and the lack of monitoring and continuity of legal assistance of the services 
provided. Bar associations may also help to enhance the reach of legal aid services. They 
can help to create legal assistance telephone hotlines for inquiries and advice, support 
lawyers&#8223; pro bono activities and provide information and education tools on legal issues to 
the general public. 
</p>
<p>67. In other cases, legal aid is provided by pro bono lawyers, either on a volunteer or 
compulsory basis. In the first case, bar associations may encourage members of the legal 
profession to provide pro bono legal aid services. In the second case, a mandatory pro bono 
requirement may be imposed on lawyers by the bar association, a licencing agency or the 
Government. Mandatory requirements to provide legal aid often result in low-quality 
services, since members of the legal profession do not have any financial incentive to act on 
the cases compulsorily assigned to them.  
</p>
<p>68. Another problem associated with pro bono legal aid is the lack of appropriate 
mechanisms to monitor the quality of the services provided. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to recall that international human rights standards require that free legal 
aid be &#8220;effective&#8221; and sustainable (see paragraph 40 above). A lawyer, even though 
appointed by the State, is not an &#8220;organ&#8221; of the State who can engage its direct 
responsibility by his or her action, while the State cannot be held responsible for every 
</p>
<p>  
 33 For example, in the Netherlands, the legal aid system relies on both a network of publicly funded 
</p>
<p>legal aid centres, which employ salaried staff lawyers who provide legal services to clients, and on 
private lawyers, who are paid by the State to provide services directly to qualifying low-income 
clients. 
</p>
<p> 34 See for example the legal aid system in the United States of America, where civil legal aid is 
generally provided by private attorneys who are reimbursed by the State. </p>


<p>shortcoming of a lawyer acting for the defence. Nevertheless, lawyers must be responsible 
for the services they provide, as they must guide their actions according to the codes of 
ethics or conduct relating to the legal profession. Hence, once lawyers offer their services, 
either voluntarily or compulsorily, they must be held accountable for their professional 
conduct and actions. 
</p>
<p>69. Another model of legal aid scheme consists in the establishment of legal aid clinics 
in the law department of a university. Under such schemes, students provide free legal 
assistance, help in the preparation of cases and represent clients in court proceedings, 
usually under the supervision of a qualified lawyer or faculty staff member. With regard to 
legal aid clinics, States should take appropriate measures to encourage the support and 
establishment of such clinics in university law departments and provide incentives to allow 
students to practice in court under the supervision of a senior lawyer or a law professor.  
</p>
<p>70. Paralegal programmes are often the only feasible way of delivering effective legal 
aid in countries where there are not enough lawyers to provide the legal aid services 
required by the population. Both guideline 14 of the United Nations Principles and 
Guidelines and the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice 
System in Africa35 recognize the role played by paralegals or similar service providers in 
providing legal aid services where access to lawyers is limited. The Lilongwe Declaration, 
for example, recognizes that, in the African context, relying on non-lawyers, including law 
students, paralegals and legal assistants, is the only way of ensuring access to the justice 
system, and that an effective legal aid system should employ complementary legal and law-
related services by paralegals and legal assistants.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur considers that the benefits of a legal aid system based on the 
support of paralegals should not be underestimated. Paralegals can provide legal aid 
services on a volunteer basis or at a very low cost. They often work together with trained 
workers, social workers and other professionals, and since they usually live and work 
within the community, they often have direct knowledge of the situation and needs of the 
community that legal professionals working outside frequently do not. Non-lawyers or 
paralegals can provide clients with assistance during hearings, procedures and negotiations. 
They can further assist with the drafting of documents and support licensed lawyers during 
the investigation of cases and interviews with clients and witnesses, thus helping to 
accelerate the pace of legal procedures and alleviating the heavy case loads of lawyers. 
</p>
<p>72. States should develop training programmes and a code of conduct to which all 
paralegals are bound so that they may offer effective legal aid services, such as proper legal 
advice or even by participating in court proceedings where and when there is a lack of 
lawyers to do so. 
</p>
<p> (iii) Funding 
</p>
<p>73. Regardless of the nature and model of legal aid schemes, States should make 
appropriate budget provisions for legal aid services that are commensurate to their needs so 
as to ensure that prompt and effective legal aid services are provided to all individuals 
within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction who would not otherwise be able to 
afford the costs associated with initiating and pursuing legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>74. Funding for legal aid should include legal assistance in criminal, civil and 
administrative cases. Some States have completely separate systems for criminal and civil 
</p>
<p>  
 35 Adopted by consensus by the participating countries in the Conference on Legal Aid in Criminal 
</p>
<p>Justice: the Role of Lawyers, Non-Lawyers and other Service Providers in Africa, held in Lilongwe, 
from 22 to 24 November 2004. </p>


<p>legal aid,36 while others have merged ones.37 Although there is no indication that one 
system should prevail over the other, it is important that, in one-budget systems, funding is 
not shared to the complete detriment of civil and administrative legal aid. Setting up 
specific &#8220;impact litigation&#8221; funds in the area of civil legal aid, with specific eligibility 
</p>
<p>criteria based on the fact that the selected cases should be likely to set a precedent that 
benefits the population at large, can also be seen as a cost-effective way to support civil 
legal aid when resources are scarce.38  
</p>
<p>75. To this end, guideline 12 of the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access 
to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems recommends that States take all appropriate 
measures to establish a legal aid fund to finance legal aid schemes, including public 
defender schemes, to support legal aid provision by legal or bar associations, support 
university clinics, and sponsor non-governmental and other organizations, including 
paralegal organizations, in providing legal aid services throughout the country. States 
should also identify appropriate fiscal mechanisms for channelling funds to legal aid, such 
as by allocating a percentage of the State&#8223;s budget for the administration of justice to legal 
aid services and using funds recovered from criminal activities to cover legal aid for 
victims.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize the importance of technical 
cooperation for the development and implementation of a sustainable and effective system 
of legal aid. In many countries, legal aid services rely solely on the financial assistance of 
donors, and may be thus terminated at any time. To ensure the sustainability of legal aid 
services, technical assistance based on the needs and priorities identified by requesting 
States should be provided by relevant United Nations specialized agencies, programmes 
and funds, States, donors and non-governmental organizations in the framework of bilateral 
or multilateral cooperation, with a view to building and enhancing national legal aid 
systems.39  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind States that, in accordance with Article 1, 
paragraph 3 and Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations and with well-
established principles of international law, international cooperation for development and 
thus for the realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms is an obligation 
incumbent upon all States, particularly those in a position to assist others in this regard.  
</p>
<p>78. International non-governmental organizations can also contribute to the funding of 
legal aid schemes by offering technical support and exchanging information on best 
practices on how to implement, develop and maintain legal aid programmes. This type of 
funding, while generally only able to complement other forms of funding, certainly helps to 
broaden the provision of legal services, especially in States that lack resources to do so. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that, although legal aid is an essential 
feature of the right of access to justice, States should also take measures in other fields to 
guarantee this right. Such measures include, inter alia, the simplification of judicial and 
</p>
<p>  
 36 For example, see the Criminal Defence Service and the Community Legal Service in England and 
</p>
<p>Wales. 
 37 See for example the Legal Aid Board in South Africa (see 
</p>

<p>extrajudicial procedures, the provision of legal information and education to the population 
and the development of self-representation mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> (iv) Legal aid for women, children and groups with special needs 
</p>
<p>80. The right to equality before the courts and tribunals as enunciated in article 14, 
paragraph 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aims to guarantee 
equal access to the administration of justice. This provision not only requires States to 
prohibit any distinction with regard to access to courts and tribunals that are not based on law 
and cannot be justified on objective and reasonable grounds, but also requires them to take 
positive measures to ensure that no individual is deprived of his or her right to claim justice. 
</p>
<p>81. In a previous report, the Special Rapporteur noted that the lack of public policies to 
eliminate obstacles to access to justice for all has a greater impact on groups in a vulnerable 
situation or living in extreme poverty, or who are culturally, economically or socially 
disadvantaged.40 In order to ensure equal and effective access to legal aid for those lacking 
sufficient means, legal aid must be provided to all persons regardless of age, race, colour, 
sex, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin or 
property, citizenship or domicile, birth, education or social status or other status.  
</p>
<p>82. In order to guarantee equal and effective access to legal aid to everyone, special 
measures should be developed and taken to ensure meaningful access to legal aid for 
women, children and groups with special needs, including, but not limited to, the elderly, 
minorities, persons with disabilities, persons with mental illnesses, persons living with HIV 
and other serious contagious diseases, drug users, indigenous and aboriginal people, 
stateless persons, asylum seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and migrant workers, refugees 
and internally displaced persons. Such measures should address the special needs of these 
groups, including gender-sensitive and age-appropriate measures.41 The development of 
joint strategies to guarantee a more comprehensive, equitable and sustainable system of 
legal aid is important to ensure that these individuals have prompt access to the tools 
necessary to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>83. In a previous report, the Special Rapporteur noted that legal services designed to 
meet the particular needs of women were still rare, particularly for women living in 
poverty. In the area of free legal aid, for example, the Special Rapporteur found that women 
were in competition with men for resource allocations, and those resources were in any case 
provided for a single type of service, regardless of the fact that needs could differ.42 To 
improve access to legal aid for women, guideline 9 of the United Nations Principles and 
Guidelines recommends incorporating a gender perspective into all policies, laws, 
procedures, programmes and practices relating to legal aid; taking steps to ensure that, 
insofar as possible, female defendants, accused and victims are assisted by female lawyers; 
and providing legal aid, advice and court services in all legal proceedings to female victims 
of violence so as to ensure access to justice and avoid secondary victimization. 
</p>
<p>84. Access to justice for children requires that all children, however they come into 
contact with the law, be able to participate fully in legal proceedings. While enjoying the 
same guarantees as adults, children require special protection, as their best interests are 
paramount.43 A recent report showed that legal systems can be immensely confusing and 
difficult, if not impossible, to navigate for children, especially without the help of a legal

proceedings, to defend their rights and to make their voices heard. In practice, however, the 
availability and quality of legal aid for children both in and out of detention varies 
dramatically from one jurisdiction to another.

<p>85. Guideline 10 of the United Nations Principles and Guidelines recommends that 
States adopt special measures to promote children&#8223;s effective access to justice and to 
</p>
<p>prevent stigmatization. Such measures should include ensuring the right of the child to have 
counsel assigned to represent him or her; prohibiting any interviewing of a child in the 
absence of his or her lawyer or other legal aid provider; ensuring that children may consult 
freely and in full confidentiality with parents and/or guardians and legal representatives; 
providing information on legal rights in a manner appropriate for the child&#8223;s age and 
</p>
<p>maturity, and in a language that the child can understand; encouraging, where appropriate, 
the use of alternative measures and sanctions to the deprivation of liberty; and ensuring that 
children have the right to legal aid so that deprivation of liberty is a measure of last resort 
and for the shortest appropriate period of time. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Legal aid is an essential element of a fair, human and efficient system of 
administration of justice that is based on the rule of law. It is a foundation for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to an 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective remedy, a precondition to exercising such rights and an important safeguard 
</b></p>
<p><b>that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the administration of justice.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that the aim of legal aid is to contribute to 
the elimination of obstacles and barriers that impair or restrict access to justice by 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal counsel, representation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and access to the court system. Accordingly, the definition of legal aid should be as 
</b></p>
<p><b>broad as possible and include the provision of effective legal assistance in any judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>or extrajudicial procedure aimed at determining rights and obligations. Furthermore, 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal aid should not be limited to covering only legal assistance and representation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal, administrative and civil proceedings, but should also include legal education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to legal information and other services provided through alternative dispute 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution mechanisms and restorative justice processes. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> In accordance with this broader definition of legal aid services, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that notion of beneficiaries of legal aid should not only include 
</b></p>
<p><b>defendants in criminal proceedings but should also include (a) any person whose 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights or freedoms have been violated as a result of an act, or a failure to act, 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrated by a State actor; and (b) any person who participates in judicial or 
</b></p>
<p><b>extrajudicial procedures aimed at determining rights and obligations </b>&#8220;<b>in a suit at 
</b></p>
<p><b>law</b>&#8221;<b>.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> States bear the primary responsibility to develop and implement an effective 
and sustainable legal aid system that draws from international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and recognized good practices. If the right to legal aid is not already 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteed by national legislation or practices, States are required to make such 
</b></p>
<p><b>changes to their legislation and practices as necessary to ensure their conformity with

<p><b>the international legal obligations that they have undertaken. Legal aid systems 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be institutionalized so that they can be duly organized and monitored and 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers can be held accountable in the event that they fail to offer adequate, proper, 
</b></p>
<p><b>timely and effective services.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes that, in practice, many countries still lack the 
necessary resources and capacity to promote the right of everyone to free legal aid, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that the inadequacy of funds to ensure legal support for those who do not have 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient financial means adversely affects their access to justice and, consequently, 
</b></p>
<p><b>their equal and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> With due regard for the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to 
Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations below with the aim of assisting States in developing and taking 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate and effective measures to strengthen access to legal aid in their justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation on legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The right to legal aid should be legally guaranteed in national legal systems at 
the highest possible level, if possible by the Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> States should consider enacting specific legislation to establish a comprehensive 
legal aid system that is accessible, effective, sustainable and credible.  
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> Legislation on legal aid should, inter alia: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Contain a broad definition of legal aid; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop specific criteria to determine eligibility for legal aid; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that effective legal assistance is provided at all stages of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal justice process, at the pretrial stage and in any non-criminal judicial or 
</b></p>
<p><b>extrajudicial procedure aimed at determining rights and obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that information on the right to legal aid and in what such aid 
</b></p>
<p><b>consists, including the availability of legal aid services and how to gain access to them, is 
</b></p>
<p><b>made available to the general public through all appropriate means, including the media 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Internet, as well as in any facility where persons are imprisoned or detained; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Determine the minimum qualifications and training of professionals and 
</b></p>
<p><b>paralegals working for the legal aid system. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Establishment of a national legal aid system 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> States should identify, among the different models for the provision of legal aid, 
the one that can maximise access to free legal aid for all individuals within its territory 
</b></p>
<p><b>and subject to its jurisdiction, taking into account the scope and funding of legal aid 
</b></p>
<p><b>schemes, the type of justice systems to which they belong and the area of jurisdiction 
</b></p>
<p><b>where they function.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> States should consider establishing independent legal aid agencies or 
</b>authorities, such as public defenders&#8217; offices, that provide, administer, coordinate and 
</p>
<p><b>monitor legal aid services. State-run legal aid schemes, regardless of their </b></p>


<p><b>administrative structure, should be free from undue political or judicial interference 
</b></p>
<p><b>and be independent of Government in decision-making related to legal aid.  
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Where responsibilities to provide legal aid are shared among State institutions 
and non-State legal aid providers, appropriate mechanisms should be put in place to 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate coordination among different legal aid providers and thus maximize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness of the legal aid system. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> States should encourage bar associations to develop legal aid programmes or to 
support existing systems in order to ensure a broader reach of the legal aid services 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided or of pro bono legal aid. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Where appropriate, States should establish partnerships with bar associations 
and legal clinics to ensure the provision of legal aid at all stages of criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings, at the pretrial stage and in any non-criminal judicial or extrajudicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure aimed at determining rights and obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> States should take appropriate measures to encourage the support and 
establishment of the above-mentioned clinics in university law departments, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide incentives to law students to participate in legal aid clinic schemes as part of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their academic curriculum or professional development. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Where there is a shortage of qualified lawyers, States should develop a 
nationwide network of paralegal services with standardized training curricula and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accreditation schemes.  
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> In cooperation with private legal aid providers, States should develop criteria 
for the accreditation of legal aid providers; ensure that legal aid providers are subject 
</b></p>
<p><b>to applicable professional codes of conduct; put in place mechanisms to ensure that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal aid providers possess adequate education, training, skills and experience that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>commensurate with the nature of their work; and establish appropriate oversight 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms for legal aid providers, in particular to prevent them from receiving any 
</b></p>
<p><b>payment from the beneficiaries of legal aid, except when authorized to do so.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Funding of legal aid schemes 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> Regardless of the nature and model of legal aid schemes, States should make 
appropriate budgetary provisions for legal aid services that are commensurate to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their needs. To this end, States should take all appropriate measures to establish a 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal aid fund to finance legal aid schemes, and identify appropriate fiscal mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>for channelling funds to legal aid.  
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> To facilitate the development and strengthening of national legal aid systems, 
United Nations specialized agencies, programmes and funds, States, donors and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations should provide technical assistance based on the needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>and priorities identified by requesting States in the framework of bilateral or 
</b></p>
<p><b>multilateral cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Legal aid for women, children and groups with special needs 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> Recognizing that the lack of public policies to eliminate obstacles to access to 
justice for all has a greater impact on groups in a vulnerable situation or living in 
</b></p>
<p><b>extreme poverty, States should develop and implement appropriate policies to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningful access to legal aid for women, children and groups with special needs. 
</b></p>
