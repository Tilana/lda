<p><b>  20</b>/&#8230;<b> The right to education: follow-up to Human Rights Council 
 resolution 8/4 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 of 18 June 2008 and all other 
Council resolutions on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 17/3 of 
16 June 2011, and recalling the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights 
on the subject, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, 
inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant international 
instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 64/290 of 9 July 2010 on the right to 
education in emergency situations, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming</i> the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights 
Education and Training by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/137 of 19 December 
2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization, although there has been progress in many areas, the world is not on 
track to achieve the Education for All targets set for 2015 and that most of the goals will be 
missed by a wide margin, and by the particular challenges faced in that regard by countries 
affected by armed conflicts, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the role that the full realization of the right to education plays in helping 
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and noting in this regard the commitments 
relating to education contained in the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting 
of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,1 including to ensure 
quality education and progression through the school system, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that the lack of enjoyment of the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation, among others, can also have a serious negative impact on the enjoyment of 
the right to education, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the thematic report entitled &#8220;Tackling violence in schools: a global 
perspectives&#8212;bridging the gap between standards and practice&#8221; prepared by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to take all measures to implement Human Rights 
Council resolutions 8/4, 11/6 of 17 June 2009, 15/4 of 29 September 2010 and 17/3 with a 
view to ensuring the full realization of the right to education for all; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Notes with appreciation</i>: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education on normative 
action for quality education;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/20/21. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The work of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special 
procedures in the promotion of the right to education; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in the promotion of the right to education at the country, 
regional and headquarters levels; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The contribution of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other relevant bodies towards 
attaining the Millennium Development Goals of achieving universal primary education and 
eliminating gender disparity in education and the goals of the Education for All agenda; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) International initiatives to promote quality in education, including at the 
regional level; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> all relevant stakeholders urgently to increase their efforts so that 
the goals of the Education for All agenda can be achieved by 2015; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> all States to give full effect to the right to education by, inter alia, 
promoting quality education by such means as: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The development and strengthening of domestic legal and policy frameworks 
in that regard for the entire education system; 
</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The implementation of quality assessments with a view to promoting 
equitable education systems, learning opportunities and the empowerment of women, 
giving particular consideration to the educational needs of segments of the population that 
are economically and socially marginalized; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The provision of a healthy, hygienic and safe learning environment, with 
adequate water and sanitation facilities, including sex-segregated toilets, and healthy 
classrooms;  
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The improvement of teachers&#8217; qualifications and working conditions; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) The allocation of adequate financial resources to quality education, including 
through national and international resource mobilization and international cooperation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Support for research and encouragement of further debate on quality 
education; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) The putting in place of regular mechanisms for dialogue that will enable 
individuals, civil society organizations and all relevant stakeholders to contribute, where 
appropriate, to the planning, monitoring and evaluation of the realization of the right to 
education; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> States and other relevant stakeholders to pay enhanced attention to 
education in emergency situations by, inter alia, enhancing the protection of schools from 
attacks and strengthening safety and disaster risk reduction; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages</i> the Office of the High Commissioner, the treaty bodies, the 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council and other relevant United Nations bodies 
and mechanisms, specialized agencies and programmes, within their respective mandates, 
to continue their efforts to promote the realization of the right to education worldwide and 
to enhance their cooperation in this regard, including by enhancing technical assistance to 
Governments;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Stresses the importance</i> of the contribution of national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental and civil society organizations to the realization of the 
right to education, including through cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the right 
to education; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter. 
</p>
