1.
Nature of Operations and Going Concern
Contact  Minerals  Corp.  (the  “Company”)  was  incorporated  in  the  State  of  Nevada  on  April  25,  2007.  The  Company’s  principal  business  is  the
acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company does not currently own any mineral properties.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its
liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  Company  has  never  generated  revenue  and  has  never  paid  any  dividends  and  is  unlikely  to  pay
dividends or generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the
continued  financial  support  from  its  stockholders,  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  obtain  necessary  equity  financing  to  continue  operations  and  to
determine the existence, discovery and successful exploitation of economically recoverable reserves in the prospective properties, the confirmation of
the Company’s interests in the underlying properties, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at January 31, 2016, the Company has a working
capital deficiency of $200,940 and has accumulated losses of $900,980 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded
asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company plans
to continue to review and assess new mineral exploration or development projects for acquisition. The Company intends to fund these activities through
debt and equity financing arrangements. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary financing to complete its objectives.
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information and with the instructions for Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10-Q and they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited annual financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended July 31, 2015, included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on October 28, 2015, with the SEC.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation of the Company’s
financial  position,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  have  been  included.  Operating  results  for  the  six  months  ended  January  31,  2016,  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future quarters or the year ending July 31, 2016.
3.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC  825,  Financial  Instruments,  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  when
measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to
measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. ASC 825 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent
transactions  (less  active  markets);  or  model-derived  valuations  in  which  significant  inputs  are  observable  or  can  be  derived  principally  from,  or
corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the
fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The  financial  instruments  consist  principally  of  cash,  bank  indebtedness,  accounts  payable,  and due  to  related parties.  The  fair  value of  cash  when
applicable is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the
recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity
dates or durations.
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were presented on the Company’s balance sheet as of January 31, 2016 and July 31, 2015, as follows:

The Company does not have any liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented on the Company’s balance sheet as of January 31, 2016

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash. The Company limits its exposure
to credit loss by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute "forward-looking statements." These statements, identified by words such as
“plan,” "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "should," "expect" and similar expressions include our expectations and objectives regarding our future financial
position, operating results and business strategy. These statements reflect the current views of management with respect to future events and are subject to risks,
uncertainties  and  other  factors  that  may  cause  our  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements,  or  industry  results,  to  be  materially  different  from  those
described  in  the  forward-looking  statements.  Such  risks  and  uncertainties  include  those  set  forth  under  the  caption  “Part  II  – Item  1A.  Risk  Factors” and
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We do not intend to update the forward-looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting such
forward-looking information. We advise you to carefully review the reports and documents, particularly our Annual Reports, our Quarterly Reports and our
Current Reports we file from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Copies of all of our filings with the SEC
may be accessed by visiting the SEC site (http://www.sec.gov) and performing a search of our electronic filings.
As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms "we,” "us,” "our,” and “Contact” mean Contact Minerals Corp. unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts in this
Quarterly Report are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.
OVERVIEW
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007.
We currently have no business operations or significant assets. We plan to identify and acquire an interest in a mineral property. The acquisition of a mineral
property  will  be  dependent  upon  our  possessing  sufficient  capital  resources  at  the  time  to  purchase  such  mineral  property.  We  have  not  entered  into  any
discussions, understandings, arrangements or other agreements, preliminary or otherwise, for acquiring any mineral property and/or funding arrangements for
the purpose of acquiring a mineral property.
PLAN OF OPERATION
Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to identify and acquire an interest in a mineral property on which we will carry out exploration activities. We
are unable to provide an estimate of our exact financial needs for the next twelve months. However, as at January 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $3,611 and a
working capital deficit of $200,940. As such, we will require additional financing in the near future in order to meet our current obligations and to continue our
operations. In addition, in the event that we are successful in identifying a mineral property, of which there is no assurance, we anticipate that we will need to
obtain financing in order to pursue an exploration program.

mineral property, discover proven reserves on such mineral property, or if such deposits are discovered, that we will enter into further exploration programs.

During the three months ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, as a result of large foreign currency gains we recorded operating incomes of $2,109 and $9,968,
respectively. Our operating income decreased as a result of a decrease in foreign currency gain and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The
increase was offset by a decrease in professional services.
During the six months ended January 31,2016 and 2015, we recorded operating expenses of $17,010 and $2,406, respectively. Our operating expenses increased
as a result of a decrease in foreign currency gain and an increase in general and administrative expenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in
professional services.
Professional services primarily consist of legal and accounting fees in connection with meeting our ongoing reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
We do not currently pay any management fees to our sole executive officer and director or any rent for use of our office. However, we recognize $1,000 per
month for donated management fees and $500 per month for donated rent provided by our sole executive officer and director.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly if we are able to identify and acquire an interest in a mineral property and pursue an exploration
program on a mineral property. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to identify and acquire an interest in a mineral property.

We had cash on hand of $3,611 and a working capital deficit of $200,940 as at January 31, 2016 compared to cash on hand of $5,586 and a working capital
deficit of $192,930 as at July 31, 2015. Our working capital deficit increased as a result of decreases of cash in order to meet ongoing operating expenses and
increases in loans from related parties.
Financing Requirements
Our ability to identify and acquire a mineral property is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing in the near term. We anticipate that such
funding will be in the form of equity financing from sales of our common stock. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding
from the sale of our common stock to fund our business plan should we decide to proceed. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding
the acquisition of a mineral property or the exploration of such mineral property. The risky nature of this enterprise and lack of tangible assets places debt
financing beyond the credit-worthiness required by most banks or typical investors of corporate debt until such time as an economically viable mine can be
demonstrated.
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and advances from our sole executive officer and director in order to continue to fund our
business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our business operations.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements presented with this Quarterly Report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America for interim financial information. These financial statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures required for an annual set
of financial statements prepared under United States generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments (consisting
solely of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as at January 31,
2016, and for all periods presented in the attached financial statements, have been included. Interim results for the six months ended January 31, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year as a whole.
5
We  have  identified  certain  accounting  policies,  described  below,  that  are  most  important  to  the  portrayal  of  our  current  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the interim financial statements included with this Quarterly Report.
Mineral Property Costs
We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized in
accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, when management has determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future
cash  inflows  have  been  identified  and  adequate  financial  resources  are  available  or  are  expected  to  be  available  as  required  to  meet  the  terms  of  property
acquisition and budgeted exploration and development expenditures. Mineral property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred if the criteria for capitalization
are not met. In the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of our shares, the mineral property will be recorded at the fair value of the
respective property or the fair value of common shares, whichever is more readily determinable.
When  mineral  properties  are  acquired  under  option  agreements  with  future  acquisition  payments  to  be  made  at  our  sole  discretion,  those  future  payments,
whether in cash or shares, are recorded only when we have made or are obliged to make the payment or issue the shares. When it has been determined that a
mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and pre feasibility, the costs incurred to develop such
property are capitalized.
Donated Capital
We reflect donated capital, such as outright gifts to us by way of donated management services provided, in the Statement of Operations. Donated management
services are recognized if the services received (a) create or enhance non-financial assets, or (b) require specialized skills, are provided by individuals possessing
these skills, and would typically need to be purchased if not provided by donation.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
January 31, 2016 (the “Evaluation Date”). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief  Financial  Officer.  Based  upon  that  evaluation,  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures were not effective as of the Evaluation Date as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting disclosed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2015 (the “2015 Annual Report”).
Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in our
2015 Annual Report, we believe that our financial statements contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2016 fairly
present our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in all material respects.

Changes in Internal Controls
There  were  no  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  January  31,  2016  that  have  materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
We are not a party to any other legal proceedings and, to our knowledge; no other legal proceedings are pending, threatened or contemplated.
ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS.
The following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates
contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.
If we do not obtain additional financing, our business will fail.
As of January 31, 2016, we had cash in the amount of $3,611. We plan to identify and acquire an interest in a mineral property. Our ability to acquire a mineral
property will be dependent upon obtaining additional financing. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including the market
prices  for  the  mineral  property  and  gold,  silver,  copper  and  iron.  These  factors  may  make  the  timing,  amount,  terms  or  conditions  of  additional  financing
unavailable to us. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us.
Because of the speculative nature of exploration of mining properties, there is substantial risk that our business will fail.
We were incorporated on April 25, 2007 and, to date, have been involved primarily in organizational activities and the acquisition of a mineral property, which
has since lapsed. We have not earned any revenues as of the date of this report. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses,
difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with acquiring a mineral property and the exploration of an acquired the mineral property.
These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to exploration, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed
current  estimates.  Assuming  that  we  are  able  to  acquire  a  mineral  property,  prior  to  completion  of  our  exploration  stage,  we  anticipate  that  we  will  incur
increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are
unable to generate significant revenues from development and production of minerals from a claim, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations.
There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating
revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.
Even if we discover proven reserves of precious metals on a mineral property, we may not be able to successfully commence commercial production.
Assuming that we are able to acquire a mineral property, if an exploration program is successful in discovering proven reserves on a mineral property, we will
require additional funds in order to place a mineral property into commercial production. The expenditures to be made by us in the exploration of a mineral
property  in  all  probability  will  be  lost  as  it  is  an  extremely  remote  possibility  that  the  mineral  claim  will  contain  proven  reserves.  The  funds  required  for
commercial mineral production can range from several million to hundreds of millions. We currently do not have sufficient funds to place a mineral property
into commercial production. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including the market prices for gold, silver, copper and
iron,  and  the  costs  of  exploring  for  or  mining  these  materials.  These  factors  may  make  the  timing,  amount,  terms  or  conditions  of  additional  financing
unavailable to us. Because we will need additional financing to fund our exploration activities, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. At this time, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain such financing as and when needed.
8
Because we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase prior to our earning revenues, we may never achieve profitability.
Assuming that  we  are able  to acquire a  mineral  property, prior  to  completion  of an  exploration  stage, we anticipate that  we will  incur  increased operating
expenses without realizing any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses  into the  foreseeable future. We  recognize that if we  are  unable to
generate revenues from the exploration of a mineral property, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base
any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever
achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.
Because of the inherent dangers involved in mineral exploration, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business.
The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and developing mineral properties. As a result, we may
become  subject  to  liability  for  such  hazards,  including  pollution,  cave-ins,  unusual  or  unexpected  geological  formations,  environmental  pollution,  personal
injuries, flooding, changes in technology or mining techniques, periodic interruptions, industrial accidents, and other hazards against which we cannot insure or
against which we may elect not to insure. At the present time we have no coverage to insure against these hazards and have no plans to insure against these
hazards. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
If we receive positive results from an exploration program and we decide to pursue commercial production, we may be subject to an environmental
review process that may delay or prohibit commercial production.
Assuming that we are able to acquire a mineral property, if we enter a production phase, the cost of complying with permit and regulatory environment laws will
be greater because the impact on the project area is greater. Permits and regulations will control all aspects of the production program if the project continues to
that stage. Examples of regulatory requirements include:
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
(vii)
Water discharge will have to meet drinking water standards;
Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise re-mediated;
Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated with natural vegetation;
An assessment of all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign;
Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants;
The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be remediated; and
There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora including a study of potentially endangered species.
There is the possibility that we would not be able to proceed with commercial production upon completion of the environmental review process if government
authorities did not approve our mine or if the costs of compliance with government regulation adversely affected the commercial viability of the proposed mine.
Because our sole executive officer does not have formal training specific to the technicalities of mineral exploration, there is a higher risk that our
business will fail.
Kerry J. McCullagh, our sole executive officer and sole director, does not have any formal training as a geologist or in the technical aspects of management of a
mineral exploration company. With no direct training in these areas, our management may not be fully aware of the specific technical requirements related to
working within this industry. Although Mr. McCullagh has some extensive business experience with exploration companies, his decisions and choices may not
take  into  account  standard  exploration  or  managerial  approaches  mineral  exploration  companies  commonly  use.  Consequently,  our  operations  and  ultimate
financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management’s lack of technical know-how in this industry.
9
We  are  highly  dependent  on  our  senior  management.  The  loss  of  our  sole  executive  officer  could  hinder  our  ability  to  pursue  our  stated  plan  of
operation and obtain debt or equity financing, if and when required.
We  believe  that  our  continued  success  depends  to  a  significant  extent  upon  the  efforts  and  abilities  of  our  senior  management  and  in  particular  Kerry  J.
McCullagh, our sole executive officer and director. Mr. McCullagh has worked in the mining exploration industry for over 20 years. We believe that the loss of
Mr. McCullagh's business and management experience could hinder our ability to pursue our stated plan of operation and obtain debt or equity financing, if and
when required.
Because our sole executive officer has only agreed to provide his services on a part-time basis, he may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient
amount of time to our business operations, which may cause our business to fail.
Kerry J. McCullagh, our sole executive officer and director, is also a principal of Polar Capital Corp., now a private British Columbia consulting company
providing management and administrative services to mining exploration companies. Because we are in the early stages of our business, Mr. McCullagh devotes
approximately 10 hours per week to our affairs. If the demands of our business require the full business time of Mr. McCullagh, he is prepared to adjust his
timetable to devote up to 20 hours a week. However, Mr. McCullagh may not be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business, as and when
needed. It is possible that the demands of Mr. McCullagh's other business interests will increase with the result that he would no longer be able to devote
sufficient  time  to  the  management  of  our  business.  Competing  demands  on  Mr.  McCullagh's  time  may  lead  to  a  divergence  between  his  interests  and  the
interests of other shareholders.
Because our sole executive officer and sole director owns 42% of our outstanding common stock, investors may find that corporate decisions influenced
by Mr. McCullagh are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders.
Kerry J. McCullagh, our sole executive officer and sole director, controls 42% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, in
accordance with our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, Mr. McCullagh is able to significantly influence who is elected to our board of directors and thus
could act, or could have the power to act, as our management. The interests of Mr. McCullagh may not be, at all times, the same as those of other shareholders.
Since Mr. McCullagh is not simply a passive investor but is also our sole executive officer, his interests as an executive may, at times, be adverse to those of
passive investors. Where those conflicts exist, our shareholders will be dependent upon Mr. McCullagh exercising, in a manner fair to all of our shareholders,
his  fiduciary  duties  as  an  officer  or  as  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors.  In  addition,  Mr.  McCullagh  will  have  the  ability  to  significantly  influence  the
outcome  of  most  corporate  actions  requiring  shareholder  approval,  including  the  merger  of  our  company  with  or  into  another  company,  the  sale  of  all  or
substantially all of our assets and amendments to our Articles of Incorporation. This concentration of ownership with Mr. McCullagh may also have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Contact, which may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders.
Because our stock is a penny stock, shareholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their stock.
The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities
with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current
price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or quotation system.
Because our securities constitute “penny stocks” within the meaning of the rules, the rules apply to us and to our securities. The rules may further affect the
ability of owners of shares to sell our securities in any market that might develop for them. As long as the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00
per share, the common stock will be subject to rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a
penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that:
10
1.
2.

contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;
contains  a  description  of the  broker’s  or  dealer’s  duties  to  the customer  and  of the  rights  and  remedies available to the  customer with  respect to a
violation to such duties or other requirements of securities laws;
contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between
the bid and ask price;
contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;
defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and
contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.
The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with: (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b)
the  compensation  of  the  broker-dealer  and  its  salesperson  in  the  transaction;  (c)  the  number  of  shares  to  which  such  bid  and  ask  prices  apply,  or  other
comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from
those  rules;  the  broker-dealer  must  make  a  special  written  determination  that  the  penny  stock  is  a  suitable  investment  for  the  purchaser  and  receive  the
purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and
dated copy of a written suitably statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our
stock.
