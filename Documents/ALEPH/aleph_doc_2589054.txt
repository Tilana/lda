Summit Materials Announces Second Quarter 2016 Results
Denver, Colorado (August 3, 2016) — Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE: SUM, “Summit” or the “Company”), a leading vertically integrated
construction materials company, announces results for the second quarter of 2016. The Company has posted supplementary materials
to its investor relations website.
Highlights – Second Quarter 2016 Compared to Second Quarter 2015:
·Aggregates volume and price increased 10.9% and 9.5%, respectively; organic price up 6.7%
·Cement volume and price increased 114.7% and 10.7%, respectively
·Net income grew to $21.5 million
·Basic EPS of $0.22; Adjusted EPS improved to $0.46
·Adjusted EBITDA grew to $114.7 million and improved 400 basis points to 27.8% as a percent of net revenue
·Gross margin expanded 360 basis points to 38.8%, representing an incremental gross margin of 53.0%
·In April 2016, entered the Las Vegas, Nevada market through the acquisition of a vertically integrated aggregates and ready-mixed
concrete business, providing Summit with premier, well-located assets in an expanding market
·In May 2016, acquired seven aggregates quarries in central and northwest Missouri adding over 100 million tons of permitted reserves,
primarily serving infrastructure and nonresidential demand 
·Full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA outlook upwardly revised to a range of $360.0 million  to $370.0 million
Tom Hill, CEO of Summit, stated, “We’ve made considerable progress over the past year integrating acquisitions, which contributed
significantly to our net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in the second quarter of 2016. Our materials-based growth strategy was
evident with higher aggregates and cement exposure benefitting our overall gross margin performance. In cement, the successful
integration of Davenport helped more than double Cement segment Adjusted EBITDA.  The positive cement market fundamentals in
the Mississippi river region resulted in both volume and price improvements. The Boxley, AMC and Sierra acquisitions completed
during the year have all exceeded expectations and expanded our geographic footprint into several high growth markets. In our legacy
businesses, we were pleased to achieve another quarter of organic price growth across all lines of business, including aggregates up
6.7%, helped by our effective price optimization focus. We experienced strong activity in North Texas highway demand and overall
improvement in Utah, Kansas and Missouri. That said, organic volumes were softer overall due to wet weather, especially in Texas,
lower aggregates volume in Vancouver with the completion of a large sand river project in 2015 and some competitive pressure in
Austin, Texas. We expect all three of these factors to improve in the second half of the year as we make additional progress to grow our
company. Moving forward in 2016, we are firmly situated to achieve our Adjusted EBITDA goals for the full year.”
Brian Harris, CFO of Summit, said, “We ended the second quarter with net leverage of 4.5x primarily reflecting the 46.8% increase in
Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. We were pleased to achieve this while funding two bolt-on transactions during the quarter and
surpassing our targeted $30 million of annualized acquired Adjusted EBITDA. Our capital investments in our announced aggregates
facility enhancement initiatives are also moving forward on schedule
1
and on budget. With the continuation of strong results from our materials based-strategy along with ample liquidity on our balance
sheet, we have the flexibility to pursue our strategy of acquiring attractively positioned reserves in attractive markets with selective
downstream exposure, while maintaining our commitment to reduce our leverage ratios by year end.”
Second Quarter 2016 Operating Results
In the second quarter of 2016, net revenue increased 25.4% to $412.6 million, compared to $329.0 million in the prior year quarter. The
improvement in net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in volumes across all lines of business and higher prices in
aggregates, cement and asphalt. Net revenue growth from acquisitions in the West and East segments was $56.5 million compared to
the prior year quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 46.8% to $114.7 million, compared to $78.1 million in the prior year quarter, with growth in all operating
segments. As a percentage of net revenue, Adjusted EBITDA improved to 27.8%, up 400 basis points from the prior year quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA by segment in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year quarter was as follows:
·West: Increased $10.9 million to $50.6 million, primarily driven by organic price growth in all lines of business and the impact of
acquisitions in the Utah-based market.
·East: Increased $6.1 million to $35.7 million, mainly as a result of a higher mix of revenue from aggregates, organic improvement in
aggregates and ready mix, and the impact of acquisitions in the Mid-Atlantic market.
·Cement: Increased $21.8 million to $37.6 million, largely attributable to higher volume and price due to the favorable impact of the
Davenport cement plant acquisition and stronger end market demand.
Gross profit increased 38.3% to $160.1 million, compared to $115.8 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of net revenue,
gross margin improved to 38.8%, compared to 35.2% in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to a higher percentage of revenue
from materials and cost saving initiatives.
·Aggregates Results – Net revenue from aggregates increased 23.4% to $73.0 million. Aggregates organic price increased 6.7% with
the improvement due to higher overall prices. Aggregates volumes grew 10.9% attributable to acquisitions. Gross margin from
aggregates of 63.3% compared to 64.3% in the prior year quarter.    
·Cement Results – Net revenue from cement grew 142.3% to $70.0 million. Cement volume and price increased 114.7% and 10.7%,
respectively, mainly attributable to the acquisition of the Davenport cement plant and overall improved market pricing. Gross margin
from cement expanded to 52.2% from 51.1% in the prior year quarter.  
·Products Results – Net revenue from products increased 14.5% to $198.3 million. Ready-mixed concrete volumes were up 9.4%
primarily resulting from acquisitions. Ready-mixed concrete organic price increased 1.2%, largely benefitting from the pass through of
higher cement prices. Asphalt price rose 1.7%, mainly due to a shift in geographic mix. Gross margin from products expanded to 26.9%
compared to 25.9% in the prior year quarter.
In the second quarter of 2016, net income attributable to Summit Materials, Inc. was $13.4 million, and basic EPS was $0.22 per share
of Class A common stock. The shares of Class A common stock are issued by Summit Materials, Inc., and as such the earnings and
equity interests of noncontrolling interests, including LP units, are not included in basic earnings per share.
Adjusted net income was $46.2 million and Adjusted EPS was $0.46 per diluted share. Summit believes adjusted net income and
Adjusted EPS are more representative of earnings performance, because these measures exclude the non-operating impact to
earnings per share of any potential conversions of LP units to Class A common stock in any given quarter.

Acquisitions
In April 2016, Summit acquired Sierra Ready Mix, (“Sierra”), a vertically integrated aggregates and ready-mixed concrete business
located in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Sierra is a well-established aggregates and ready mix concrete supplier in the Las Vegas market with
an excellent reputation for quality and service. Sierra operates a sand & gravel pit and two ready-mixed concrete facilities and has well-
balanced exposure across all end-use segments. The acquisition provides Summit with premier, well-located assets in an expanding
market.
In May 2016, Summit acquired seven aggregates quarries in central and northwest Missouri from Oldcastle Materials. These quarries
added over 100 million tons of permitted reserves, primarily serving infrastructure and nonresidential demand, which enhances the
scale and aggregate reserves position of Summit’s existing presence in Missouri.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At July 2, 2016, the Company had cash of $9.2 million, total outstanding debt of $1,537.2 million and a borrowing capacity of $195.4
million. Our borrowing capacity is net of $25.6 million outstanding letters of credit and $14.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the
revolving credit facility.
Full Year 2016 Outlook
For the full year 2016, based on current market conditions, Summit expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $360.0 million
to $370.0 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $287.5 million in 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA outlook assumes organic
improvement, along with the successor period for acquisitions completed through today’s date.
Summit continues to target approximately $30.0 million of annualized Adjusted EBITDA per year from acquisitions. The upwardly
revised full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA outlook range of $360.0 million to $370.0 million excludes the potential upside from any future
acquisitions due to the unspecified closing dates of any future acquisitions, the timing of which will impact the magnitude of acquired
Adjusted EBITDA realized in 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulates the use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as adjusted net income,
Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit and free cash outflow, which are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). We have provided these measures because, among
other things, we believe that they provide investors with additional information to measure our performance, evaluate our ability to
service our debt and evaluate certain flexibility under our restrictive covenants. Our adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted
EBITDA, gross profit and free cash outflow, may vary from the use of such terms by others and should not be considered as alternatives
to or more important than net income (loss), operating income (loss), revenue or any other performance measures derived in
accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in
isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA are that
these measures do not reflect: (i) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
(ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service
interest and principal payments on our debt; and (iv) income tax payments we are required to make. Because of these limitations, we
rely primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and use Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures only supplementally.
Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS and free cash outflow reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of
our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to U.S. GAAP financial measures
included in the tables attached to this press release, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our
business. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single
financial measure.
Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in the attached tables, to the extent available
without unreasonable effort. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible, and reconciling
information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures.
For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to
future results.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and you can
identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,”
“trends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects” or “anticipates” or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, expectations or
intentions. Any and all statements made relating to the expectations for our anticipated benefits from recent acquisitions, the
macroeconomic outlook for our markets, potential acquisition activity, our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs,
expenditures, cash flows, sales volumes and financial results are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those
expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many
detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors,
and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.
In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our
objectives and plans will be achieved. Important factors could affect our results and could cause results to differ materially from those
expressed in our forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. Such factors may be updated from time to time in our
periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
