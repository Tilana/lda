employment agreement, ending June 30, 2008. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Duff will be
paid a base salary of $260,000 annually. The employment agreement also entitles Mr. Duff to receive an annual

Duff will also be eligible to receive certain other payments under the compensation and benefit plans of the Registrant.
A Change in Control Agreement is also attached as an exhibit to the employment agreement and contains

termination.
The foregoing description of the terms of the employment agreement is intended to serve as a summary of the
