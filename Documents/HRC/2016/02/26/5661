<p>*  The present report is being circulated as received, in the languages of submission only, as it 
greatly exceeds the word limitation currently used by the relevant General Assembly resolution. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">90. While the Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction that article 11 of the 2006 Law 
establishes a partial safeguard against arbitrariness by requiring immediate announcement of a 
decision to establish a counter-terrorist operation regime, indicating the area, measures and 
restrictions involved, and also a decision to terminate the regime, more substantive safeguards 
against possibly serious human rights abuses need to be introduced immediately in the 2006 
Law. Most important, in this respect, would be safeguards against arbitrary arrest or detention, as 
contained in article 9, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the ICCPR, i.e. the right to be brought promptly 
before a judge and the entitlement to trial within a reasonable amount of time or release as well 
as the right to challenge without delay the lawfulness of one&#8217;s detention before a court. As the 
Human Rights Committee confirmed in its General Comment 29 of 2001, the latter right is 
protected at all times, including during a state of emergency. This is partly because of the crucial 
role of procedural guarantees in securing compliance with the non-derogable right under article 7 
of the ICCPR not to be subjected to torture or any other form of inhuman, cruel or degrading 
treatment. It is in this connection that the Special Rapporteur appealed to the Government to 
seriously reconsider the provision contained in article 100, paragraph 2, of the Criminal 
Procedure Code, read in conjunction with articles 97 and 99 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
which prescribes that a terrorist suspect may be detained for up to 30 days without being charged 
and the subsequent lack of judicial review of the detention during this period.  
191. Furthermore, with a view to the broad discretion left to the official in charge of 
counter-terrorism operations in the implementation of the 2006 Law, clear requirements of 
suitability, necessity and proportionality of the measures taken must be introduced in the law. In 
addition, effective internal and external oversight mechanisms need to be established. </footnote>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">87. The 1998 Law on Combating Terrorism contained a clause allowing such restriction only 
&#8220;in the area of a counter-terrorist operation zone&#8221;, which was defined as &#8220;particular areas of land 
or water, vehicle, building, structure, installation, or premises and the adjoining territory or 
waters within which the aforementioned operation is carried out.&#8221; In contrast, the 2006 Law does 
not confine counter-terrorist operations to a specifically defined zone, but provides for a 
possibility of counter-terrorist operations to take place in a &#8220;territory with a substantial number 
of residents&#8221; (article 12), without, however, specifying any limitations whatsoever. This leads to 
a wide discretion to apply the &#8220;regime of counter-terrorist operation&#8221; across a large area and to 
take measures, which could seriously interfere with human rights, in particular with respect to 
civilians, within the area of the counter-terrorism operation. Moreover, the area of </footnote>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism contains summaries of 
communications transmitted to Governments between 15 September 2007 and 
31 December 2008, as well as replies received up to 31 January 2009. In addition, the report 
covers press releases issued in 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period under review the Special Rapporteur corresponded with Governments, 
either separately or jointly with other Special Procedures mandate-holders, in 30 
communications and he issued 3 press releases, all relating to a total of 26 countries or 
territories. In specific cases, the Special Rapporteur decided to address the concerns related to his 
mandate in a separate letter, instead of joining communications by other special procedures.  
3. The Special Rapporteur received replies from 13 of the 26 Governments he corresponded 
with during the period under review, including some replies to communications the Special 
Rapporteur sent that were reflected in the previous report (A/HRC/6/17/Add.<footnote name="1">86. Articles 11 and 12 of the 2006 Law set out the provisions for the legal regime and the 
terms of conducting a counter-terrorist operation. Paragraph 3 of article 11 establishes a list of 
measures and temporary procedural restrictions that can be applied, where a counter-terrorist 
operation is established. These measures and procedural alternations carry with them significant 
restrictions of human rights and fundamental liberties. 
</footnote>). Most of the 
Governments offered detailed substantive information on the allegations received. The Special 
Rapporteur underlines that it is crucial that Governments share their information and views with 
him on the allegations received. The Special Rapporteur encourages cooperation from those 
Governments which have not yet provided replies to his communications. Replies received after 
31 January 2009 and replies received during the reporting period but not yet translated will be 
reflected in the next communication report to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur acted upon information received from reliable sources concerning 
individual cases of alleged breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of 
countering terrorism. In addition, he also took action with respect to legislative developments 
and proposals undertaken by a number of Member States. The Special Rapporteur recognizes 
that problems concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of countering 
terrorism are not only confined to the countries and territories mentioned.  
</p>
<p>5. In accordance with paragraph 2(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 6/28, the Special 
Rapporteur entered into a dialogue with several Member States on the preparation of legislation 
designed to combat terrorism. The Special Rapporteur, to the greatest possible extent, engaged 
with respective Governments during the drafting stage of the legislation. In the form of 
communications, press releases and consultations, the Special Rapporteur conveyed his main 
concerns to the Governments, some of which took the opportunity to reply, outlining their views 
and responding to specific questions posed by the Special Rapporteur. He regards this exchange 
as a positive and constructive dialogue resulting in a joint effort to draft and implement 
legislative frameworks that are equipped to successfully combat terrorism while at the same time 
aim at the effective promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. With a 
view to his mandate, including the reference to advisory services or technical assistance found in 
paragraph 2(a) of Resolution 6/28, the Special Rapporteur encourages more Member States to 
enter into dialogue, ideally during the preparatory stage of the adoption of new counter-terrorism 
legislation or legislation on terrorism-related offences. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">85. Thus, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, the definition as contained in the 2006 Law, in 
particular in conjunction with article 205.<footnote name="2">95. The Human Rights Committee noted its concern at the impact of the Decree on 
Government Administration in States of Emergency which imposes serious restrictions on media 
freedom (CCPR/CO/84/THA, para. 18). Due to their extensive scope of application, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that these provisions carry with them significant restrictions on 
fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to freedom of expression, association, assembly </footnote> of the Criminal Code, is overly broad and therefore at 
variance with Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
which enshrines the principle of legality in criminal law and implies that the requirement of 
criminal liability is limited to clear and precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the 
principle of certainty of the law and ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which would 
broaden the scope of the proscribed conduct.

<p><b>COMMUNICATIONS TRANSMITTED, REPLIES RECEIVED  
AND STATEMENTS MADE TO THE PRESS  
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>6. On 1 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent a communication regarding allegations they had 
received relating to <b>trials </b>taking place in Afghanistan<b> of detainees previously held in custody 
in the U.S. administered Bagram Theatre Internment Facility (BTIF), as well as detainees 
repatriated from Guant&#225;namo Bay Naval Base facilities to Afghanistan</b>.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>7. According to the information received, some of the individuals formerly detained by the 
United States Government at Guant&#225;namo Bay and Bagram have been, and continue to be, 
transferred to the Afghan National Detention Facility (ANDF) where they await prosecution. 
</p>
<p>8. This system of detention and transfer of detainees would seem to allow for prolonged 
detention in BTIF custody, and the prosecution and conviction of detainees without due 
consideration to legal requirements. Based on the information received, in the Special 
Rapporteurs&#8217; opinion, the system of detention and transfer of detainees fails to comply with fair 
trial international standards including the right to court review over any form of detention, the 
presumption of innocence, the right to defence and access to legal counsel, and the right to be 
tried without undue delay as laid down in Articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides, inter alia, that &#8220;anyone who is arrested shall 
be informed, at the time of the arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and should be promptly 
informed of any charges against him&#8221; and that &#8220;everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public 
hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law&#8221;. According to the 
information received, many detainees, prior transfer to the ANDF were under United States 
custody without charge for several years. In addition, to date, trials of ANDF detainees lack 
many basic due process of law guarantees, including access to a lawyer while under investigation 
and adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defence.  
</p>
<p>9. With respect to trials and the evidence before the prosecution, the information the Special 
Rapporteurs received suggests that the United States Government provides the Afghan 
prosecution team, that investigates national security cases, with supposedly general and 
declassified versions of the Detainee Assessment Branch Reports of Investigation (ROIs), which 
typically state the date of capture, the capturing force and the detainee&#8217;s alleged actions. These 
ROIs then form the basis of the Afghan Government&#8217;s prosecution charges. However, this is 
done without any examination of individual witnesses or statements in the court dossier&#8212;sworn 
or unsworn, often United States personnel or officials involved in the capture and/or 
interrogation of the detainee. To date an estimated number of 303 detainees have been 
transferred from United States custody to the Government of Afghanistan. The National 
Directorate for Security has investigated some 201 cases. The situation of the other 102 detainees 
is not clear regarding the grounds for their detention, and concerning some of them having been 
detained for several months. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">84. Furthermore, article 3, paragraph 2, of the 2006 Law, which defines &#8216;terrorist activity&#8217;, 
includes the &#8220;popularisation of terrorist ideas, dissemination of materials or information urging 
terrorist activities, substantiating or justifying the necessity of the exercise of such activity&#8221;, and 
also &#8220;informational or other assistance to planning, preparing or implementing an act of 
terrorism.&#8221; In light of article 205.<footnote name="2">94. The fifth concern relates to Section 9 of the Decree, which allows the Prime Minister to 
issue regulations to &#8220;prohibit any person from leaving a dwelling place during the prescribed 
period (&#8230;)&#8221;, &#8220;prohibit the assembly or gathering of persons at any place or any conduct which 
may incite or lead to unrest, &#8220;prohibit the publication, distribution or dissemination of letters, 
print materials or any means of communication containing texts which may instigate fear 
amongst the people or is intended to distort information (&#8230;)&#8221;.  
</footnote> of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation entitled 
&#8220;Public Appeals to Terrorist Activity or Public Justification of Terrorism&#8221;, punishable by 4 to 
8 years of imprisonment, the Special Rapporteur is concerned at the possible negative effect on 
freedom of expression. It should be noted that &#8216;public justification&#8217; is further detailed as a 
&#8220;public statement recognizing terrorist ideology and practices as deserving support and 
imitation&#8221;. However, as outlined above, this definition merely reflects one of the three 
above-mentioned conditions, i.e. condition no. 3.  
</footnote> 
  page 5 
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, it has been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteurs that the default 
status for these detainees transferred to the ANDF is that of pre-trial detention until a judicial 
decision regarding their cases are taken. The Special Rapporteurs are concerned over the 
potential negative effects of the prolonged pre charge detention in Guantanamo Bay and BITF 
that may compromise the ability of the Government of Afghanistan to ensure a fair trial for these 
persons. 
</p>
<p>11. Moreover, the trials are conducted based on the in-court reading of investigative 
summaries prepared by United States and Afghan officials which do not respect the principle of 
equality of the parties before the court. The use of evidence in this way and the fact that the 
convictions can be based on it, may violate international standards, including the prohibited use 
of evidence obtained under torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. The Afghan Constitution explicitly prohibits the introduction, as evidence, of 
statements obtained &#8220;by means of compulsion&#8221; and &#8220;recognizes a confession as voluntary only if 
taken before a judge&#8221;. The Special Rapporteurs urge the Government to assure full compliance 
with the Afghan criminal procedure code and international fair trial standards included in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the ICCPR, including by requiring in-court 
witness testimony, and by allowing the defendant to challenge the evidence through 
cross-examination. The Special Rapporteurs called on the Government to ensure that trials are 
conducted in accordance with international fair trial standards, as laid down in the UDHR and 
ICCPR. In this connection, the Special Rapporteurs express concern regarding the above 
mentioned issues and wish to refer to Articles 7, 25, 27(2), and 31 of the Afghan Constitution.

du Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial dat&#233;e du 26 juin 2006 (Voir A/HRC/4/26/Add.<footnote name="1">83. While commending the approach taken by the Russian Federation to define terrorist acts as 
a combination of means, as prescribed in article 3, paragraphs 2 and 3, together with the intent 
and the aim, both defined in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the same article, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed his preoccupation at the following: &#8216;Terrorism&#8217; is defined as &#8220;the ideology of violence 
and the practice of influencing the adoption of a decision by public authorities, local 
self-government bodies or international organizations connected with frightening the population 
and/or other forms of unlawful violent actions&#8221;. While this provision sets out the intent and aim 
as mentioned above, this definition, even read in conjunction with the defined terms of &#8216;terrorist 
activity&#8217; and &#8216;terrorist act&#8217;, does not meet the requirement of clear and precise provisions so as to 
respect the principle of legal certainty of the law.

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">82. Article 3 of the 2006 Law defines the terms &#8216;terrorism&#8217; (paragraph 1), &#8216;terrorist activity&#8217; 
(paragraph 2) and &#8216;terrorist act&#8217; (paragraph 3), which are prescribed in a complementary manner. 
In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, at the national level, the specificity of terrorist crimes is 
properly defined by the presence of three cumulative conditions. (1) The means used, which can 
be described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general population 
or segments of it, or the taking of hostages, (2) the intent, which is to cause fear among the 
population or the destruction of public order or to compel the government or an international 
organisation to doing or refraining from doing something and (3) the aim, which is to further an 
underlying political or ideological aim. It is only when all of these three conditions, or at least 
the two first ones, are fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. In particular, terrorism 
should not be defined through its political or ideological aims (condition no. 3), unless the two 
other conditions are also met. </footnote>

Juan Millal&#233;n Milla y Patricia Roxana Troncoso Robles dieron inicio a una huelga de 
hambre seca el pasado 10 de octubre de 2007. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, la huelga de hambre 
tendr&#237;a como objetivo, entre otros, denunciar la situaci&#243;n de los numerosos dirigentes y 
activistas mapuches condenados en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os a penas de prisi&#243;n por actos de

<p>El 8 de diciembre de 2007, un equipo m&#233;dico independiente habr&#237;a emitido un informe

encontraban en un estado de salud cr&#237;tico, indicando p&#233;rdidas de peso de entre 13.<footnote name="4">3. The Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government that the use of military courts to try 
civilians in most cases contravenes international law. In its General Comment No. 32 (2007), the 
Human Rights Committee underlined that article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Egypt is a party, requires that also trials by military court are in full 
conformity with the requirements of article 14 and that its guarantees cannot be limited or 
modified because of the military or special character of the court concerned. The Committee also 
notes that the trial of civilians in military or special courts may raise serious problems as far as 
the equitable, impartial and independent administration of justice is concerned. Therefore, it is 
important to take all necessary measures to ensure that such trials take place under conditions 
which genuinely afford the full guarantees stipulated in article 14. Trials of civilians by military 
or special courts should be exceptional, i.e. limited to cases where the State party can show that 
resorting to such trials is necessary and justified by objective and serious reasons, and where 
with regard to the specific class of individuals and offences at issue the regular civilian courts are 
unable to undertake the trials. </footnote> y

ante la extrema gravedad de su estado de salud.

<p>Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la Sra. Patricia Troncoso continuar&#237;a todav&#237;a en huelga 
de hambre. Seg&#250;n la revisi&#243;n del parte m&#233;dico independiente llevado a cabo el pasado 
30 de diciembre de 2007, la Sra. Troncoso habr&#237;a perdido m&#225;s de 23 Kg., presentando un 
cuadro cl&#237;nico que indicar&#237;a un serio riesgo vital.

85 d&#237;as del inicio de su huelga de hambre, en particular teniendo en cuenta su delicado 
estado de salud como resultado de las huelgas de hambre emprendidas con anterioridad.

condenados el 21 de agosto de 2004 a penas de 10 a&#241;os y un d&#237;a de prisi&#243;n por el supuesto 
delito de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221; en relaci&#243;n con el incendio del Fundo Poluco Pidenco, en 
aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley No. 18.<footnote name="314">. As the Government will recall, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 21 June 2006 (see 
A/HRC/4/26/Add.<footnote name="1">81. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view certain aspects of the laws require profound 
reconsideration in order to secure that their continued implementation will not lead to human 
rights violations.  
</footnote>, para. 63), he expressed concern at the extension of the length of detention 
without charge for up to 28 days for terrorist suspects. His main pre-occupation in this respect 
was that such period is too long unless there is regular judicial review of all aspects of the 
detention, including the reasons for it and any arguments the detainee may wish to present to 
contest them. In addition, the Special Rapporteur asked the Government to ensure that there is a

Article 349, para. 2, of the code of criminal procedure provides for the public prosecutor to 
authorize the judicial police to carry out coercive DNA tests by taking hair and saliva samples,

como ha se&#241;alado el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n de los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales en la lucha contra el terrorismo, toda definici&#243;n de 
terrorismo y de acto terrorista debe identificar de manera precisa dichas conductas, limitando su 
alcance solamente a aquellos actos que son terroristas por naturaleza (E/CN.4/2006/98, 
p&#225;rrs. 26-50). Ello asegura el pleno respeto al principio de legalidad consagrado en el art&#237;culo 15

and to 10 years of imprisonment for joining a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;. These sentences 
were the result of an unfair trial which based on a confession extracted through torture. 
However, the High People&#8217;s Court of Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) 
denied Mr. Dzhelil&#8217;s appeal, assessing that the facts were clear, and that the evidence was 
reliable and adequate. Allegedly, during the trial, the court-appointed lawyer did not make 
any statements on behalf of Mr. Dzhelil.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">49. Questions in respect of the Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007: The Terrorism 
Suppression Amendment Act 2007 (the Amendment Act) was enacted by the New Zealand 
Parliament in November 2007. It entered into force on 19 November 2007. Although the 
Amendment Act was enacted after the searches and arrests carried out in mid October 2007, the 
Bill which led to the Amendment Act was introduced into Parliament in December 2006 - and 
was unrelated to these events. The primary purpose of the Amendment Act was to ensure 
New Zealand&#8217;s compliance with its obligations under the United Nations Charter and the 
relevant Security Council resolutions on terrorism. It was also decided that some provisions had 
proved unworkable in practice or uncertain as to their effect and should be amended or repealed. 
In addition, provisions were included to enable New Zealand to ratify two new international 
anti-terrorism treaties, the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism and amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.

<p>29. In relation to Mr. Ismail Semed, an ethnic-Uighur (the subject of a previous joint 
communication, dated 13 April 2006) the Special Rapporteurs noted the Government&#8217;s reply of 
12 July 2006, where it was stated that the case is still under consideration. The Special 
Rapporteurs regret that no information was provided in relation to the allegations of torture, 
especially in light of recent information that Mr. Semed was executed on 8 February 2007, for 
offences of attempting to split the country and possession of firearms and explosives.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteurs referred the Government to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR). While the Government has not ratified this international human 
rights treaty, it has, through its signature, accepted the obligation, in the period between 
signature and ratification, acceptance or approval, to refrain in good faith from acts that would 
defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs referred to 
article 14 3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states: &#8220;In the 
determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following 
minimum guarantees, in full equality: (b) To have adequate time and facilities for the preparation 
of his defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing; (d) To be tried in his 
presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be 
informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned 
to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any 
such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteurs drew the Government&#8217;s attention to article 15 of the Convention 
against Torture provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>32. Please indicate on the basis of what criteria organizations are qualified as terrorist 
organizations and whether they can appeal against such qualifications. Please provide the 
relevant legal basis. 
</p>
<p>33. On 31 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, sent a communication regarding <b>the public execution of three men in Yengishahar, 
Xinjiang</b> <b>Province, </b>on 19 July 2008. They had been found guilty of being members of the 
East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an organization classified as terrorist by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>34. According to the information received, in January 2007, security forces arrested a group 
of 17 Uighur men, members of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), in Akto county, 
Xinjiang Province. The names of two of the men were <b>Mukhtar Setiwaldi </b>and <b>Abduweli Imin. 
</b>The men were subsequently charged with separatist activities, organizing and leading a terrorist 
organization, and the illegal production of explosives. At a trial held in November 2007 they 
were found guilty. Mukhtar Setiwaldi, Abduweli Imin<b> </b>and two or three other members of the 
group received death sentences, while the others were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Some 
reports indicate that two of the defendants were executed immediately after the trial. On 
9 July 2008, the local government authorities brought thousands of students and workers to a </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">48. Relevance of human rights standard: More broadly, the Note sets out a number of human 
rights standards in relation to compliance with human rights in measures taken against alleged 
terrorism and the promotion and protection of human rights generally. As will be evident, the 
consistency of the Police actions with human rights standards can be considered, and is currently 
being considered, by the New Zealand courts and several other independent institutions. If 
actions were found to have breached human rights standards, appropriate redress would be 
directed by the courts and other institutions. It is, again, not appropriate for the New Zealand 
Government to comment further on these matters while they remain under consideration by the 
courts and other institutions. 
</footnote>

</p>
<p>public square in Yengishahar. Three men were brought before the crowd, death sentences were 
read out (indicating that the men were among those arrested in Akto in January 2007) and then 
the three men were executed by a firing squad. Some reports maintain that Mukhtar Setiwaldi 
and Abduweli Imin were among those executed on 9 July 2008, while others state that they had 
already been executed in November 2007. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteurs fully recognize the Government&#8217;s right and duty to forcefully 
combat heinous acts of terrorism. Indeed, the very recent explosion of two buses in Kunming 
which reportedly killed two persons and might have been the result of a terrorist attack, 
reminded us (if at all necessary) of the urgency with which the Government needs to combat 
terrorist activities and protect the population. The Special Rapporteurs recall, however, that the 
fight against terrorism must be conducted within the framework of international law. In 
particular, they recall UN GA Resolution 60/158 of 28 February 2006, which in its paragraph 1, 
stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure to combat terrorism complies with their 
obligation under international law, in particular international human right, refugee and 
humanitarian law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>36. In this respect, the Special Rapporteurs recalled that the Human Rights Committee has 
observed that carrying out executions before the public is a practice that is &#8220;incompatible with 
human dignity&#8221;, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
observed that &#8220;[there is no legitimate interest served [...] by making executions public spectacles, 
and this is itself a most inhuman<b> </b>form of punishment.&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.<footnote name="3">72. Zhakhongir Yuldashevich Maksudov was found guilty and sentenced, under article 97, 
paragraph 2 (a) and (f), of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (&#8220;Aggravated 
premeditated killing of two or more persons in the course of mass public disorder&#8221;) to 10 years&#8217; 
deprivation of liberty, pursuant to article 57 of the Criminal Code, which provides for the 
mitigation of sentences; under article 155, paragraph 3 (a) and (b) of the Code (&#8220;Terrorism 
resulting in the death of a person and having other grievous consequences&#8221;), to 10 years, 
pursuant to article 57; under article 159, paragraph 3 (b) (&#8220;Crime against the constitutional order 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan committed by an organized group&#8221;), to 5 years; under article 161 
(&#8220;Sabotage&#8221;), to 10 years; under article 242, paragraph 2 (&#8220;Establishment, leadership or 
membership of an organized armed group&#8221;), to 10 years; under article 244 (&#8220;Organization of 
public disorder, accompanied by the use of force against persons, riotous behaviour and arson&#8221;), 
to 10 years; and under article 247, paragraph 3 (a) and (c) (&#8220;Unlawful acquisition by force of 
firearms, ammunition or explosive substances by an organized group with intent to rob&#8221;), to 
10 years. Pursuant to article 59 of the Criminal Code, which provides for the partial cumulation 
of sentences, he was finally sentenced to 11 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty to be served in 
general-regime penal colonies.  
</footnote>, para. 43). 
</p>
<p>37. According to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; information, public executions are also prohibited 
by Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. The Supreme 
Court, too, has to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; knowledge stated that public parading and other 
actions that humiliate the person being executed are forbidden. The Government informed the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that, &#8220;on 24 July 1986 and 
again on 1 June 1988, the ministries responsible for law, the People&#8217;s Procuratorates, public 
security and justice jointly issued a circular strictly forbidding the public display of condemned 
persons, and the pertinent authorities have since then treated this issue with the utmost gravity. In 
recent years, the phenomenon has thus been effectively prohibited&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38. Turning from the execution to the circumstances under which the death penalty was 
imposed, the Special Rapporteurs recalled that, although the death penalty is not prohibited 
under international law, it has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental 
right to life, and must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner.  
</p>
<p>39. In this respect, the Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government that in capital 
punishment cases, the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a 
fair trial admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right 
to have one&#8217;s conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher court. It is the understanding of the 
Special Rapporteurs that Chinese law now enshrines this guarantee, specifically providing that 
all death sentences have to be considered and confirmed by the Supreme Court. In the present 
case, reports do not clarify whether the three men executed on 9 July 2008 were able to exercise 
this right. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">47. Allegations of misconduct: Given the existence of current and proposed proceedings 
before the New Zealand courts and other authorities, it is inappropriate for the Government of 
New Zealand to comment at this stage upon the factual matters raised in the Note. These matters 
must be left to the independent determination of the courts and other authorities. 
</footnote> 
  page 13 
</p>
<p>40. Please indicate what measures your Excellency&#8217;s Government has taken or intends to take 
with regard to the apparent violation in this case of the prohibition of public executions. Please 
provide the exact wording of the provisions that form the legal basis for the arrest, detention, 
conviction and sentencing of the aforementioned persons. In particular, please explain how the 
notion of terrorism appears in the provisions in question, how it is defined and on what factual 
grounds all or some of the persons mentioned were considered to fall under the provisions in 
question.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>41. The Government sent a reply on 15 January 2008 to the correspondence of 3 October 2007. 
To his great embarrassment, the Special Rapporteur is still awaiting a translation of the contents 
of the Government&#8217;s response from the relevant Secretariat services.  
</p>
<p><b>Egypt 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>42. On 2 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent a communication regarding <b>forty members of the 
organization Muslim Brothers (&#1606;&#1608;&#1605;&#1604;&#1587;&#1605;&#1604;&#1575; &#1606;&#1575;&#1608;&#1582;&#1604;&#1573;&#1575; ) who, although they are civilians, are facing trial 
</b>before the Supreme Military Court in Heikstep, northeast of Cairo, on charges of terrorism and 
money laundering. The forty defendants face charges that could incur the death penalty. 
Reportedly, some of the defendants were acquitted in January 2007 by a civilian court in Cairo, 
but their case was referred to a military court through a Presidential Order. The military trial 
commenced on 26 April and has been adjourned on a number of occasions. It has been reported 
that authorities did not provide defence lawyers with details of the charges until the trial began 
and that observers have been repeatedly denied access to the court. Apparently, a criminal court 
in Cairo was to hear an appeal filed by some of these defendants against the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
decision to freeze their financial assets; the outcome of this appeal is not known. The military 
trial is still ongoing. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">46. Investigations into conduct of the investigation: Details of &#8220;any investigation and judicial 
or other inquiries into abuse of public authority which may have been carried out&#8217; and the results 
of those investigations. The Government of New Zealand notes that the actions of the Police in 
the investigation are currently the subject of proceedings before several independent bodies. The 
charges under the Arms Act against 16 of the 17 people arrested will be heard in court in due 
course. Those facing charges will be accorded all fair trial rights, in accordance with the 
New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, common law and international human rights standards. 
The hearing of the charges will involve careful scrutiny of the evidence of the activities alleged 
by the Police. It will be also be open to those charged to challenge the lawfulness (including the 
consistency with human rights standards, of the actions of Police in conducting the investigation, 
searches and arrests. The conduct of the investigation, searches and arrests in the Ruatoki area 
have been the subject of a claim for compensation and other redress by people said to have been 
unlawfully treated or otherwise adversely affected. Lawyers representing a number of such 
people have indicated that civil proceedings for compensation and other remedies will be filed in 
the courts in the near future. The claim may include claims under civil law and under the 
New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. In any case, these proceedings will, again, involve scrutiny of 
the lawfulness and reasonableness of the actions of the Police. The actions of the Police have 
also been the subject of claims or complaints to two independent official bodies. The 
Independent Police Conduct Authority is conducting an investigation into any misconduct or 
neglect of duty on the part of the Police, including in response to complaints made by lawyers 
acting for people in the Ruatoki area and by others. The Human Rights Commission has received </footnote> 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>44. Furthermore, the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal 
Assistance in Africa, adopted in 2003 by the African Commission on Human and People&#8217;s 
Rights, expressly prohibit the use of military courts to try civilians and stipulate that all civilians 
have a right not to be tried by such courts.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteurs referred to Principle 29 of the updated set of principles for the 
protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity, recommended by 
the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty first session, which states that &#8220;The jurisdiction of 
military tribunals must be restricted solely to specifically military offences committed by 
military personnel.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>46. Moreover, the Special Rapporteurs drew the attention of the Government to the fair trial 
guarantees that are being violated when civilians are brought before military courts. A key 
principle of international law is the right of every individual to a fair trial before a competent and 
independent tribunal, as stipulated in Article 14 of the ICCPR. Military court judges are 
appointed by the deputy head of the armed forces and, therefore, they cannot be seen to be 
independent and impartial. Following arrests, suspects in terrorism and other security-related 
cases are routinely held for periods of weeks or months in pre-trial detention during which they 
are denied access to legal counsel or direct contact with their families.  
</p>
<p>47. Since 1992, military courts have reportedly sentenced at least 94 people to death on 
terrorism-related charges. Of these, at least 67 are known to have been subsequently executed.  
</p>
<p>48. Please indicate whether the organization Muslim Brothers is qualified as terrorist 
organization and the legal basis of such designation. Please advise why these 40 persons are, as 
civilians, being tried before a military tribunal. Please identify the legal basis for the military 
tribunal&#8217;s jurisdiction over these individuals and how full compliance with international fair trial 
standards is in practice secured.  
</p>
<p>49. On 7 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government in 
response to Parliament&#8217;s approval on 28 May 2008 of the <b>extension of the state of emergency</b> 
for a further two years before its anticipated expiration on 31 May 2008. During his address to 
Parliament, Prime Minister Nazif informed Parliament that the emergency law would eventually 
be replaced since the Government still intends to produce a new counter-terrorism law and 
subject the bill to a public debate before its final adoption.  
50. The Special Rapporteur referred to a meeting with the Permanent Mission of Egypt 
on 12 December 2007 whereby he indicated that he could share with the Government his views 
on areas of concern that he often encounter when examining a State&#8217;s laws on countering 
terrorism. Since the Government is still deliberating a draft counter-terrorism law for future 
consideration, it is most timely that the Special Rapporteur can share four areas of concern 
regarding counter-terrorism legislation and its compatibility with international human rights law 
standards. 
</p>
<p>51. First, the definitions of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; or &#8220;terrorist act&#8221; as reflected either in general criminal 
law or in a specific act on counter-terrorism are often vaguely worded or have an overly broad 
application and therefore are at variance with Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR) which enshrines the principle of legality in criminal law and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">45. Application for consent to charges under the Terrorism Suppression Act: No charges have 
been laid under the TSA. As with a range of other offence provisions that may touch upon 
human rights, such as incitement of racial disharmony, charges under that Act require the 
consent of the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General&#8217;s role is to provide a constitutionally 
independent check upon such charges. The Police sought the consent of the Solicitor-General to 
prosecute 12 of the 17 arrested people for offences under the TSA. In a decision given on 
8 November, the Solicitor-General declined that consent stating: &#8220;... I am of the view that at this 
stage there is insufficient evidence to establish to the very high standard required that a group or 
entity was planning or preparing to commit a terrorist act as that term is defined in the 
legislation.&#8221; The Solicitor-General noted that the Police evidence had comprised hundreds of 
pages of intercepted communications and numerous photographs and video recordings. The 
Solicitor-General further observed in a public statement that the Police had had a proper and 
sufficient basis for the investigation under the TSA. 
</footnote> 
  page 15 
</p>
<p>implies that the requirement of criminal liability is limited to clear and precise provisions in the 
law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law and ensure that it is not subject to 
interpretation which would broaden the scope of the proscribed conduct. 
</p>
<p>52. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, at the national level, the specificity of terrorist crimes is 
properly defined by the presence of three cumulative conditions: (1) the means used, which can 
be described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general population 
or segments of it, or the taking of hostages; (2) the intent, which is to cause fear among the 
population or the destruction of public order or to compel the government or an international 
organisation to doing or refraining from doing something; and (3) the aim, which is to further an 
underlying political or ideological aim. It is only when these three conditions, or at least (1) and 
(2) are fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. In particular, terrorism should not be 
defined through its political or ideological aims (see condition (3) above), unless the two other 
conditions are also met. 
</p>
<p>53. The second area of concern often flows as a direct result of the issue outlined above 
regarding vague or broad definitions of terrorism due to a negative impact on other human rights 
protected under the ICCPR. For example, such negative impact may result in restrictions upon or 
violations of: Article 18 on freedom of thought, conscience and religion; Article 19 on freedom 
of expression; Article 21 which provides for the right to freedom of association; Article 22 on 
freedom of assembly; and Article 25 on the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs. 
The Special Rapporteur underlined the importance of these particular rights since terrorism 
should never be defined so broadly as to negatively impact on the peaceful methods used by civil 
society, including political and social activists. The rights listed here are often impacted either 
through broad definitions of terrorism or through separate provisions on associated crimes. 
Although the Special Rapporteur fully supports the criminalization of financing of terrorism or 
incitement to terrorism, he emphasizes that such provisions need to be carefully crafted because 
of the danger of targeting not only persons and entities supporting terrorism but also peaceful 
activity in society, possibly merely because of sharing some of the political aims a terrorist group 
purports to be furthering.   
</p>
<p>54. Third, in his interaction with Governments the Special Rapporteur often raised concerns 
regarding the detention of terrorism suspects. This is because many States feel tempted, in 
respect of terrorist crimes, to modify the generally applicable rules on detention. For instance, 
through increased maximum duration of police, pre-charge or pre-trial detention; through 
restrictions on the detainees right to choose and communicate with counsel; and in the field of 
securing effective judicial review of any form of detention. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
refers to Article 9 of the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p>55. Finally, with respect to prosecuting terrorist suspects, some States have chosen to bring 
these cases before ordinary courts. However, in some instances these cases are tried before 
military, special or specialized courts either routinely or on an exceptional basis, sometimes at 
the discretion of the Executive. In some countries, such special courts have even been &#8220;faceless&#8221; 
in the meaning of being composed of anonymous hooded military officers instead of trained 
judges. While the Special Rapporteur does appreciate the need to introduce some modification to 
ordinary court procedures in terrorism cases, inter alia to protect potential witnesses or other 
participants in the proceedings, in his interaction with governments he emphasizes the priority of </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">44. Questions in respect of the police investigation: This relates to an investigation by the 
New Zealand Police that was conducted over more than a year and that culminated in a series of 
searches and arrest over several days in mid-October 2007. The investigation related to the </footnote> 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>the principle of normalcy and remain mindful that a number of fair trial principles are often 
denied or severely undermined through departures from ordinary procedure so as to violate 
Article 14 of the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s invitation extended 
on 16 January 2009 to visit Egypt for the purposes of examining its counter terrorism law 
and practice. This visit is expected to take place from 16 to 21 April 2009.

<p><b>A.  Comunicaci&#243;n enviada al Gobierno por el Relator especial 
</b></p>
<p>57. El 1 de octubre de 2007, el Relator Especial se dirijo al Gobierno en relaci&#243;n con la 
informaci&#243;n que ha recibido relativa a <b>la Ley Especial contra actos de terrorismo, aprobada 
el 21 de septiembre de 2006 (Decreto No. 108)</b>, que determina las conductas terroristas y fija su 
penalidad, as&#237; como su implementaci&#243;n. Los siguientes aspectos de la Ley se preocupan al 
Relator Especial, especialmente:  
</p>
<p>58. La Ley Especial define en el art&#237;culo 1 su objeto, el cu&#225;l comprende aquellos delitos 
previstos en la misma, as&#237; como todas sus manifestaciones, incluido su financiamiento y 
actividades conexas que &#8220;por la forma de ejecuci&#243;n, medios y m&#233;todos empleados, evidencien la 
intenci&#243;n de provocar estados de alarma, temor o terror en la poblaci&#243;n, al poner en peligro 
inminente o afectar la vida o la integridad f&#237;sica o mental de las personas, bienes materiales de 
significativa consideraci&#243;n o importancia, el sistema democr&#225;tico o la seguridad del Estado o la 
paz internacional&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>59. El Relator Especial cree que dicha definici&#243;n es excesivamente amplia y vaga a la luz del 
principio de legalidad penal consagrado en el art&#237;culo 15 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos 
Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos. Dicho principio, inderogable incluso en caso de declararse el estado de 
excepci&#243;n, implica que la responsabilidad penal debe determinarse a trav&#233;s de disposiciones 
claras y precisas establecidas por la ley, a fin de respetar el principio de certeza jur&#237;dica y de 
asegurar que &#233;ste no quede sujeto a una interpretaci&#243;n que permita ampliar el &#225;mbito de la 
conducta penada.  
</p>
<p>60. El Relator Especial se gustar&#237;a expresar su preocupaci&#243;n por el lenguaje abierto de esta 
Ley y temo que durante su implementaci&#243;n se violen derechos humanos esenciales tales como el 
derecho de reuni&#243;n y asociaci&#243;n de los individuos. En este sentido, la interpretaci&#243;n actual de 
acto de terrorismo tuvo como consecuencia la detenci&#243;n provisional, el 7 de julio de 2007, de 
14 personas imput&#225;ndoseles el delito de &#8220;actos de terrorismo&#8221; en relaci&#243;n con actos de protesta 
social en reivindicaci&#243;n del &#8220;derecho al agua&#8221; acaecidos en la poblaci&#243;n de Suchitoto el 2 de 
julio de 2007.  
61. Como es del conocimiento del Gobierno, este suceso ha sido anteriormente objeto de 
preocupaci&#243;n y ha llevado a una comunicaci&#243;n dirigida al Gobierno por parte del Relator

Informales&#8221;) que, seg&#250;n fuentes, terminar&#237;a en disturbios contra los vendedores ambulantes de la 
capital. Unas 200 personas pasar&#237;an a integrar la lista negra de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil de 
sospechosos de terrorismo, la cual se distribuye, al menos, al FBI, a la base militar Comalapa y a 
la embajada estadounidense en la Colonia Santa Elena.  
63. Seg&#250;n informaciones recibidas, la Honorable Sala de lo Constitucional de la Corte 
Suprema de Justicia estar&#237;a &#8220;retrasando los procesos de inconstitucionalidad presentados por la 
ciudadan&#237;a en contra de la Ley contra actos de terrorismo&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>64. A este respecto, el Relator Especial quisiera llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno sobre el hecho 
de que, como ya ha se&#241;alado el Relator Especial anteriormente, toda definici&#243;n de terrorismo y 
de acto terrorista debe identificar de manera precisa dichas conductas, limitando su alcance 
solamente a aquellos actos que son terroristas por naturaleza (E/CN.4/2006/98, p&#225;rrafos. 26-50). 
Ello asegura el pleno respeto al principio de legalidad consagrado en el art&#237;culo 15 del Pacto de 
Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, as&#237; como en otros instrumentos internacionales de derechos 
humanos.  
</p>
<p>65. En su calidad de Relator Especial, el ha indicado que la resoluci&#243;n 1566 (2004) del 
Consejo de Seguridad insta a los Estados a que cooperen plenamente en la lucha contra el 
terrorismo y, de este modo, sancionan los actos que re&#250;nan estas tres caracter&#237;sticas de manera 
acumulativa: a) Actos, inclusive contra civiles, cometidos con la intenci&#243;n de causar la muerte o 
lesiones corporales graves o de tomar rehenes; y b) Actos cometidos, independientemente de 
toda justificaci&#243;n por consideraciones de &#237;ndole pol&#237;tica, filos&#243;fica, ideol&#243;gica, racial, &#233;tnica, 
religiosa u otra similar, con la intenci&#243;n de provocar un estado de terror en la poblaci&#243;n en 
general, en un grupo de personas o en determinada persona, intimidar a una poblaci&#243;n u obligar a 
un gobierno o a una organizaci&#243;n internacional a realizar un acto, o a abstenerse de realizarlo; y 
c) Actos que constituyan delitos definidos en las convenciones y los protocolos internacionales 
relativos al terrorismo y comprendidos en su &#225;mbito.

</p>
<p>67.  Otro aspecto de la Ley al que el Relator Especial gustar&#237;a hacer referencia en su calidad de 
Relator Especial es el relativo a las penas m&#225;ximas establecidas por delitos de terrorismo que 
llegan a constituir una cadena perpetua <i>de facto</i>, lo cual entrar&#237;a en contradicci&#243;n con lo 
dispuesto en el art&#237;culo 27, inciso segundo de la Constituci&#243;n de El Salvador. 
</p>
<p>68. El Relator Especial esta consciente de la necesidad de los Estados de adoptar medidas 
efectivas para prevenir el terrorismo y luchar contra &#233;l, pero a la vez, se preocupa que la 
legislaci&#243;n actual de terrorismo no sea plenamente conforme a los est&#225;ndares internacionales de 
derechos humanos. En consecuencia, el Relator Especial quiere hacer un llamamiento al 
Gobierno para que se impulse una reforma de la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista. 
</p>
<p>69. Es su Le ruego me facilite informaci&#243;n detallada sobre el n&#250;mero de casos en los que se 
haya aplicado la Ley Especial contra actos de terrorismo. &#191;Cu&#225;ntas personas han sido 
condenadas y cu&#225;les han sido sus sentencias? En la actualidad, &#191;cu&#225;ntos casos est&#225;n pendientes 
de juicio o de apelaci&#243;n? &#191;Pretende emprender el Gobierno de Su Excelencia medidas con el fin 
de definir clara y concisamente el terrorismo y los actos terroristas a trav&#233;s de la reforma de la 
Ley Especial o de otras leyes? Le ruego me proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada sobre las penas 
previstas en dicha Ley y sobre c&#243;mo el Gobierno de su Excelencia enfocar&#237;a el que dichas penas 
puedan llegar a constituir una cadena perpetua <i>de facto</i>, a la luz de lo dispuesto en la 
Constituci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>70. El 14 de enero de 2008, el Relator Especial ha mandado una segunda carta al Gobierno de 
El Salvador. 
</p>
<p>71. El Relator Especial ha escribido en relaci&#243;n a su carta de fecha 1 de octubre de 2007. En 
este sentido el Relator Especial quisiera se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno que ha recibido nueva 
informaci&#243;n sobre los hechos ocurridos en la ciudad de Suchitoto el 2 de julio de 2007, 
resultando en la detenci&#243;n de las se&#241;oras <b>Marta Lorena Araujo Mart&#237;nez, Rosa Mar&#237;a 
Centeno Valle, Mar&#237;a Haydee Chicas Sorto, Sandra Isabel Guatemala, Martha Yanira 
M&#233;ndez, Beatr&#237;z Eugenia Nuila Gonz&#225;lez, y los se&#241;ores Manuel Antonio Rodr&#237;guez 
Escalante, Facundo Dolores Garc&#237;a, Jos&#233; Ever Fuentes Herrera, H&#233;ctor Antonio Ventura 
Vasquez, Vicente V&#225;squez Basilio,  Clemente Guevara Batres, Santo No&#233; Manc&#237;a Ram&#237;rez 
y Gertrudis Patricio Valladares Aquino</b>. Es el conocimiento del Relator Especial que dichas 
personas ser&#225;n procesados el d&#237;a 8 de febrero de 2008.  
</p>
<p>72. A este respecto, el Relator Especial quisiera reiterar su preocupaci&#243;n sobre la Ley Especial 
contra actos de Terrorismo (LECAT), como lo ha expresado en su carta del 1 de octubre de 
2007. Una definici&#243;n de actos de terrorismo tan amplia y vaga, como en dicha ley, podr&#237;a dar 
lugar a graves violaciones de derechos humanos tales como la libertad de expresi&#243;n y la libertad 
de reuni&#243;n. Esto es muy preocupante si se toman en cuenta las penas establecidas en el 
art&#237;culo 5, LECAT, y el grave impacto que tienen sobre el derecho a la libertad de cualquier 
persona condenada. 
</p>
<p>73. Tambi&#233;n el Relator Especial desear&#237;a solicitar al Gobierno, que le facilite informaci&#243;n 
sobre el resultado del proceso de las personas arriba mencionadas y el Relator Especial esper&#243; 
que el juicio se lleve a cabo conforme a los est&#225;ndares internacionales del debido proceso 
judicial.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">32. The Special Rapporteur on Torture recalled that in his report A/60/31651, he stated that 
&#8220;diplomatic assurances are unreliable and ineffective in the protection against torture and 
ill-treatment: such assurances are sought usually from States where the practice of torture is 
systematic; post-return monitoring mechanisms have proven to be no guarantee against torture; 
diplomatic assurances are not legally binding, therefore they carry no legal effect and no 
accountability if breached; and the person whom the assurances aim to protect has no recourse if 
the assurances are violated. He is of the opinion that States cannot resort to diplomatic 
assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill-treatment where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or ill-treatment upon 
return&#8221; and called &#8220;on Governments to observe the principle of non-refoulement scrupulously 
and not expel any person to frontiers or territories where they might run the risk of human rights 
violations, regardless of whether they have officially been recognized as refugees&#8221;. (paras 51 
and 52).  </footnote>

</b></p>
<p>76. Le 30 juin 2008, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a re&#231;u une r&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
fran&#231;ais, relatif &#224; correspondance envoy&#233;e le 26 avril 2006 (voir A/HRC/4/26/Add.<footnote name="1">11. On 31 July 2008 the Permanent Mission of Israel in Geneva acknowledged receipt of the 
correspondence. As of 31 January 2009, there had been no response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
correspondence. </footnote>, 
paragraphe 22) intitul&#233;e : &#8216;&#8217;Observations de la chancellerie - demande de renseignements du 
rapporteur sp&#233;cial pour la promotion et la protection des droits de l'homme et des libert&#233;s 
fondamentales dans le cadre de la lutte contre le terrorisme.&#8217;&#8217; 
</p>
<p>77. Question 1 : Selon le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, certains actes de terrorisme contenus dans les 
articles 421-1 &#224; 421-2-3 du code p&#233;nal sont d&#233;finis trop largement ce qui pourrait laisser le 
champ libre &#224; des atteintes &#224; certains droits de l'Homme. Il souhaiterait, par cons&#233;quent, obtenir 
des informations sur les mesures qui permettraient &#8216;&#8217;d'assurer que la d&#233;finition des actes de 
terrorisme ne couvre que des actes qui sont terroristes par nature et qui atteignent un certain 
niveau de gravit&#233;, c'est &#224; dire ceux qui pr&#233;sentent un certain danger pour les personnes &#187;. La 
France s'est dot&#233;e progressivement d'une l&#233;gislation antiterroriste sp&#233;cifique dont la loi du 
9 septembre 1986 constitue la cl&#233; de vo&#251;te et qui a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;guli&#232;rement actualis&#233;e. Ce corpus 
l&#233;gislatif cr&#233;e un droit sp&#233;cialis&#233; et d&#233;rogatoire, comme il en existe en droit p&#233;nal &#233;conomique et 
financier ou en droit de la criminalit&#233; organis&#233;e, dans lequel le droit de la lutte anti-terroriste 
s'ins&#232;re aujourd'hui. La loi, et notamment l'article 421-1 du code p&#233;nal, d&#233;finit la notion d'acte de 
terrorisme par la r&#233;union de deux &#233;l&#233;ments: -l'existence d'un crime ou d'un d&#233;lit de droit commun 
incrimin&#233; par le code p&#233;nal. Les d&#233;lits sont &#233;num&#233;r&#233;s par une liste limitative &#233;tablie par le 
l&#233;gislateur &#224; l'article 421-1 du code p&#233;nal; -la relation de ces crimes ou d&#233;lits de droit commun 
limitativement &#233;num&#233;r&#233;s avec une entreprise individuelle ou collective ayant pour but de 
troubler gravement l'ordre public par l'intimidation ou la terreur, qui caract&#233;rise la circonstance 
de terrorisme. Ces actes de terrorisme sont punis de peines aggrav&#233;es, en raison de leur 
particuli&#232;re gravit&#233; (art. 421-3 et suivants du code p&#233;nal). Par ailleurs, se trouvent 
incrimin&#233;es sp&#233;cifiquement des infractions terroristes par nature ou pouvant en rev&#234;tir le 
caract&#232;re :  
</p>
<p>&#8226; l'acte de terrorisme &#233;cologique (art. 421-2 et 421-4 du code p&#233;nal) ; -l'association de 
malfaiteurs terroriste d&#233;lictuelle et criminelle (art. 421-2-1, 421-5 et 421-6 du code 
p&#233;nal) ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; la direction et l'organisation d'une association de malfaiteurs d&#233;lictuelle ou criminelle en 
vue de pr&#233;parer des actes terroristes (art. 421-5 alin&#233;a 2 du code p&#233;nal) ;  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.<footnote name="1">00. The above considerations highlight one reason why the imposition of the death sentence on 
charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; is so problematic. Reportedly this charge is directed mainly against 
political dissidents, critics of the Government and persons accused of espionage and might not be 
sufficiently well defined to satisfy the very strict standards of legality set by Article 6(2) ICCPR 
for the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty. In order for the sentence of death to be 
imposed &#8220;in accordance with the law&#8221;, the law in question must be sufficiently precise to clearly 
allow distinction between conduct punishable with the capital sentence and conduct not so 
punishable. </footnote> 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; l'acte de financement d'une entreprise terroriste (art. 421-2-2 du code p&#233;nal). En outre, 
est cr&#233;&#233; un dispositif de gel des avoirs et une peine compl&#233;mentaire de confiscation de  
l'ensemble des biens du d&#233;linquant terroriste et affectation du produit des 
condamnations au fonds de garantie des actes de terrorisme (art. 422-6 et 422-7 du code 
p&#233;nal) ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; la non justification de ressources de toute personne &#233;tant en relations habituelles avec 
une ou plusieurs personnes se livrant &#224; des actes de terrorisme (art. 421-2-3 du code 
p&#233;nal) ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; le recel d'auteurs d'un acte de terrorisme (art. 434-6 du code p&#233;nal).  
</p>
<p>Toutes ces infractions terroristes atteignent donc un certain niveau de gravit&#233; (d&#233;lits ou crimes) 
et pr&#233;sentent un certain danger, directement ou indirectement, pour les personnes qui en sont 
victimes. De plus, selon le rapporteur, l'article 421-2-3, qui punit le fait de ne pouvoir justifier de 
ressources correspondant &#224; son train de vie tout en &#233;tant en relation avec des personnes se livrant 
&#224; des actes qualifi&#233;s de terroristes, peut faire peser une pr&#233;somption de culpabilit&#233; et peut aboutir 
&#224; un renversement de la charge de la preuve. La condamnation du chef de ce d&#233;lit r&#233;sulte 
n&#233;cessairement de la d&#233;monstration, par l'accusation, d'une part, de liens avec des personnes se 
livrant &#224; des actes qualifi&#233;s de terroristes, et, d'autre part, d'un rapport &#171; d&#233;s&#233;quilibr&#233; &#187; entre des 
ressources d&#233;clar&#233;es et un train de vie. Pour ce faire, l'&#233;tude tant du niveau de vie apparent de la 
personne suspect&#233;e que de son patrimoine r&#233;el est d&#233;terminante pour d&#233;montrer le d&#233;s&#233;quilibre 
avec ses revenus officiels. S'agissant cependant d'une pr&#233;somption simple, le pr&#233;venu pourra 
rapporter la preuve contraire. Il convient de signaler que la chambre criminelle de la Cour de 
Cassation a estim&#233; que ne constituait pas un renversement de la charge de la preuve, et donc 
n'&#233;tait pas contraire aux dispositions de l'article 6 &#167; 2 de la Convention europ&#233;enne de 
sauvegarde des droits de l'homme, le fait de d&#233;duire la culpabilit&#233; d'une personne mise en cause 
sur le fondement de l'article 222-39-1 du code p&#233;nal (infraction jumelle du prox&#233;n&#233;tisme de la 
prostitution), de la circonstance que celle-ci se trouverait dans l'incapacit&#233; de justifier des 
ressources correspondant &#224; son train de vie (Crim., 26 septembre 2001). 
</p>
<p>78. Question 2 : Le Rapporteur souhaiterait recueillir des &#233;l&#233;ments sur l'interpr&#233;tation faite par 
les tribunaux du d&#233;lit d'apologie du terrorisme pr&#233;vu par l'article 24 alin&#233;a 6 de la loi sur la 
libert&#233; de la presse. Il voudrait notamment :  
</p>
<p>&#8226; savoir &#171; comment sont concili&#233;s &#187; ce d&#233;lit et la d&#233;finition large des actes de terrorisme ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; conna&#238;tre la distinction entre ce d&#233;lit et la provocation directe aux actes de terrorisme;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; savoir si la commission de ce d&#233;lit comprend un &#233;l&#233;ment intentionnel ainsi que la fa&#231;on 
dont se a caract&#233;riserait &#187; cet &#233;l&#233;ment intentionnel.  
</p>
<p>L'article 24 alin&#233;a 6 de la loi du 29 juillet 1881 dispose que sont punis de cinq ans 
d'emprisonnement et de 45.000 euros d'amende ceux qui auront provoqu&#233; directement des actes 
de terrorisme pr&#233;vus par le titre II du livre IV du code p&#233;nal, ou en auront fait l'apologie. Pour 
&#234;tre p&#233;nalement r&#233;pr&#233;hensible, la provocation &#224; la commission ou l'apologie d'actes de terrorisme 
doit &#234;tre effectu&#233;e par l'un des moyens &#233;nonc&#233;s &#224; l'article 23 de la loi du 29 juillet 1881 :  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 21 
</p>
<p>&#8226; soit par des discours, cris ou menaces prof&#233;r&#233;s dans des lieux ou r&#233;unions publics ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; soit par des &#233;crits, imprim&#233;s, dessins, gravures, peintures, embl&#232;mes, images ou tout 
autre support de l'&#233;crit, de la parole, ou de l'image vendus ou distribu&#233;s, mis en vente ou 
expos&#233;s dans des lieux ou r&#233;unions publics ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; soit par des placards ou des affiches expos&#233;es au regard du public ;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; soit par tout moyen de communication au public par voie &#233;lectronique.  
</p>
<p>La provocation directe doit &#234;tre interpr&#233;t&#233;e comme le fait de &#171; s'adresser &#224; la raison ou d'exciter 
les passions&#187; pour pousser &#224; la commission d'une ou plusieurs infractions bien d&#233;termin&#233;es. Il a 
ainsi &#233;t&#233; jug&#233; que ne correspondait pas &#224; cette d&#233;finition le texte ou le discours &#171; qui tendrait &#224; 
susciter non pas l'entreprise criminelle mais un mouvement d'opinion de nature &#224; cr&#233;er &#224; son tour 
un &#233;tat d'esprit susceptible de permettre la naissance de l'entreprise criminelle &#187;. Elle se distingue 
de la complicit&#233; par don, promesse, menace, ordre, abus d'autorit&#233; ou de pouvoir, d&#233;finie par 
l'article 121-7 du code p&#233;nal, en ce qu'elle se caract&#233;rise par un mode d'expression publique. 
L'apologie consiste &#224; d&#233;crire, pr&#233;senter ou commenter une infraction en invitant &#224; porter sur elle 
un jugement moral favorable. Elle se distingue de la provocation en ce qu'elle reste punissable 
m&#234;me quand l'auteur n'a pas d&#233;sir&#233; le renouvellement des infractions qu'il excuse ou justifie. 
L'apologie peut vanter une infraction dans l'abstrait, ou, dans une seconde forme plus souvent 
r&#233;prim&#233;e, s'appliquer &#224; des infractions effectivement consomm&#233;es. Les infractions de 
provocation et d'apologie d'actes de terrorisme se prescrivent dans le d&#233;lai de trois mois. Ces 
d&#233;lits ne sont en effet pas vis&#233;s par l'article 65-3 de la loi du 29 juillet 1881, introduit par la loi 
2004-204 du 9 mars 2004, qui a &#233;tendu &#224; un an la prescription applicables &#224; certaines infractions 
de presse. En application des articles 47 et suivants de la loi du 29 juillet 1881, la poursuite de 
ces d&#233;lits ne peut par ailleurs intervenir qu'&#224; la requ&#234;te du minist&#232;re public.  
</p>
<p>79. Question 3 : Les recommandations faites &#224; la France par le Comit&#233; des droits de l'Homme 
sur les proc&#233;dures p&#233;nales relatives &#224; la garde &#224; vue sont mises en avant par le Rapporteur 
Sp&#233;cial. Ce dernier voudrait conna&#238;tre les mesures qui sont envisag&#233;es pour les mettre en &#339;uvre 
et notamment : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; limiter au strict minimum le d&#233;lai de la garde &#224; vue et de la d&#233;tention provisoire ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; traduire dans le plus court d&#233;lai le pr&#233;venu devant un juge ; 
&#8226; rendre la traduction devant un juge obligatoire lorsqu'il est envisag&#233; de prolonger la 
</p>
<p>garde &#224; vue apr&#232;s 96 heures pour affaire de terrorisme ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; introduire un recours devant un tribunal afin que celui-ci statue sur la l&#233;galit&#233; de la 
d&#233;tention ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; garantir les droits des personnes gard&#233;es &#224; vue pour voir un m&#233;decin de leur choix, 
contacter un membre de leur famille puis avoir rapidement acc&#232;s &#224; un avocat et 
communiquer librement avec lui, sans limitation de temps.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>80. Concernant la garde &#224; vue : La loi du 23 janvier 2006 a introduit la possibilit&#233; d'une garde &#224; 
vue d'une dur&#233;e de six jours, soit 144 heures (prolongation de 24 heures renouvelable une fois en 
plus des 96 heures existantes), mais uniquement dans deux cas exceptionnels :-s'il existe un 
risque s&#233;rieux de l'imminence d'une action terroriste en France ou &#224; l'&#233;tranger ;-ou si les 
n&#233;cessit&#233;s de la coop&#233;ration internationale le requi&#232;rent imp&#233;rativement. Au 7 mai 2008, la garde 
&#224; vue de 6 jours n'a &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233;e qu'une seule fois, &#224; l'encontre d'une seule personne, pour les 
n&#233;cessit&#233;s de la coop&#233;ration internationale. Cela d&#233;montre que les magistrats en font un usage 
particuli&#232;rement exceptionnel. Lorsqu'il est envisag&#233; de prolonger la garde &#224; vue apr&#232;s 96 heures, 
l'article 706-88 alin&#233;a 7 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale rend la pr&#233;sentation devant le juge 
obligatoire. En effet, c'est le juge des libert&#233;s et de la d&#233;tention qui prolonge cette garde &#224; vue, 
par d&#233;cision &#233;crite et motiv&#233;e. Le gard&#233; &#224; vue peut alors s'entretenir avec un avocat &#224; compter de 
la 96&#232;me et de la 120&#232;me heure. Le 19 janvier 2006 (d&#233;cision n&#176; 2005-532 DC), le Conseil 
constitutionnel a statu&#233; sur cette loi &#171;relative &#224; la lutte contre le terrorisme et portant dispositions 
diverses relatives &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; et aux contr&#244;les frontaliers &#187; dont il avait &#233;t&#233; saisi par plus de

<p>81. Concernant le placement en d&#233;tention provisoire : titre exceptionnel, la d&#233;tention 
provisoire est ordonn&#233;e, en raison des n&#233;cessit&#233;s de l'instruction ou &#224; titre de mesure de s&#251;ret&#233;, si 
les obligations du contr&#244;le judiciaire se r&#233;v&#232;lent insuffisantes. Elle ne peut &#234;tre ordonn&#233;e ou 
prolong&#233;e que si la personne mise en examen encourt une peine criminelle, ou une peine 
correctionnelle d'une dur&#233;e &#233;gale ou sup&#233;rieure &#224; trois ans d'emprisonnement, ou enfin lorsque la 
personne en question se soustrait volontairement aux obligations du contr&#244;le judiciaire. Les 
motifs de placement en d&#233;tention provisoire sont limitativement &#233;num&#233;r&#233;s par l'article 144 du 
code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, modifi&#233; par la loi n&#176; 2007-291 du 5 mars 2007. Parmi ces motifs 
figure notamment la n&#233;cessit&#233; de mettre fin &#224; un trouble exceptionnel et persistant &#224; l'ordre 
public provoqu&#233; par la gravit&#233; de l'infraction, les circonstances de sa commission ou l'importance 
du pr&#233;judice qu'elle a caus&#233;, &#233;tant pr&#233;cis&#233; que ce trouble ne peut r&#233;sulter du seul retentissement 
m&#233;diatique de l'affaire. Aux termes de l'article 144-1 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, &#171; La 
d&#233;tention provisoire ne peut exc&#233;der une dur&#233;e raisonnable, au regard de la gravit&#233; des faits 
reproch&#233;s &#224; la personne mise en examen et de la complexit&#233; des investigations n&#233;cessaires &#224; la 
manifestation de la v&#233;rit&#233; (...) &#187;. En mati&#232;re correctionnelle la d&#233;tention provisoire ne peut 
exc&#233;der 4 mois si 1a personne n'a pas d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e pour crime ou d&#233;lit de droit commun 
soit &#224; une peine criminelle, soit &#224; une peine d'emprisonnement sans sursis d'une dur&#233;e sup&#233;rieure 
&#224; un an et lorsqu'elle encourt une peine inf&#233;rieure ou &#233;gale &#224; cinq ans. Dans les autres cas, &#224; titre 
exceptionnel, le juge des libert&#233;s et de la d&#233;tention peut d&#233;cider de prolonger la d&#233;tention 
provisoire pour une dur&#233;e qui ne peut exc&#233;der quatre mois par une ordonnance motiv&#233;e. Cette 
d&#233;cision peut &#234;tre renouvel&#233;e selon la m&#234;me proc&#233;dure, la dur&#233;e totale de la d&#233;tention ne pouvant 
exc&#233;der un an. Toutefois, cette dur&#233;e est port&#233;e &#224; deux ans lorsqu'un des faits constitutifs de 
l'infraction a &#233;t&#233; commis hors du territoire national ou lorsque la personne est poursuivie pour 
trafic de stup&#233;fiants, terrorisme, association de malfaiteurs, prox&#233;n&#233;tisme, extorsion de fonds ou </p>

</p>
<p>pour une infraction commise en bande organis&#233;e et qu'elle encourt une peine &#233;gale &#224; dix ans 
d'emprisonnement. En mati&#232;re criminelle, la personne mise en examen ne peut &#234;tre maintenue en 
d&#233;tention au-del&#224; d'un an. Toutefois, le juge des libert&#233;s et de la d&#233;tention peut prolonger la 
d&#233;tention pour une dur&#233;e qui ne peut &#234;tre sup&#233;rieure &#224; six mois par une ordonnance motiv&#233;e et 
rendue apr&#232;s un d&#233;bat contradictoire organis&#233;, l'avocat ayant &#233;t&#233; convoqu&#233;. Cette d&#233;cision peut 
&#234;tre renouvel&#233;e selon la m&#234;me proc&#233;dure. La personne mise en examen ne peut &#234;tre maintenue 
en d&#233;tention provisoire au-del&#224; de deux ans lorsque la peine encourue est inf&#233;rieure &#224; vingt ans 
de r&#233;clusion ou de d&#233;tention criminelles et au-del&#224; de trois ans dans les autres cas. Les d&#233;lais 
sont port&#233;s respectivement &#224; trois et quatre ans lorsque l'un des faits constitutifs de (infraction a 
&#233;t&#233; commis hors du territoire national. Le d&#233;lai est &#233;galement de quatre ans lorsque la personne 
est poursuivie pour plusieurs crimes mentionn&#233;s aux livres II et IV du code p&#233;nal, ou pour trafic 
de stup&#233;fiants, terrorisme, prox&#233;n&#233;tisme, extorsion de fonds ou pour un crime commis en bande 
organis&#233;e. A titre exceptionnel, lorsque les investigations du juge d'instruction doivent &#234;tre 
poursuivies et que la mise en libert&#233; de la personne mise en examen causerait pour la s&#233;curit&#233; des 
personnes et des biens un risque d'une particuli&#232;re gravit&#233;, la chambre de l'instruction peut 
prolonger pour une dur&#233;e de quatre mois (renouvelable une fois) les dur&#233;es pr&#233;vues &#224; 
l'article 145-2 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Le placement, et le renouvellement, d'une d&#233;tention 
provisoire est d&#233;cid&#233; par le juge des libert&#233;s et de la d&#233;tention &#224; l'issue d'un d&#233;bat contradictoire 
qui se d&#233;roule en audience publique. Le parquet d&#233;veloppe ses r&#233;quisitions, puis, le mis en 
examen et son avocat sont invit&#233;s &#224; prendre la parole. Le parquet peut s'opposer &#224; la publicit&#233; des 
d&#233;bats dans certains cas limitativement &#233;num&#233;r&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>82. Question 4 : Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial souhaite avoir des &#233;l&#233;ments d&#233;taill&#233;s sur 
l'enclenchement de &#171; la proc&#233;dure d'exception &#187; li&#233;e aux infractions sur le terrorisme 
notamment : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; l'autorit&#233; qui d&#233;termine s'il s'agit d'une affaire qui rel&#232;ve ou non des lois antiterroristes ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; les &#233;l&#233;ments dont cette autorit&#233; dispose pour d&#233;cider qu'une affaire rel&#232;ve des lois 
antiterroristes; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; l'&#233;ventuelle possibilit&#233; pour le gard&#233; &#224; vue de faire appel de cette d&#233;cision. 
</p>
<p>L'article 706-17 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale pose le principe d'une comp&#233;tence concurrente 
pour la poursuite, l'instruction et le jugement des infractions entrant dans le champ d'application 
de l'article 706-16 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale (actes de terrorisme). S'agissant de l'autorit&#233; qui 
d&#233;termine s'il s'agit d'une affaire qui rel&#232;ve ou non des lois antiterroristes, il s'agit de l'autorit&#233; 
judiciaire territorialement comp&#233;tente : c'est en effet apr&#232;s s'&#234;tre concert&#233; avec la section 
anti-terroriste que le parquet territorialement comp&#233;tent d&#233;cide de rester comp&#233;tent, ou de se 
dessaisir au profit des magistrats sp&#233;cialis&#233;s. La juridiction qui se dessaisit dispose, parmi les 
&#233;l&#233;ments qui motiveront sa d&#233;cision de dessaisissement, d'une circulaire et de sa connaissance 
des avantages pr&#233;sent&#233;s par la juridiction sp&#233;cialis&#233;e. La circulaire du 10 octobre 1986 indique 
qu'en r&#232;gle g&#233;n&#233;rale, il y aura lieu de centraliser &#224; Paris les affaires de terrorisme mettant en 
cause des organisations &#233;trang&#232;res et les affaires de terrorisme imputables &#224; des groupes qui 
agissent ou qui sont susceptibles d'agir en tout point du territoire national. La circulaire indique 
surtout que chaque affaire donnera lieu &#224; un examen particulier et qu'il conviendra de peser 
soigneusement les inconv&#233;nients d'une poursuite de l'enqu&#234;te ou de l'instruction &#224; Paris, </p>

</p>
<p>la gravit&#233; des faits pouvant &#224; elle seule d&#233;terminer ce choix. Les avantages de la centralisation 
parisienne sont susceptibles de d&#233;terminer le dessaisissement de la juridiction territorialement 
comp&#233;tente, en cas de comp&#233;tence concurrente : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Efficacit&#233; de la r&#233;pression : cette comp&#233;tence concurrente permet aux magistrats en 
charge de la lutte contre le terrorisme d'avoir une comp&#233;tence nationale et aux parquets 
locaux d'exercer des pouvoirs d'enqu&#234;te adapt&#233;s avant le dessaisissement concert&#233; au 
profit du parquet de Paris ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avantage d'une justice sereine et impartiale d&#233;tach&#233;e des pressions locales : le 
d&#233;paysement &#224; Paris d'affaires conf&#232;re plus de s&#233;r&#233;nit&#233; &#224; la justice. Ainsi, dans le cadre 
des placements en garde &#224; vue men&#233;es par les magistrats anti terroriste, le transfert des 
individus sur Paris permet d'&#233;viter la multiplication de manifestations locales ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Facilitation des recoupements, par des magistrats sp&#233;cialis&#233;s, entre les diff&#233;rentes 
proc&#233;dures : cette sp&#233;cialisation institu&#233;e par le l&#233;gislateur en 1986 pr&#233;sente l'avantage 
ind&#233;niable de centraliser les proc&#233;dures, permet le recoupement avec d'autres faits en 
lien et s'appuie sur une connaissance effective par les juges de la mati&#232;re. Ce dispositif 
de centralisation sert de r&#233;f&#233;rence dans les instances internationales et a &#233;t&#233; prolong&#233; par 
la loi du 23 janvier 2006 par la centralisation de l'ex&#233;cution des peines. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pratique des autorit&#233;s judiciaires parisiennes de se d&#233;placer fr&#233;quemment sur les lieux : 
les magistrats en charge de la lutte contre le terrorisme ont pour habitude de se d&#233;placer 
sur les lieux de commission des faits, pour y mener les actes d'enqu&#234;te mais &#233;galement 
pour rencontrer leurs coll&#232;gues locaux. 
</p>
<p>S'agissant de l'&#233;ventuelle possibilit&#233; pour le gard&#233; &#224; vue de faire appel de cette d&#233;cision, elle lui 
est offerte &#224; l'issue de la garde &#224; vue, &#224; l'occasion de sa mise en examen : en effet, pendant 
l'interrogatoire de premi&#232;re comparution, il pourra contester la qualification terroriste afin que le 
juge d'instruction s'estime incomp&#233;tent (article 706-19 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale), et si 
celui-ci s'estime comp&#233;tent, la personne mise en examen pourra contester la mise en examen et la 
qualification terroriste retenue en demandant l'annulation de sa mise en examen devant la 
chambre de l'instruction de la cour d'appel (article 80-1 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale). En cas de 
requalification par la cour d'appel en infraction de droit commun, la juridiction initialement 
saisie retrouvera sa comp&#233;tence. Enfin, lorsque les faits terroristes ne sont pas av&#233;r&#233;s, la section 
anti terroriste du parquet de Paris ou les magistrats instructeurs en charge de la lutte contre le 
terrorisme se dessaisissent au profit des juridictions locales initialement saisies. 
83. Question 5 :<b> </b>Le Rapporteur souhaite avoir l'avis du gouvernement sur la compatibilit&#233; des 
mesures sur le recours &#224; la vid&#233;osurveillance, les possibilit&#233;s de contr&#244;le des &#233;changes 
&#233;lectroniques et le traitement automatis&#233; de donn&#233;es &#224; caract&#232;re personnel avec le droit &#224; la vie 
priv&#233;e prot&#233;g&#233; notamment par l'article 17 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et 
politiques. A titre liminaire, il convient d'indiquer que cette question rel&#232;ve principalement de la 
comp&#233;tence du minist&#232;re de l'int&#233;rieur (DLPAJ). Selon les informations dont nous disposons, le 
minist&#232;re de l'int&#233;rieur envisagerait une modification du r&#233;gime juridique pour la 
vid&#233;osurveillance dans le projet de LOPSI (modification envisag&#233;e de la loi 95-73 du 21.01.<footnote name="9">9. Membership in a rebel armed group (classified as terrorist group by the Government) is 
often considered a serious offence. In interpreting Article 6(2) of the Covenant, however, the 
Human Rights Committee has consistently rejected the imposition of a death sentence for 
offences that do not result in the loss of life. As observed in a recent report to the Human Rights 
Council, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence 
of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the most serious crimes 
provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there 
was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (A/HRC/4/20, para. 53). Moreover, 
when the Human Rights Committee last considered a report presented by the Government, it 
expressly stated in its concluding observations that it &#8220;considers the imposition of [the death] 
penalty for crimes [...] that do not result in loss of life, as being contrary to the Covenant&#8221;

<p>84. Sur les interceptions judiciaires : Les interceptions judiciaires sont des moyens 
d'investigation ordonn&#233;s dans le cadre de proc&#233;dures judiciaires. Le secret des correspondances 
&#233;mises par voie des t&#233;l&#233;communications est garanti par la loi du 10 juillet 1991 et par 
l'article L32-3 du code des postes et communication &#233;lectronique. L'atteinte au secret de ces 
correspondances est sanctionn&#233;e par l'article 226-15 du code p&#233;nal. Les interceptions de 
communications sont donc des proc&#233;dures exceptionnelles permettant de d&#233;roger &#224; ce principe 
dans un cadre juridique clairement &#233;tabli : &#171; il ne peut &#234;tre port&#233; atteinte &#224; ce secret que par 
l'autorit&#233; publique, dans les seuls cas de n&#233;cessit&#233; d'int&#233;r&#234;t public pr&#233;vus par la loi et dans les 
limites fix&#233;es par celle-ci &#187; (article 1er de la loi du 10 juillet 1991). Les proc&#233;dures d&#233;velopp&#233;es &#224; 
l'origine pour encadrer les interceptions dans le domaine des t&#233;l&#233;communications fixes 
s'appliquent d&#233;sormais &#224; la t&#233;l&#233;phonie mobile ainsi qu'&#224; l'Internet. Les articles 100 &#224; 100-7 du 
code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale issus de la loi du 10 juillet 1991 pr&#233;voient d&#233;sormais que, pour les 
n&#233;cessit&#233;s de l'information, les interceptions sont possibles &#171; en mati&#232;re criminelle et en mati&#232;re 
correctionnelle, si la peine encourue est &#233;gale ou sup&#233;rieure &#224; deux ans d'emprisonnement &#187;. 
Dans ce cas, le juge d'instruction peut &#171; prescrire l'interception, l'enregistrement et la 
transcription de correspondances &#233;mises par la voie des t&#233;l&#233;communications&#187;, pour une dur&#233;e 
maximum de quatre mois, renouvelable. Toutefois, sa dur&#233;e est limit&#233;e &#224; deux mois 
renouvelables lorsqu'elle est ordonn&#233;e dans le cadre d'une enqu&#234;te suivie pour recherche des 
causes de la mort ou d'une disparition inqui&#233;tante (art. 80-4 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale). Il est &#224; 
noter que &#171; les enregistrements sont d&#233;truits, &#224; la diligence du procureur de la R&#233;publique ou du 
procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral, &#224; l'expiration du d&#233;lai de prescription de l'action publique. &#187;. Enfin, les 
capacit&#233;s d'interception pour ce qui concerne les &#171; lignes &#187; d'un d&#233;put&#233;, d'un s&#233;nateur ou d'un 
avocat sont encadr&#233;es plus strictement. La loi n&#176; 2004-204 du 9 mars 2004 a introduit un 
article 706-95 dans le code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale, autorisant l'interception des correspondances 
&#233;mises par voie de t&#233;l&#233;communications si les n&#233;cessit&#233;s de l'enqu&#234;te de flagrance ou de l'enqu&#234;te 
pr&#233;liminaire relative &#224; l'une des infractions entrant dans le champ d'application de l'article 706-73 
(criminalit&#233; et d&#233;linquance organis&#233;e) l'exigent. Le procureur de la R&#233;publique doit saisir le juge 
des libert&#233;s et de la d&#233;tention qui est le seul habilit&#233; &#224; donner l'autorisation pour la mise en place 
de la mesure. La d&#233;cision est accord&#233;e pour une dur&#233;e de 15 jours, renouvelable une fois dans les 
m&#234;mes conditions de temps et de dur&#233;e. Dans tous les cas, la d&#233;cision d'interception judiciaire 
doit &#234;tre &#233;crite, comporter tous les &#233;l&#233;ments d'identification et n'est pas susceptible de recours. 
L'interception judiciaire est plac&#233;e sous le contr&#244;le du magistrat qui l'ordonne. 
85. Sur le traitement automatis&#233; des donn&#233;es &#224; caract&#232;re personnel : 1. La loi n&#176;78-17 
du 6 janvier 1978 relative &#224; l'informatique, aux fichiers et aux libert&#233;s, et son d&#233;cret d'application 
n&#176;<footnote name="20">3. To ratify the above-mentioned international instruments, the Russian Federation had to 
transpose them into domestic criminal and criminal-procedure law and amend existing 
counterterrorism legislation. Accordingly, a new chapter 15.1 on &#8220;Confiscation of property&#8221; and 
article 205.<footnote name="2">93. The Special Rapporteur recalled that in General Comment 31, the Human Rights 
Committee noted that Article 2, paragraph 3, required that States Parties must ensure that 
individuals also have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate rights arising out of the 
covenant (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para. 15) and that States Parties must ensure that those 
responsible are brought to justice. Failure to do so could in and of itself give rise to a separate 
breach of the Covenant, especially regarding violations recognized as criminal under either 
domestic or international law, such as torture and similar cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment, summary and arbitrary killing and enforced disappearance as the problem of impunity 
for these violations, may well be an important contributing element in the recurrence of the 
violations (ibid, para. 18). The Special Rapporteur urged the Government to repeal this 
provision.

</p>
<p>&#8226; que les traitements sont soumis au contr&#244;le d'un magistrat; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; les personnes habilit&#233;es &#224; utiliser les traitements et &#224; obtenir communication des 
donn&#233;es personnelles y figurant; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; les modalit&#233;s d'exercice du droit d'acc&#232;s aux donn&#233;es personnelles par la personne 
figurant dans le traitement ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; le renvoi &#224; un d&#233;cret pour pr&#233;ciser les modalit&#233;s de mise en &#339;uvre des traitements 
(dur&#233;e de conservation des donn&#233;es par exemple). 
</p>
<p>En &#233;tant particuli&#232;rement attentif au maintien de l'&#233;quilibre indispensable entre respect de la vie 
priv&#233;e et sauvegarde de l'ordre public, la Chancellerie estime assurer la compatibilit&#233; entre le 
recours aux traitements automatis&#233;s des donn&#233;es &#224; caract&#232;re personnelles avec le droit &#224; la vie 
priv&#233;e prot&#233;g&#233;e notamment par l'article 17 du pacte international des droits civils et politiques. 
</p>
<p>2. Enfin, un projet de d&#233;cret relatif &#224; la conservation des donn&#233;es de nature &#224; permettre 
l'identification de toute personne physique ou morale ayant contribu&#233; &#224; la cr&#233;ation d'un contenu 
mis en ligne, qui devrait &#234;tre prochainement examin&#233; en section de l'int&#233;rieur du Conseil d'Etat, 
permettra de rendre applicables les dispositions de l'article 6, II et II bis, de la loi n&#176; 2004-575 du 
21 juin 2004 pour la confiance dans l'&#233;conomie num&#233;rique. En effet, la loi pr&#233;cit&#233;e pr&#233;voit que 
doivent faire l'objet d'un d&#233;cret en Conseil d'Etat, d'une part, la d&#233;termination des donn&#233;es que 
les prestataires techniques (fournisseurs d'acc&#232;s et d'h&#233;bergement Internet) doivent conserver 
pour permettre l'identification de toute personne physique ou morale ayant contribu&#233; &#224; la cr&#233;ation 
d'un contenu mis en ligne, et d'autre part, la fixation des modalit&#233;s d'application de l'article 6, II 
bis, de la loi pr&#233;cit&#233;e, notamment quant &#224; la proc&#233;dure de suivi des demandes administratives et 
aux conditions et dur&#233;e de conservation des donn&#233;es transmises aux autorit&#233;s administratives. Ce 
projet de d&#233;cret, qui encadre la conservation par les prestataires techniques des donn&#233;es utiles 
aux services r&#233;pressifs, garantira en outre un acc&#232;s de ces derniers &#224; des informations devenues 
indispensables &#224; l'aboutissement de nombre d'enqu&#234;tes p&#233;nales. En effet, suivant en cela une 
&#233;volution sociale plus g&#233;n&#233;rale, la d&#233;linquance conna&#238;t de profondes mutations en lien avec le 
d&#233;veloppement de nouvelles technologies. La conservation des donn&#233;es permettant 
l'identification des personnes physiques ou morales ayant contribu&#233; &#224; la cr&#233;ation de contenus mis 
en ligne, puis leur mise &#224; disposition des services et unit&#233;s de police judiciaire, permettront ainsi 
&#224; ces derniers de s'adapter aux nouveaux modes op&#233;ratoires employ&#233;s par les d&#233;linquants et 
criminels, et de mieux lutter contre ces derniers. S'agissant plus sp&#233;cifiquement de la lutte contre 
le terrorisme, il est d&#233;sormais solidement &#233;tabli que les terroristes ont fr&#233;quemment recours &#224; 
l'Internet pour leurs activit&#233;s, qu'il s'agisse de propagande, de communication et d'organisation 
logistique au sein d'un m&#234;me r&#233;seau ou encore de rep&#233;rage ou d'acquisition de modes 
op&#233;ratoires. Il est donc particuli&#232;rement n&#233;cessaire, dans un but pr&#233;ventif, de pouvoir acc&#233;der &#224; 
certaines donn&#233;es techniques associ&#233;es aux communications &#233;lectroniques dans la sph&#232;re de 
l'Internet. Le projet de d&#233;cret &#233;nonce donc une liste limitative des donn&#233;es que les prestataires 
techniques devront conserver. Il est en effet n&#233;cessaire que les fournisseurs et h&#233;bergeurs d'acc&#232;s 
Internet connaissent avec pr&#233;cision l'&#233;tendue de leurs obligations de conservation, afin de </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 27 
</p>
<p>pouvoir mettre en &#339;uvre les moyens n&#233;cessaires &#224; ces fins. Les donn&#233;es conserv&#233;es ne doivent 
porter que sur les personnes physiques ou morales ayant contribu&#233; &#224; la cr&#233;ation d'un contenu mis 
en ligne par un fournisseur ou un h&#233;bergeur d'acc&#232;s Internet, &#224; l'exclusion de toute information 
relative aux contenus eux-m&#234;mes. Enfin, le projet de d&#233;cret d&#233;finit les modalit&#233;s de d&#233;signation 
des agents sp&#233;cialement charg&#233;s de pr&#233;venir le terrorisme et pouvant mettre en couvre les 
dispositions l&#233;gislatives pr&#233;cit&#233;es dans le cadre des demandes administratives, ainsi que le 
dispositif proc&#233;dural correspondant mis en place. 
</p>
<p>86. Question 6 : Le Rapporteur voudrait avoir davantage d'informations sur la mise en &#339;uvre 
du syst&#232;me d'indemnisation des atteintes corporelles subies par les personnes victimes d'actes de 
terrorisme et du fonds de garantie des victimes des actes de terrorisme et autres infractions, 
notamment sur les actes couverts par &#171; la faute des victimes &#187; pouvant amener &#224; refuser ou &#224; 
r&#233;duire la r&#233;paration en application de l'article L 126-1 du code des assurances. Un r&#233;gime 
sp&#233;cifique d'indemnisation des victimes d'actes de terrorisme par le fonds de garantie des 
victimes d'actes de terrorisme et d'autres infractions (F.G.T.I.) a &#233;t&#233; mis en place par l'article 9 de 
la loi du 9 septembre 1986 relative &#224; la lutte contre le terrorisme et aux atteintes &#224; la s&#251;ret&#233; de 
l'Etat. Les victimes d'attentats commis sur le territoire fran&#231;ais, quelle que soit leur nationalit&#233;, 
peuvent b&#233;n&#233;ficier de l'indemnisation ; les citoyens fran&#231;ais ayant leur r&#233;sidence habituelle en 
France ou r&#233;sidant hors de France et r&#233;guli&#232;rement immatricul&#233;s aupr&#232;s des autorit&#233;s consulaires 
sont &#233;galement couverts lorsque les actes de terrorisme ont &#233;t&#233; commis &#224; l'&#233;tranger. D&#232;s la 
survenance d'un acte de terrorisme commis en France, le FGTI est inform&#233; de l'identit&#233; des 
victimes par le procureur de la R&#233;publique ; les autorit&#233;s diplomatiques et consulaires l'informent 
des attentats survenus &#224; l'&#233;tranger. L'indemnisation couvre l'int&#233;gralit&#233; des dommages corporels 
des personnes bless&#233;es et, pour les personnes d&#233;c&#233;d&#233;es, les pr&#233;judices moraux et &#233;conomiques 
des ayants droit y compris pour les ayants droit des victimes fran&#231;aises qui seraient, quant &#224; eux, 
de nationalit&#233; &#233;trang&#232;re tout en r&#233;sidant sur le territoire fran&#231;ais. Toute personne qui s'estime 
victime d'un acte de terrorisme peut directement adresser au F.G.T.I. une demande 
d'indemnisation. Les indemnit&#233;s sont r&#233;gl&#233;es par le F.G.T.I. en accord avec les victimes ; la 
proc&#233;dure est de nature transactionnelle. En cas de d&#233;saccord, la victime ou ses ayants-droit peut 
s'adresser au juge civil. L'indemnisation couvre l'int&#233;gralit&#233; des dommages corporels des 
personnes bless&#233;es et, pour les personnes d&#233;c&#233;d&#233;es, les pr&#233;judices moraux et &#233;conomiques des 
ayants droit. En application de l'article 20 de la loi n&#176; 2006-64 du 23 janvier 2006, les 
ayants-droit des victimes fran&#231;aises d'actes de terrorisme commis &#224; l'&#233;tranger sont indemnis&#233;s 
quelle que soit leur nationalit&#233; (article L.126-1 du code des assurances). Peut pr&#233;tendre &#224; une 
indemnisation par le FGTI, la victime d'un acte de terrorisme commis en France apr&#232;s le 
31 d&#233;cembre 1984. Le FGTI indemnise int&#233;gralement tous les pr&#233;judices subis par les victimes 
de terrorisme ind&#233;pendamment de la proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Toute personne qui s'estime victime d'un 
acte de terrorisme peut directement adresser au F.G.T.I. une demande d'indemnisation. Les 
indemnit&#233;s sont fix&#233;es et r&#233;gl&#233;es par le F.G.T.I. en accord avec les victimes ; la proc&#233;dure est de 
nature transactionnelle. La loi pr&#233;voit cependant que la r&#233;paration peut &#234;tre refus&#233;e ou son 
montant r&#233;duit &#224; raison de la faute de la victime. Jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent, cette disposition n'ont trouv&#233; &#224; 
s'appliquer que dans le cas d'un journaliste qui s'&#233;tait rendu en toute connaissance de cause dans 
un pays pr&#233;sentant des risques importants pour les personnes, et signal&#233; comme tel par le 
minist&#232;re des Affaires &#233;trang&#232;res. Par ailleurs, en application de l'article 26 de la loi du 
23 janvier 1990, les victimes d'actes de terrorisme commis depuis le 1er janvier 1982 b&#233;n&#233;ficient 
des droits et avantages accord&#233;s aux victimes civiles de guerre par le code des pensions militaires 
d'invalidit&#233; et des victimes de la guerre ; il s'agit notamment du droit &#224; pension de victime civile. 
Les victimes d'actes de terrorisme rel&#232;vent du minist&#232;re de la D&#233;fense et ont la qualit&#233; de </p>

<p>ressortissantes de l'Office National des Anciens Combattants (O.N.A.C.). Les victimes des actes 
de terrorisme commis entre 1982 et 1984 per&#231;oivent une rente militaire d'invalidit&#233;, seule 
indemnisation possible, puisque ces attentats ne rel&#232;vent pas de la comp&#233;tence du F.G.T.I. Aux 
avantages sociaux d&#233;coulant de cette l&#233;gislation peut, selon les cas, s'ajouter celui d'une 
majoration &#224; hauteur d'une demi-part, du quotient familial retenu dans le calcul de l'imp&#244;t sur le 
revenu (articles 195 et suivants du code g&#233;n&#233;ral des imp&#244;ts). Les victimes des actes de terrorisme 
commis apr&#232;s le 31 d&#233;cembre 1984, ne peuvent pas cumuler cette rente avec l&#8217;indemnisation 
vers&#233;e &#224; titre principal par le F.G.T.I. Enfin, il convient de mentionner que les successions des 
victimes d&#8217;actes de terrorisme sont exon&#233;r&#233;es d&#8217;imposition.

<p><b>Indonesia 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>87. On 22 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent a communication regarding three men found 
guilty of involvement in the 12 October 2002 bombings on the island of Bali, which killed 202 
people and injured a further 209: Mr. <b>Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim</b>, Mr. <b>Ali Ghufron</b> alias 
<b>Mukhlas</b>, and Mr. <b>Imam Samudera</b>.  
</p>
<p>88. On 3 May 2006, the Special Rapporteurs wrote to the Government regarding these cases 
(see A/HRC/4/26/Add.1, para. 26). In that communication, they &#8220;fully recognize[d] the 
Government&#8217;s right and duty to forcefully combat heinous acts of terrorism such as those the 
three above-named men have been found to be complicit in&#8221;. The Special Rapporteurs recalled, 
however, that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the framework of 
international law and expressed the concern that &#8220;it would appear that the death sentence against 
these individuals was not compatible with Article 6(2) and Article 15 of the ICCPR&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>89. The executions, which appeared to be imminent in May 2006, were in fact put on hold. 
However, in January 2008 police and court officials informed Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, 
Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera that their renewed demands for a second 
judicial review had been rejected. The three men appealed against this decision, but on 
17 July 2008, the Indonesian Supreme Court reportedly rejected this appeal and announced that 
they had exhausted their right of appeal, stating only one judicial review is permitted. 
90. The Special Rapporteurs&#8217; concerns were based on the apparently retroactive application of 
the law allowing the imposition of the death penalty against the three men. In their previous 
correspondence they wrote:  
</p>
<p>It is our understanding that on 18 October 2002, six days after the Bali bombing, 
President Megawati issued two &#8220;Government Regulations in lieu of law&#8221; (Peraturan 
Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang, or &#8220;Perpus&#8221;), Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002. 
Perpu 1/2002 provides that an act of terrorism, or the planning of or assisting in an act of 
terrorism, is punishable by death. Section 46 allows for its retroactive application if this is 
authorised by another Perpu or law. Perpu 2/2002 authorised that retroactive application 
&#8220;in relation to the [Bali] bombing incident&#8221;. Perpus 1/2002 and 2/2002 were subsequently 
approved by Parliament in March 2003 and converted into the Law on Combating </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 29 
</p>
<p>Criminal Acts of Terrorism 15/2003. We have further been informed that on 23 July 2004, 
the Constitutional Court has ruled that the retroactive application of Perpu 1/2002 
(i.e. Law 15/2003) violates Article 28I (1) of the Constitution and is therefore 
unconstitutional.  
</p>
<p>International law does not prohibit the death penalty per se as automatically violating the 
rights to life, but it mandates that it must be applied in the most restrictive manner. It is 
therefore crucial that all restrictions pertaining to capital punishment contained in 
international human rights law are fully respected in proceedings relating to capital 
offences. One such fundamental guarantee is that &#8220;the death penalty may be imposed only 
&#8230; in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime&#8221; 
(Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which 
Indonesia has become a party on 23 February 2006). This provision reinforces with regard 
to capital punishment the general principle that &#8220;[n]o one shall be held guilty of any 
criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal 
offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a 
heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time when the criminal 
offence was committed&#8221;. (Article 15 ICCPR). We note that this principle is also enshrined 
in the Constitution of Indonesia, which in Article 28I(1) provides that &#8220;the right not to be 
prosecuted under retrospective laws [is a] basic human right that may not be diminished 
under any circumstances at all&#8221;. All of these provisions, or at least their core, represent 
universal standards and customary international law. Moreover, Article 4(2) ICCPR 
provides that the right to life as enshrined in Article 6 and the protection against retroactive 
criminal legislation in Article 15 are among those rights that cannot be derogated from 
even &#8220;[i]n time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government not to proceed with their execution until 
all doubts in respect of the concerns raised have been dispelled. Please explain the grounds on 
which the Government intends to proceed with the execution of Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, 
Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Imam Samudera notwithstanding Article 28I(1) of the 
Constitution, the ruling of the Constitutional Court and your Government&#8217;s obligations under 
Articles 6(2) and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>92. On 17 October 2008, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence 
and advised that Mr Nurhasyim, Mr Ghufron and Mr Samudera were arrested, charged and 
convicted for their role in the bombing that took place on 12th of October 2002 on the island of 
Bali and which resulted in the death of 202 people, as well as injury to 209 Chers. Mr Nurhasyim 
was found guilty of various charges which included, among others, the purchase of a Mitsubishi 
minivan and bomb-making chemicals which were used in the Bali bombings. Following their 
much publicized trials, they were convicted as terrorists under the provisions of the Government 
Regulation on the Elimination of Terrorism and were sentenced to death by the Denpasar District 
Court in 2003. It is true that aforementioned Regulation (Perpu) was one of two presidential 
decrees passed in the aftermath of the bomb attacks. These two presidential decrees have since 
been turned into Law No. 1512003, also known as the Law on Combating Criminal Acts of 
Terrorism. This law imposes a death penalty in specific instances for convictions that have been </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>judged as falling under the legally established definition of &#8220;terrorist&#8221; arts. It also allowed for 
those involved in the bombings in Bali to be tried retroactively as well as granting powers to 
security authorities to deter and eradicate acts of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>93. The exact explanation for this decision is explained in greater detail below. Following the 
bombing, the then incumbent President, Megawati Soekarnoputri issued two Government 
Regulations in Lieu of Law (Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang), namely Perpu 
No. 112002 on the Eradication of Criminal Acts of Terrorism, and Perpu No. 212002 on the 
Eradication of Criminal Acts of Terrorism in Relation to the Bomb Explosion Incident in Bali, 
on 12 October 2002. It was argued by some quarters that these laws, especially Perpu 
No. 112002 which was the revised version of an anti-terrorism Bill which was previously 
debated by the DPR (the Indonesian Parliament). In fact, Article 46 of this Bill allowed for its 
retrospective application as long as it is authorised by another Perpu or law. The Perpu 
No. 212002 authorised this retrospective application in relation to the Bali bombing incident. 
These Regulations were subsequently approved by Parliament in March 2003 and were then 
converted, as already mentioned above, into Law on Combating Criminal Acts of Terrorism, 
i.e. Law No. 1512003. Subsequently, the retroactive application of the latter Law was challenged 
at the Constitutional Court level, which on 23 July 2004 had ruled that the retroactive application 
of the 2003 Law on Terrorism legislation violated Article 281(1) of the amended 1945 
Constitution, and was as a result, unconstitutional. In actual fart, according to the provisions of 
Article 22 of the 1945 Constitution, the President can in &#8220;the event of a compelling emergency&#8221;, 
issue with the delayed and subsequent consent of the DPR, a Perpu government regulation in lieu 
of law which has the power to take precedence over the rule of law or the opinions of the 
Constitutional court. In this case, the trials of the three men took place over the course of several 
years and finally, the judgment of the court was handed down on separate occasions between 
7 August 2003 and 2 October 2003. The three men refused to appeal or seek clemency as is their 
legal right under Indonesian law. On 14th of April 2006, the Attorney General&#8217;s office made it 
clear to them that this deliberate refusal to seek clemency meant that according to the norms of 
Indonesia law, they had exhausted all the legal remedies available to them and as a result, their 
execution was set to proceed. It should also be clearly noted that the families of the convicted 
defendants can also request a presidential pardon or a judicial review. The Attorney General also 
confirmed that although the relatives were made aware of their legal right to seek these options 
on behalf of the accused, rather, they had chosen to respect the request of the detainees and had 
waived their right to seek a pardon. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that the carnage and 
destructive loss of life caused by these men, who had so carefully and mercilessly plotted out and 
carried out this heinous act of terrorism led to unspeakable suffering and sorrow for the families 
and friends of the victims who today, survive them.  
</p>
<p>94. On the issue of retroactivity, since this dreadful tragedy and during the trial of those 
arrested for their involvement, there have been some questions raised on the validity of the law 
that was applied to convict these individuals. To this, it should be understood that while some of 
the laws may have had some retroactive effect, it should more importantly be recalled that in 
principle, as well as in actual application, the use of retroactive laws is often subject to 
exceptions. In certain cases, including in international law, they may be applied in cases of 
extraordinary or heinous crimes such as, but not excluding, terrorism. Indonesia wishes to recall 
to attention that as a signatory to the ICCPR which it ratified, does not believe that it is erroneous 
to apply to these terrorists, the provisions of its national law which imposes for such heinous </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 31 
</p>
<p>crimes, the death penalty. Indeed, it should be recalled that according to Article 15(2) of the 
ICCPR, there would be no prejudice for &#8220;...the trial and punishment of any person for any acts or 
omission which at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general 
principles of law recognised by the community of nations&#8221;. It is clear that because of the 
extraneous circumstances of the crimes committed, the government felt justified in applying a 
retroactive law which its Constitution legally allows it to impose. The various arguments relative 
to this matter have been considered in great detail and contrasted against potentially 
contradictory provisions of national legislation while at the same time realizing that the interests 
of national security were of greater importance. 
</p>
<p>95.  Furthermore, the government&#8217;s decision was not taken lightly given both international 
pressure following the terrorist attacks and the ensuing sensitivity it engendered for the different 
parties. In fact, the death penalty in Indonesia is not imposed arbitrarily or inevitably for crimes 
of a very serious nature. It must therefore be clear that although the law, as is the case with the 
provisions of international law relative to this matter, does not prohibit the death penalty, it is 
still not a sentence that is automatically or irrevocably imposed for similar crimes of this nature. 
The circumstances for its imposition always require a deliberate series of procedures to have 
been respected and a particular set of legal remedies to have been extinguished for its application 
to be considered definitive. In the case of the three above mentioned men, the crimes committed 
were indeed heinous, and the proof against them conclusive enough to exclude reasonable doubt, 
moreover, their deliberate failure to seek clemency or appeal - though they were clearly advised 
to do so by their legal counsel and the office of the Attorney General - indicates their 
unwillingness to utilize the legal resources at their disposal especially when informed of the 
relevance and the serious implications their consequent decisions would produce. It is therefore 
amiss to imply that derogations of this nature are not within the sovereign policy decisions of 
any nation that wishes to impose them as is clearly stipulated in the provisions of Article 6 (2) of 
the ICCPR. The Government takes this opportunity to renew its commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights, while at the same time, believes it is no less significant to ensure 
the respect of the norms that govern exceptional situations that threaten national security. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8217;s reply. Subsequently he has 
received updated information on this case confirming that Mr Amrozi bin H. Nurhasyim, 
Mr Ali Ghufron alias Mukhlas, and Mr Imam Samudera were executed by firing squad on 
8 November 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Iran 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>97. On 18 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, sent a communication regarding the death sentences reportedly imposed on three ethnic 
Kurds and alleged members of the armed group Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), 
<b>Farzad Kamangar</b> (also known as Siamand), <b>Ali Heydariyan</b> and <b>Farhad Vakili</b>. The 
Supreme Court of Iran is reported to have recently confirmed the death sentences and the 
execution of Farzad Kamangar might be imminent. According to the information received: </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili were arrested by Ministry of 
Intelligence officials in Tehran in July or August 2006. Farzad Kamangar was 
subsequently held incommunicado at a series of different locations, including in 
Kermanshah, Sanandaj and Tehran. In the course of his detention he was tortured, 
including by beating, flogging and electrocution. As a result of the treatment inflicted, he 
had to be transferred twice to prison clinics. 
</p>
<p>On 27 May 2007, the spokesperson of the Judiciary announced that Farzad Kamangar had 
been charged with membership in a terrorist organization and with holding explosives. In 
February 2008, the 36th Revolutionary Court in Tehran found Farzad Kamangar, 
Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili guilty on charges of &#8220;mohareb&#8221;, apparently in 
connection with their alleged membership in the PKK, and sentenced them to death. 
Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili were also found guilty of forging documents and 
sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which they have to serve before any execution being 
undertaken. 
</p>
<p>Reportedly the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences. It would appear from the 
information received, that the head of the Judiciary may already have issued the execution 
order for Farzad Kamangar.  
</p>
<p>98. Although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it has long been 
regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be applied in 
the most restrictive manner. Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which Iran is a party, provides that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty&#8221;, the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 33 
</p>
<p>101. Turning to the pre-trial detention of the three men, particularly Farzad Kamangar, the 
Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government that in capital punishment cases, the obligation of 
States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in Article 14 of the 
ICCPR admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these guarantees include the right to 
be assisted by a lawyer of one&#8217;s own choosing at all stages of the proceedings, to have adequate 
time and facilities to prepare one&#8217;s defence, and the right not to be compelled to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteurs recalled paragraph 6(c) of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 
of 2008 which urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result 
of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture 
as evidence that the statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this 
principle is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set 
forth, inter alia, in Article 7 of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>103. In this respect, the Special Rapporteurs drew the attention of the Government to 
paragraph 12 of General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which 
&#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect 
the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person;&#8221; Prolonged 
incommunicado detention furthermore negates the above-mentioned guarantees of the right to a 
fair trial, such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s 
defence.  
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights under international law of Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili 
are respected. Considering the irreversible nature of capital punishment, this can only mean 
suspension of the death sentence against the three men until the question whether the acts they 
were found guilty of satisfy international criteria for what constitutes &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; has 
been clarified, the allegations of torture have been thoroughly investigated and all doubts in this 
respect dispelled. 
</p>
<p>105. Please indicate the specific conduct Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili 
have been found guilty of and the legal basis of the death sentences imposed against them. Please 
indicate how these are compatible with international norms, specifically with the requirement in 
article 6(2) of the ICCPR, to which Iran is a party, that the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed 
only for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law&#8221;. To date, the query to provide the 
definition of &#8220;mohareb&#8221; under Iranian law, however, has unfortunately remained without a reply. 
Please provide details regarding access to legal counsel, public nature of hearings and judgments, 
the conviction and sentence, and the post-conviction proceedings in the cases of 
Farzad Kamangar, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili.

<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>107. On 28 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, as Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, sent a communication concerning Mr <b>Shawan Jabarin</b>, general director of <i>Al-Haq</i>, a 
Palestinian human rights organization based in the occupied West Bank. 
</p>
<p>108. According to information received, on 7 July 2008, the Israeli High Court rejected 
Mr Shawan Jabarin&#8217;s petition to have the travel restrictions against him lifted. Previous petitions 
filed by Mr Shawan Jabarin against the travel restrictions were rejected in December 2006 and 
June 2007. With the travel restrictions in place Mr Shawan Jabarin is not permitted to leave the 
West Bank. The High Court&#8217;s refusal to lift the travel restrictions against Mr Shawan Jabarin is 
reportedly based on secret information provided by the military and examined ex parte. This 
information allegedly justifies the Israeli High Court&#8217;s decision by proving that 
Mr Shawan Jabarin is a security risk. Given that neither Mr Shawan Jabarin nor his lawyer has 
been able to gain knowledge of why the travel restrictions are in place, it has been impossible to 
defend Mr Shawan Jabarin. Because he cannot leave the West Bank, Mr Shawan Jabarin has 
been unable to represent his organization at various events in other countries. 
</p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern that no reasons for the travel ban imposed 
against Mr Shawan Jabarin had been given and as a consequence he cannot effectively continue 
his non-violent activities in defence of human rights in the occupied West Bank territory. 
</p>
<p>110. The Special Rapporteurs referred the Government to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which has been ratified by Israel in 1991, which states in its article 14.1 that 
all persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal 
charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a 
fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. 
According to the jurisprudence by the Human Rights Committee fundamental principles of fair 
trial are already enshrined in the first sentence of article 14 and hence apply in any matter dealt 
with by the judiciary, not merely the consideration of a criminal charge or a suit at law. As 
equality of arms is one of those fundamental principles, the Special Rapporteurs are concerned 
that it may not have been respected in the case of Mr Shawan Jabarin. The court upholding his 
travel ban admitted secret evidence provided by one of the parties but not shared with the other 
party. Please provide information on how the right to a fair trial as established in international 
norms and standards is being respected in this case.

<p><b>Italy 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>112. On 20 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a communication concerning the case of Mr. <b>Sami Ben Khemais Essid</b> 
(hereafter, Mr. Essid), a Tunisian citizen, who was reportedly deported from Italy to Tunisia on 
3 June 2008 and held in Mornaguia prison outside the capital city of Tunis. According to the 
information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Essid had been scheduled to appear in a Milan courtroom on 3 June 2008, for a 
preliminary hearing on terrorism charges but an expulsion order was issued on 
31 May 2008 under the expedited procedure created by Law 155 of 31 July 2005. This 
law denies the right of suspensive appeal to those persons subject to removal on national 
security grounds. 
</p>
<p>Having been convicted in February 2002 of membership in a terrorist organization and 
sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison, Mr. Essid was indicted on new terrorism 
charges in 2005. He was remanded into pre-trial detention in June 2007 on the eve of his 
scheduled release from prison. It is reported that Mr. Essid had been held the maximum 
amount of time permitted in pre-trial detention for the charges against him and would have 
had to be released. However, according to our understanding, Italian law provides for the 
following alternatives to removal where such removal would violate international law: 
1) compulsory residence (obbligo di soggiorno) and 2) special police supervision. Such 
measures could have potentially been pursued, especially in light of the ongoing criminal 
prosecution against Mr. Essid. 
</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) communicated a request for interim 
measures in respect of Mr. Essid in March 2007, after he had alleged that his expulsion to 
Tunisia would expose him to treatment in violation of article 3 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights (ECHR).  
</p>
<p>113. In this context the Special Rapporteurs recalled that since 2006, the ECtHR has issued 
interim measures on behalf of a number of Tunisians who were sought to be expelled under the 
expedited procedure. In addition, the Grand Chamber of the European Court clearly established 
in its 2005 decision <i>Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey</i>, that a breach of interim measures 
constitutes a violation of the ECHR. This is in line with the practice of United Nations human 
rights treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the ECtHR&#8217;s recent decision in the case of <i>Saadi v. 
Italy</i>, whereby, the Court ruled on 28 February 2008, that Italy&#8217;s efforts to deport 
Mr. Nassim Saadi, a Tunisian national, would violate article 3 of the ECHR. Reportedly, after 
the Saadi ruling, the ECtHR recommended to the Government of Italy that in similar cases 
pending before the court, including that of Mr. Essid, it would be advisable to seek friendly 
settlements in those cases. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a communication on 17 October 2007 to the 
Government of Italy concerning Mr. Saadi. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteurs recalled that in May 2007, the Committee against Torture (CAT) 
issued its concluding observations on Italy&#8217;s fourth periodic report and expressed its concerns &#8220;at 
the immediate enforcement of these expulsion orders, without any judicial review,&#8221; and [&#8230;] 
&#8220;that this expulsion procedure lacks effective protection against refoulement&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern over Mr. Essid&#8217;s deportation in light of the 
interim measures communicated by the European Court of Human Rights; and particularly that 
Mr. Essid may have been expeditiously deported due to his likely imminent release from pre-trial 
detention.  
</p>
<p>117. In addition, the Special Rapporteurs drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the Convention 
Against Torture, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which similar to 
the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also prohibit torture 
and ill-treatment and provide that no person can be transferred to another country where he or 
she is at risk of torture and/or ill-treatment. This applies to all persons without consideration of 
their status or alleged crimes, and irrespective of the nature of the transfer, including extradition, 
expulsion, deportation and rendition. 
</p>
<p>118. Are there other individuals currently being held in Italy that face possible deportation who 
have their cases pending review by the ECHR and where the European Court of Human Rights 
has requested interim measures of protection? Is the Government monitoring the current legal 
status and treatment of Mr. Essid in Tunisia? 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>119. On 28 August 2008, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence, 
with the following information. The Italian Constitution of 1948 envisages the protection of 
rights and fundamental freedoms as contained in relevant international standards, such as the 
European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Universal Declaration 
on Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Italian legal 
system aims at ensuring an effective framework of guarantees, to fully and extensively protect 
fundamental rights, as enshrined, inter alia, in Art. 10 of the Italian Constitution, which sets 
forth: <i>(1) The legal system of Italy conforms to generally recognized principles of international 
law;</i> <i>(2) Legal regulation of the status of foreigners conforms to international rules and treaties;</i> 
<i>(3) Foreigners who are, in their own country, denied the enjoyment of those democratic 
freedoms as guaranteed by the Italian Constitution, are entitled to the right to asylum under 
those conditions provided by law;</i> <i>(4) Foreigners cannot be extradited for political offences.</i> 
Within this framework, Italy reiterates both the compliance with all relevant international 
standards, and the value of its Basic Law, to be considered of a mandatory nature and as 
guidance and basic criterion for the action, at all levels of the Italian Administration.  
</p>
<p>120. Mr. Essid Sami Ben Khemais was indicted as a member of a terrorist cell, active in Milan 
and in Lombardy, between the end of &#8216;90s and the year 2001. He was thus sentenced, by the 
Milan Tribunal, to a six-year and six-month detention penalty, on the ground of his membership 
to a criminal organization, aimed at terrorist activities. The pre-trial detention warrant was 
released by the preliminary investigation magistrate (acronym in Italian, <i>GIP</i>) at the Milan 
Tribunal. While Mr. Essid was serving the detention penalty, additional offences presumably 
committed by Mr. Essid, emerged further to the testimony by another member of the same </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 37 
</p>
<p>criminal cell. For these other offences, the <i>GIP </i>at the Milan Tribunal released, in June 2007, 
additional pre-trial detention warrants, affecting Mr. Essid and other individuals, within the 
framework of the investigation &#8220;4457/06- No. 179/07&#8221;. Since the time limit of the above pre-trial 
detention warrant was expiring and, thus, Mr. Essid was about to be freed, by enforcing Art.13 of 
Legislative Decree No.<footnote name="286">. The principle of legality in criminal law, enshrined in article 15 of the ICCPR and made 
non-derogable in times of public emergency, implies that the requirement of criminal liability is 
limited to clear and precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the 
law and ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the 
proscribed conduct. In my opinion, the above-mentioned provisions are overly broad and vague 
and at variance with Article 15 of the ICCPR, to which Thailand is a party. In addition, the 
Human rights Committee was concerned, in relation to the Decree, that it does not explicitly 
specify, or place sufficient limits, on the derogations from the rights protected by the Covenant 
that may be made in emergencies and does not guarantee full implementation of article 4 of the 
Covenant (CCPR/CO/84/THA, para. 13). </footnote>/98 and Art.<footnote name="3">71. Rasulzhon Raimdzhanovich Pirmatov was found guilty and sentenced, under article 97, 
paragraph 2 (a) and (f), of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (&#8220;Aggravated 
premeditated killing of two or more persons in the course of mass public disorder&#8221;) to 18 years&#8217; 
deprivation of liberty; under article 155, paragraph 3 (a) and (b), of the Code (&#8220;Terrorism 
resulting in the death of a person and having other grievous consequences&#8221;) to 17 years; under 
article 159, paragraph 3 (b), of the Code (&#8220;Crime against the constitutional order of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan committed by an organized group&#8221;) to 8 years; under article 161 of the </footnote> of Act No.155/2005, concerning the legislation on 
international terrorism, the Ministry of Justice issued an expulsion measure, justified by the risk 
that Mr. Essid, once released, might be able to facilitate terrorist activities within the Italian 
territory. Meanwhile, the Police HQs. Immigration Unit in Milan requested the Tribunal in Milan 
to release the authorization (<i>nulla osta</i>) to proceed with the expulsion. In this regard, it must be 
recalled that such authorization may be denied only on &#8220;the solely proceeding ground when there 
is the need to ascertain the liability of other members of relevant criminal organization or of 
those defendants, whose trial has been initiated&#8221;. Since this was not the case with Mr. Essid, the 
<i>GIP</i> at the Milan Tribunal released the requested authorization (<i>nulla osta</i>), on June 1, 2008. The 
repatriation of Mr. Essid took place on June 3, 2008. The Essid Sami Ben Khemais expulsion 
order was issued, in full compliance with the Italian legislation and international agreements, 
having it previously received the authorization (<i>nulla osta</i>) of the Italian magistrate, in contact 
with the Tunisian Authorities. The Tunisian Minister of Justice has recently affirmed publicly 
that Mr. Ben Khemais Essid was allowed to contact his defence counsel and that he would be 
tried publicly and fairly. The Italian News Agency, ANSA, reported on June 7th, 2008, that 
Ben Khemais Essid&#8217;s lawyer had affirmed to have visited his client and that his client enjoys his 
rights and has not been subjected to ill-treatment. With specific regard to your question 
concerning other similar situations, in accordance with Arts. 13, para.1, of Legislative Decree 
No.<footnote name="28">5. The second area of concern was the overly broad and vague definitions contained in the 
emergency decree, in particular those defining the powers granted to those allowed to take 
measures under the Decree. By way of example, Section 7 refers to &#8220;competent officials&#8221; to 
perform a range of duties under the Act, without defining them and Section 11 defines the 
additional powers granted under the Act in cases of &#8220;serious states of emergency&#8221; in a way 
which appears to provide unlimited powers to the Prime Minister, including to &#8220;issue a 
notification not to perform any act or to perform an act to the extent that this is necessary for 
maintaining the security of the State, the safety of the country or the safety of the people&#8221;.  
</footnote>6/98 and 3 of Act No.155/05, similar measures have been adopted by the Minister of 
Interior for other Tunisian citizens. Nevertheless the relevant measures have not been executed 
yet, further to the release of <i>ad interim</i> measures by the European Court of Human Rights. The 
Italian Authorities are effectively monitoring the situation of Mr. Essid. In particular, the Italian 
Embassy in Tunis is carefully and formally following this situation keeping in touch with their 
Tunisian counter-parts. Specifically, during a meeting in Tunis on July 24th 2008 the Tunisian 
Authorities stated that the detainee concerned has been allowed to meet his family (five times 
since the beginning of the detention), his defense counsel (four times since the beginning of the 
detention) and some physicians. Tunisian Authorities have committed themselves to providing 
relevant documentation/information and to pursuing the dialogue with all relevant interested 
parties.  
</p>
<p>121. With specific regard to the fight against terrorism, it is worth recalling that in the 
aftermath of September 11, 2001, the European Council, at its extraordinary meeting on 
21 September 2001, approved the &#8220;<i>Action Plan to fight terrorism</i>&#8221;. For the first time, the EU 
developed a coordinated, coherent and cross-pillar approach to all its policies and measures to 
fight terrorism. The European Council stated that &#8220;<i>terrorism is a challenge to the world and to 
Europe</i>&#8221;, and that its combat will become &#8220;<i>more than ever, a priority of the European Union</i>&#8221;. 
However the commitment to fight terrorism should go hand in hand with &#8220;<i>the respect for 
fundamental freedoms that are the basic foundation of our civilization</i>&#8221;. In particular, the 
&#8220;Action Plan to fight terrorism&#8221; envisaged the following priority areas: Enhanced Police and 
judicial cooperation, to be developed through means, such as the European Arrest Warrant, a 
Common List of Terrorists, and the Europol; the development of international legal instruments 
against terrorism; fighting the financing of terrorism; reinforcing aviation security; and a 
coordinated global action by the European Union. Within the EU framework, Italy reiterated its </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>firm commitment towards the prohibition of torture, the necessity to respect human rights, 
refugee law and international humanitarian law while countering terrorism, as highlighted in 
the 11th December 2006 EU Council Conclusions.  
</p>
<p>122. At the domestic level, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Italian Government urgently adopted 
Law Decree No. 374/01, entitled &#8220;Urgent Provisions in order to fight international terrorism&#8221;, 
which was confirmed by Act No. 438/01. By this Decree, the Government introduced into the 
Italian legal system the crime of &#8220;international terrorism&#8221; (see Art. 270 <i>bis</i> of criminal code). 
Art. 1 of Act No. 438/01 stipulates that &#8220;anyone, who promotes, sets up, organizes, directs or 
finances associations that intend to commit violent acts with the aim of terrorism or subversion 
of the democratic order, is punished with a detention penalty of up to seven years. Whoever 
participates in such associations is punished with a detention penalty of up to ten years. The 
terrorist aim emerges even when violent acts are directed against a foreign country, an 
international institution or organization&#8221;. At the substantial law level, the most important change 
brought about by the amendment of Art. 270 bis of the criminal code is the broadening of the 
scope of terrorism. Under Article 270, para. 3, of the criminal code, the scope of terrorism has 
been extended by including, on one hand, violent acts committed against a foreign State, 
international institution or organisation, while the repression of the planning of violent acts with 
the aim of terrorism is also included. It was also introduced an additional criminal offence 
concerning &#8220;assistance to associates&#8221;. Art. 270 of the criminal code provides for the detention 
penalty, up to four years to &#8220;whoever - excluding the case of participation in and abetting the 
crime &#8211; either shelters, or gives hospitality, or provides transport and communication means to 
those participating in the associations enlisted under Arts. 270 - 270 bis&#8221;. By Act No. 34/03, the 
Parliament amended Art. 280 bis concerning &#8220;acts of terrorism by use of explosive and deadly 
devices. In doing so, the list of offences concerning attacks with subversive and terrorist&#8217;s aim 
directed to damage personal property and assets was broadened.  
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 39 
</p>
<p>124. An aggravating circumstance is provided for when the suspected person gives false 
statements. The offence of using, possessing and making forged ID documents was introduced 
by Article 497 bis of the criminal code. With respect to said offence, the discretionary arrest in 
<i>flagrante delicto</i> is now provided for by Article 381, paragraph 2 of the code of criminal 
proceeding. The arrest in <i>flagrante delicto</i> is now mandatory also for terrorism offences and for 
offences committed with the intent to subvert the democratic order (Article 380, para. 2, letter i). 
Terrorism offences, including international terrorism, or offences committed with the intent to 
subvert the democratic order are now part of the offences, which are subject to police detention 
(Article 384, para. 1, of the code of criminal proceeding).  
</p>
<p>125. The detention of a suspected person on the initiative of the judicial police is provided for 
when specific elements are discovered, among which lies the possession of forged ID documents 
(as explicitly provided for by Article 384, para. 3, of the code of criminal proceeding). As to the 
procedural safeguards, in this context, it is worthy of mention that the Italian legal system aims 
at ensuring an effective framework of guarantees to protect human rights, by considering that the 
legal defence is an inalienable right (Please, see Arts. 97 &#8211; 98 of the criminal proceeding code in 
conjunction with Art. 24 of the Italian Constitution). More specifically, by Art. 98 of the criminal 
proceeding code, it is also envisaged the legal aid for the indigents. Also, by Presidential Decree 
No. 115/2002, the legal aid is ensured in the criminal field (Art. 74 ff.). To enjoy legal aid, 
neither specific conditions nor formalities are requested; a mere self-certification is sufficient, 
pursuant to Art. 79, para.1, letter c.  
</p>
<p>126. As to preventive measures, the arrest of individuals not caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> is re-
introduced when the obligations relating to special surveillance have been infringed (Article 9, 
para. 2 of Act No. 1423/1956). Article 1 bis of Act No. 431/2001 provides for any notification to 
be sent to the State Prosecutor for him/her to take any provisional measure in order to &#8220;freeze&#8221; 
property, to prevent property or resources available to terrorist organizations from being 
dissipated, concealed or used to finance terrorist actions. In doing so, the Law provides for the 
mandatory confiscation of the means and assets that are used or aim at committing the crime 
under reference. Article 270, paras. 4 and 5 of the criminal code provides for the offences of 
recruiting and training for terrorism purposes which are punishable with imprisonment up to 15 
and 10 years, respectively. Article 270, para. 6, of the code of criminal procedure provides for 
the offence of conduct for terrorism purposes and explicitly makes reference to the definitions 
provided for by agreements and provisions of international law. Police interrogations for 
investigation purposes, already prescribed for mafia-related offences (Act No. 356/1992), were 
introduced to also obtain from convicted persons information which could be useful to prevent 
and fight against offences committed for terrorism purposes, including with an international 
scope, or to subvert the democratic order (Article 18 bis of Act No. 354/1975 on the prison 
system).  
</p>
<p>127. On this issue, there have been various interventions by the Constitutional Court, to 
emphasize primarily that the Italian legal system aims at ensuring an effective framework of 
guarantees, so as to fully and extensively protect the fundamental rights of the individual (When 
an Italian legal provision apparently seems to affect the basic individual needs expectations, in 
reality we are facing a &#8220;<i>modus operandi</i>&#8221;, aimed at protecting fundamental rights, such as the 
right to life, safety, personal freedom and security, as well as national security and public order. 
This is somehow a method of &#8220;damage containing&#8221;: by which a higher requirement is protected </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>while other legitimate requirements of the individual may be temporarily compressed). More 
importantly, as to the constitutionality of the above measures, the Constitutional Court has 
emphasized, with regard to the terrorism threat, as follows: 1. The admissibility of provisions 
with a broad content vis-&#224;-vis cases conducive to offences of terrorism and subversion; 2. The 
superiority &#8220;of the careful and indefectible duty&#8221; of the legislative system as regards the 
democratic order and the public security against terrorism and subversion; 3. The admissibility 
of &#8220;ad hoc measures&#8221;, though with a specific deadline.  
</p>
<p>128. Within this framework, it is also worthy of mention that the provisions under Rule 39, as 
provided by the Rules of the Strasbourg Court, consist in an indication to the Government that it 
would be desirable, in the interest of the parties and of the procedure before the Court, not to 
proceed to the expulsion of the applicant. As per procedure, the Committee of Ministers is 
informed about the provision and the Chamber may invite the parties to supply it with any 
information on any matter relevant to the implementation of the temporary provisions of its 
indication. In this context, it must be reiterated that even before the <i>Mamatkulov </i>judgment in 
2005, when <i>ad interim</i> measures were considered not binding, Italy has always shown its full 
respect for the Court&#8217;s invitation and complied with Art. 44A concerning the obligation of loyal 
cooperation. The Court has started only very recently (in 2006) to count the number of the 
requested <i>ad interim</i> measures, either granted or rejected. To date, the Court has not published 
yet any report considering that situation per each State-party. At the procedural level, it is worth 
considering two cases: i. When the Court may promptly release the requested measure, <i>inaudita 
altera parte</i>, unless revoking it subsequently if following additional information, it deems that it 
was groundless (see the last case: <i>Beganov vs. Italy</i>); ii. When the Court may postpone the 
decision while, in the meantime, requesting the State concerned with additional information, 
with a view to eventually releasing that measure (in the latter case, within the lapse of time 
provided for to the Government to reply), there is not yet a formal compulsory precautionary 
measure. In the latter case, it should be noted that, with only one exception, Italy has always 
suspended the execution of the challenged measure, even prior to the formal release of the 
precautionary measure, within the lapse of time necessary to provide the Court with the 
additional requested information. The Italian Government wishes to reiterate that it is aware of 
the value of the precautionary measures. Along these lines, the Government reiterated and 
continues to reiterate its commitment to cooperating fully and loyally with the Court, within the 
European Convention framework, and with all the other relevant international and regional 
mechanisms.

</b></p>
<p>129. On 21 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers, sent a communication concerning 
<b>Mohammed Abdulmalik</b>, currently detained at the United States of America naval base of 
Guantanamo Bay (Cuba). According to the allegations received: 
</p>
<p>On 13 February 2007, Mr. Abdulmalik was apprehended by the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit 
in a caf&#233; in Mombasa, detained and held incommunicado in the Kilindini Port and Urban </p>

</p>
<p>Police Stations before being transferred to Hardy, Ongata and Spring Valley Police 
Stations in Nairobi. He was held on suspicion of the Paradise Hotel attack and the 
attempted attack on an Israeli Arkia Airlines plane in Mombasa in 2002.  
</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Abdulmalik was not charged with any offence, was denied the right 
to challenge his detention, denied access to a lawyer and contact with family members, and 
was not brought before a judge. On 26 March 2007, it was announced by the United States 
Government that Mr. Abdulmalik was transferred to Guantanamo Bay. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that no judicial proceedings were held in relation to the transfer of 
Mr. Abdulmalik from Kenyan to US custody.  
</p>
<p>130. The Special Rapporteurs drew the Government&#8217;s attention to article 3 of the Convention 
against Torture, which provides that no State party shall expel, return (<i>refouler</i>), or extradite a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would 
be in danger of being subjected to torture. In regard to article 7 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights the Special Rapporteurs refer to paragraph 9 of General Comment 20 
on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in 
which the Human Rights Committee states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the 
danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another 
country by way of extradition, expulsion or <i>refoulement</i>.&#8221;  
131. Furthermore, paragraph 6d of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 urges States not to 
expel, return (refouler), extradite or in any other way transfer a person to another State where 
there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected 
to torture and; the Council recognizes in this respect that diplomatic assurances, where used, do 
not release States from their obligations under international human rights, humanitarian and 
refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement. The Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering-terrorism, as cited from his report 
A/HRC/6/17/Add. 3, wishes to underline that &#8220;diplomatic assurances sought from a receiving 
State to the effect that a person will not be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment do not absolve the duty of the sending State to assess individually the existence of a 
&#8220;real risk&#8221;. (para. 17). 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1

</p>
<p>133. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs noted that most detainees currently held in 
Guant&#225;namo Bay have been there for several years without charges or trial, and without effective 
access to court or to a legal council for the determination of the lawfulness of their detention, 
that some of the Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees were expected to be tried by military commissions 
not meeting international fair trial standards, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Special Rapporteurs 
also noted that the United States wishes to return another group of detainees to their countries of 
origin or, where necessary, to a surrogate country. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights while countering-terrorism was advised that the U.S. Government is 
conducting negotiations with countries for this purpose. (A/HRC/6/17/Add.<footnote name="3">70. On 9 January 2008, the Government sent a letter to the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights in Geneva, in response to a previous communication jointly sent on 
21 October 2005 by the Special Rapporteur, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture (See E/CN.4/2006/98/Add.1, 
para. 26) regarding judgements pronounced by the Tashkent Regional Criminal Court 
on 13 August 2007.  
</footnote> para. 16). 
</p>
<p>134. Have measures been taken towards securing the accountability of the persons responsible 
for the transfer of Mr Abdulmalik to United States authorities What has the Government done in 
order to secure either the safe return or Mr Abdulmalik<b> </b>or his right to immediate juridical review 
of the lawfulness of his detention and his right to be tried without delay by an independent and 
impartial court? Will a remedy be offered to Mr Abdulmalik?

<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>140. On the 29 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a 
communication concerning <b>the arrest of 17 Maori social activists suspected of 
terrorism-related offenses</b>. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 15 October 2007, the police began a series of raids, home searches which resulted in 
the arrest of 17 Maori people as suspects of terrorism-related offenses in the cities of 
Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Palmerstan North, Hamilton, Whakatane and 
Ruatoki. The 17 individuals are described as social activists, members of the Maori 
organizations and other social and environmental support groups. It is reported that search 
warrants were obtained under the Summary Proceedings Act to search for evidence of the 
commission of offences against the Arms Act and the Terrorism Suppression Act. 
Information has been obtained that the police were searching for items &#8220;of which there is 
reasonable ground to believe will be evidence as to the commission of an offense of 
participating in a terrorist group, unlawful possession of firearms and unlawful possession 
of restricted weapons&#8221;. Initially, all but one of the 17 individuals were denied bail.  
</p>
<p>It is furthermore alleged that the police operations leading to the arrest of the 
17 individuals involved unnecessary disturbance of the life of one Maori community. 
According to the reports, blockades were set up by the police in the small township of 
Ruatoki, where all drivers and passengers were questioned by police officers. This also 
included the reported search of school buses of children on their way to pre-school by 
armed police officers. These disturbances, as well as the search of several homes, have led 
to the claim that the operations targeted the entire Maori community. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 45 
</p>
<p>According to article 67 paragraph 1 of the Terrorism Suppression Act, the consent of the 
Attorney-General is required to bring charges against any person for alleged offences 
against this Act. On 8 November 2007, the Solicitor-General, to whom this competence is 
currently delegated, announced that he could not authorise charges to be laid under the 
Terrorism Suppression Act since there was not sufficient evidence that a group or an entity 
was planning or preparing to carry out a terrorist act.  
</p>
<p>The police stated that these searches and arrests have been carried out in the interest of 
public safety. Investigations started in December 2005 when a camp was discovered in 
north eastern New Zealand where armed men were training. This camp and others were 
then put under surveillance. The police reportedly also intercepted telephone calls and 
monitored a number of computer accounts.  
</p>
<p>It is also in this context that the Special Rapporteurs have received information about the 
Government&#8217;s intention to amend the Terrorism Suppression Act. It is reported that the 
Government is particularly looking at broadening the definition of a terrorist act, reducing 
judicial oversight, allowing courts to consider classified information without giving it to 
defendants, and giving the Prime Minister sole responsibility for designating groups and 
individuals as terrorists. Information was also received that the third reading of the 
Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill was underway in the Parliament.  
</p>
<p>141. Concern was expressed that the arrests of the said 17 individuals may be connected to their 
activities in defence of the rights of Maori people, and particularly of the land rights of the 
Ngai Tuhone community, which has involved a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal regarding 
alleged taking by the Crown. Concern is further expressed that the planned amendments to the 
Terrorism Suppression Act, if adopted and implemented, would not be in accordance with 
international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>142. While the Special Rapporteurs referred the Government to existing international 
conventions and protocols on terrorist crimes, as well as Security Council resolution 1566 (2004) 
related to the characterization of acts of terrorism. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs draw 
the Government&#8217;s attention to the Global Counter-terrorism Strategy adopted by the 
General Assembly in resolution 60/288 and to General Assembly resolution 59/191, which 
stresses in its paragraph 1 that &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism 
complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, 
refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;, as do Security Council resolutions 1456 (2003) and 1624 (2005) 
in paragraphs 6 and 4 respectively. Please provide detailed substantive information about your 
Government&#8217;s intention to amend the Terrorism Suppression Act.

<p>alleged operation of training camps that included use of firearms and other weapons and related 
activities. The searches, which were conducted under judicially issued warrants, took place in 
Ruatoki, a rural area that is alleged to be the location of the camps, and in other locations 
throughout New Zealand, including Auckland, Palmerston North, Whakatane, Wellington and 
Christchurch. Seventeen people, a number of whom were Maori, were arrested. Sixteen of those 
arrested were initially remanded in custody, but have all now been conditionally released. 
Evidence obtained in the searches included firearms and other weapons. The searches and arrests 
were undertaken both under the Arms Act 1983, which concerns illegal use of firearms and other 
weapons, and under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 (TSA), which concerns terrorist acts. 
As a result of the investigation, 16 of the 17 people arrested have since been charged with 
offences under the Arms Act in relation to alleged illegal acts; involving firearms and other 
weapons.

<p>a number of complaints under the Human Rights Act 1993 alleging discrimination and other 
breaches of human rights standards and is able to conduct investigations and/or assist claimants 
in seeking to resolve the complaints. The complaints can, in turn, be pursued as civil proceedings 
for compensation and other redress before the Human Rights Review Tribunal. The conduct of 
each of these proceedings, including the further time that each will require, is a matter for the 
respective courts and other institutions and for the defendants and claimants concerned. 
Consistent with rights to fair trial and administrative fairness both under the New Zealand Bill of 
Rights Act and at common law, as well as New Zealand&#8217;s responsibilities under international 
law, each matter is being or will be conducted in a timely, robust and fair manner. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1

</p>
<p>entities under the TSA before those entities became subject to the provisions of the Act. Under 
the Amendment Act, individuals and entities on the UN terrorist list are automatically designated 
as terrorist entities under New Zealand law. The Amendment Act also provides for such 
designations to remain in force until such time as the individuals and entities are removed from 
the UN terrorist list. These changes were made to better reflect the mandatory nature of 
New Zealand&#8217;s legal obligations under the Security Council&#8217;s Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions 
regime and to remove the risk of inconsistency between New Zealand&#8217;s international obligations 
and the domestic legal regime. 
</p>
<p>151. High Court Extension of Designations: Prior to the passing of the Amendment Act, all 
final designations made under section 22 of the TSA, including designations of individuals and 
entities on the UN terrorist list lapsed automatically after three years unless extended by the High 
Court. Because a decision to designate under section 22 involves considerations of national 
security and national interest, it was considered that, subject to procedural safeguards, such 
decisions should be taken by the Executive rather than the Courts, whose role is better focussed 
on ensuring that the legal requirements of the designation and extension procedures are followed. 
Renewal through a court procedure also posed considerable evidential problems and risked 
New Zealand being in breach of its international legal obligations. Since New Zealand is obliged 
to maintain sanctions against those on the UN terrorist list until they are lifted by the Security 
Council, it was considered inappropriate for the TSA to include a renewal or review process for 
UN terrorist list designations. With respect to non UN list designations, the Amendment Act 
provides for s three-yearly review by the Prime Minister of these designations. In undertaking 
the review, the Prime Minister must apply the same test as for the original designation. Any 
decision made by the Prime Minister remains subject to judicial review. Furthermore, to ensure 
transparency in the exercise of the Prime Minister&#8217;s powers, a new section 35(3A) was added, 
which requires the Prime Minister report to the Intelligence and Security Committee on the 
renewal of any non UN list designation. 
</p>
<p>152. General Offence of Committing a Terrorist Act: The Amendment Act inserted a new 
offence of committing a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221;. The previous approach of relying on ordinary criminal 
offences was adequate where the relevant offence attracted a maximum penalty sufficient to 
meet the seriousness of the case. However, this may not always have been the case, thus the 
maximum penalty proposed in the Amendment Act for committing a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221; was set at 
imprisonment for life. The new offence provision relies on the existing definition of &#8220;terrorist 
act&#8221; set out in section 5 of the TSA. 
</p>
<p>153. Classified Information: No substantial amendments were made to the procedures for 
dealing with classified security information. The amendments streamlined the Act to provide for 
one procedure where classified information is involved, rather than two separate procedures 
depending on the type of proceeding brought by the applicant.

<p>judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a communication regarding <b>the imposition of the 
state of emergency by the President of Pakistan on 3 November 2007</b> and the suspension of 
fundamental freedoms, including the right not to be deprived of one&#8217;s liberty, save in accordance 
with the law and to the enjoyment of safeguards as to arrest and detention, the right to freedom 
of movement, the right to assemble in public and the freedom of expression. Further, the 
proclaimed state of emergency entails an attack on the independence of the judiciary. 
155. The State of Emergency declared by President Musharraf is said not to be a constitutional 
emergency envisaged in the Constitution, which has now been declared to remain in abeyance 
and replaced by a &#8220;Provisional Constitution Order&#8221;. According to the information received, 
seven members of the Supreme Court issued a declaration against the emergency rule order 
stating that it appears not to be legal, neither under the Constitution nor under international law. 
</p>
<p>156. In particular, the Special Rapporteurs are concerned about the situation of some 70 human 
rights defenders who were arrested during a meeting inside the premises of the NGO Human 
Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in Lahore. They were taken to the police initially, and 
requested to sign a declaration not to engage in any human rights activities. They all refused to 
sign it and were verbally abused by police officers.

158. All 55 human rights activists were produced before the Judicial Magistrate 
on 5 November 2007 and were sent to Kot Lakhpat Jail Lahore. A hearing took place 
on 6 November 2007 and these 55 activists have reportedly been released on bail.  
</p>
<p>159. The practising lawyer and United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, Ms <b>Asma Jahangir</b>, has been placed under house arrest for a period of 90 days, and her 
house has been declared a sub-jail where some of the activists mentioned above are currently 
detained. Two women defenders, Ms Shahtag Qizilbash and Ms Salima Hashmi, were shifted to 
a police owned residence at an unknown location. None of them have been charged. Neither a 
warrant nor a judicial order was issued. The activists have not had access to lawyers or to their 
families and were detained for several hours without receiving food. Concern is expressed at the </p>

</p>
<p>health of some of these leaders who are rather elderly. One of the detained activists, 
Mr. Ashtar Ausaf Ali advocate was sent to hospital after suffering a heart attack in police 
custody. 
</p>
<p>160. The Proclamation of emergency states that some members of the judiciary have 
undermined the executive and legislative branches in the fight against terrorism and extremism, 
thereby weakening the Government&#8217;s ability to address this grave threat. Immediately after the 
imposition of the State of emergency judges were required to take an oath of allegiance to the 
Provisional Constitutional Order to continue exercising their functions as judges. A high 
percentage of the judges refused to take the oath, as they refused to accept the state of emergency 
order, declaring it unconstitutional. In particular, only four out of the 17 judges of the Supreme 
Court took the oath. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was among those who did not 
accept taking the oath. All the judges of the Supreme Court who refused to take oath have been 
immediately replaced by new judges. They were not allowed to leave their homes and are 
prevented by Government forces from doing so. 
</p>
<p>161. Eight out of the 27 judges of the High Court of the Sindh Province took oath, while the 
other, including the Chief Judge, refused. In Balochistan, all five judges of the High Court 
accepted to take oath. In the Punjab Province, 17 out of the 31 judges of the High Court, 
including the Chief Judge, took oath. The most senior judge among those who refused to take 
oath, Mr <b>Bokhari</b>, is now under house arrest. In the North West Frontier Province, around 50% 
of the 17 judges have not taken oath. 
162. On 5 November 2007, lawyers protested against the declaration of the state of emergency. 
There are indications of extreme brutality in the repression by the police and extensive arrests of 
lawyers. Some 150 lawyers have been arrested in Karachi and 50 in Lahore, including 
Ms <b>Hifza Aziz</b> and Ms <b>Abid Saqi</b>. Lawyers have been attacked by the police also inside the 
Court and the bar premises. All office bearers of the Bar Associations were arrested.

<p>not genuinely terrorist in nature. As to proper characterization of terrorist acts in compliance 
with the requirement of legality, reference is made to existing international conventions against 
terrorism, as well as Security Council resolution 1566.   
</p>
<p>166. Information, as endorsed in E/CN.4/1996/39 of 1996, which provides that, in time of 
public emergency which threatens the life of the country and the existence of which is officially 
and lawfully proclaimed in accordance with both national and international law, a state may 
impose restrictions on freedom of expression and information but only to the extent strictly 
required by the exigencies of the situation and only when and for so long as they are not 
inconsistent with the government&#8217;s other obligations under international law. 
</p>
<p>167. Please state the legal basis of the aforementioned arrests and detention of the above 
mentioned persons, and how these measures are compatible with international norms and 
standards as contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders. Please provide an explanation as to the use of the notions &#8216;terrorism&#8217;, 
&#8216;terrorist&#8217; or &#8216;terrorist act&#8217; as a justification for the proclaimed state of emergency or any 
measures taken pursuant to it. How is it secured that any action to combat terrorism is strictly 
limited to acts that fall under international conventions against terrorism and the characteristics 
applied in Security Council resolution 1566?  
</p>
<p>168. On 14 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent a communication regarding the <b>Pakistan Army 
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2007</b>. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 10 November 2007, President Pervez Musharraf issued Ordinance No. LXVI amending 
the 1952 Army Act. This measure was taken in the context of the proclamation of a state of 
emergency by President Musharraf on 3 November this year. This amendment will 
broaden the scope of the Act for civilians to be tried and convicted by military tribunals. 
Previously, the Army Act contained provisions enabling the army to try civilians, but only 
if at least one of the accused belonged to the armed forces. Under the amended Army Act, 
the military courts will not have to honour the strict requirements of due process of law and 
the examination of evidence as under civil adjudication. Moreover, lawyers would only be 
allowed to represent the accused in the capacity of a &#8220;friend&#8221;. Furthermore, according to 
the ordinance, the amendment will have retroactive effect and include any of the above 
mentioned offences that have been committed since 1 January 2003. Government officials 
state that one of the reasons for the amendment to the Army Act is the inability of the 
existing anti-terrorism courts to hold proper or speedy trials of the people involved in acts 
of terrorism or armed militancy in the country.  
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1

</p>
<p>impartial tribunal, in accordance with article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads as follows: &#8220;Everyone is entitled 
in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the 
determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.&#8221; It should be 
noted that the trial of civilians in military courts may raise serious problems as far as the 
equitable, impartial and independent administration of justice is concerned.  
171. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs referred the Government to Principle 29 of the 
updated Set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to 
combat impunity, drafted by Ms. Diane Orentlicher, independent expert on this topic, and 
recommended by the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty first session, which states that 
&#8220;The jurisdiction of military tribunals must be restricted solely to specifically military offences 
committed by military personnel.&#8221; In its recent General Comment No. 32 on the right to fair trial 
under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights the Human Rights Committee has 
provided further clarification as to the international standards related to the jurisdiction of 
military courts over civilians. Despite of Pakistan not being a party to the Covenant, we believe 
that in particular paragraph 22 of the General Comment (CCPR/C/GC/32) provides relevant 
guidance.  
</p>
<p>172. Furthermore, with a view to the retroactive effect of the law and the availability of heavier 
penalties for military tribunals, the Special Rapporteurs would like to refer to Article 11 para. 2 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states: &#8220;No one shall be held guilty of any 
penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under 
national or international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be 
imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the penal offence was committed.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>173. With a view to the concerns expressed above, the Special Rapporteurs urged the 
Government to reconsider the Army (Amendment) Ordinance, 2007. The Special Rapporteurs 
believe this amendment could have a significant negative impact on human rights in the country.

un grupo marxista revolucionario. Si es declarada culpable, la Sra. Hinostroza podr&#237;a

</p>
<p>Seg&#250;n las informaciones, la presencia de la Sra. Hinostroza en el &#243;mnibus que transportaba 
a los ex-miembros del MRTA habr&#237;a sido circunstancial. Su participaci&#243;n en el congreso

Seg&#250;n la fuente, las autoridades no habr&#237;an todav&#237;a producido evidencias suficientes que 
involucren a la Sra. Hinostroza en supuestas actividades terroristas. La Sra. Hinostroza se 
encontrar&#237;a actualmente detenida en una prisi&#243;n de m&#225;xima seguridad. 
</p>
<p>El principio de legalidad en el derecho penal, establecido en varios instrumentos 
internacionales de  derechos humanos, tales como el art&#237;culo 15 del Pacto Internacional de 
Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos (PIDCP, del cual el Per&#250; es Parte,  implica que la 
responsabilidad criminal est&#233; limitada a provisiones claras y precisas en la ley, con el fin 
de respetar el principio de certeza de la ley y de asegurar que no se produzca una 
interpretaci&#243;n que aumente indebidamente el alcance de la conducta proscrita. 
</p>
<p>En conformidad con el Articulo 15 (1), nadie podr&#225; ser condenado por actos u omisiones 
que en el momento de cometerse no fueran considerados delitos seg&#250;n el derecho nacional 
o internacional. Tampoco se impondr&#225; pena m&#225;s grave que la aplicable en el momento de 
la comisi&#243;n del delito. Si con posterioridad a la comisi&#243;n del delito la ley dispone la 
imposici&#243;n de una pena m&#225;s leve, se aplicar&#225; &#233;sta.  
</p>
<p>Al nivel nacional, la especificidad de los delitos de terrorismo est&#225; propiamente definida 
por la presencia de tres condiciones acumulativas; (1) Los medios utilizados, que se 
pueden descritos como violencia letal o violencia seria contra los miembros de la 
poblaci&#243;n en general o contra segmentos de la poblaci&#243;n, o la toma de rehenes; (2) el 
prop&#243;sito, que es provocar temor entre la poblaci&#243;n o destruir el orden p&#250;blico u obligar al 
gobierno o a una organizaci&#243;n internacional a realizar, o a abstenerse de realizar, algo; y 
(3) el objetivo, que es avanzar hacia un objetivo pol&#237;tico o ideol&#243;gico subyacente. Un acto 
puede ser criminalizado como un acto de terrorismo &#250;nicamente cuando se cumplen las 
tres condiciones  mencionadas (ver E/CN.4/2006/98, p&#225;rrafo 50).

<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>180. On 14 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government 
regarding the &#8216;<b>Federal Law No. 35-FZ on counteraction against terrorism</b>&#8217;<b> </b>of 6 March 2006 
as amended on 27 July 2006 (henceforth 2006 Law)<b> and related provisions of the Criminal 
Code and the Criminal Procedure Code.</b> In this connection, the Special Rapporteur would like 
to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to four substantive areas that give rise to concern and one 
issue of particular interest in relation to provisions of the above-mentioned laws: 1) the definition 
of terrorism; 2) the legal regime of counter-terrorism operations; 3) the lawful infliction of 
damage against terrorist suspects; 4) trials <i>in absentia </i>of terrorist suspects; and 5) compensation 
and social rehabilitation of victims of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 55 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorist operation is determined at the discretion of the head of the federal executive 
body in charge of security or an official appointed by the former authority and solely accountable 
to this authority (article 12, paragraph 2, of the 2006 Law). Besides, accountability mechanisms 
such as by the legislature are completely lacking. 
</p>
<p>188. It should further be noted that article 56 of the Constitution provides for certain restrictions 
of rights and liberties in a state of emergency. The &#8216;Federal Constitutional Law on the State of 
Emergency&#8217; established a specific procedure of introducing the state of emergency which is 
subject to numerous restraints and controls. The counter-terrorist operation regime under the 
2006 Law imposes virtually the same restrictions und rights and freedoms as under a state of 
emergency, without, however, proclaiming it. Whereas the state of emergency may only be 
introduced for a short period, i.e. a maximum of 30 days in the entire country and a maximum of 
60 days in parts of the country, with any extension being subject to a complicated procedure, the 
2006 Law does not specify or limit the &#8220;period of conducting&#8221; of a counter-terrorist operation 
(article 11).  
</p>
<p>189. It follows from the above considerations that the provisions of the 2006 Law amount to a 
<i>de facto</i> state of emergency situation. In this context, the Special Rapporteur expressed his 
utmost concern at the blanket power vested in the executive body in charge of security. This 
cannot be mitigated by the fact that the 2006 Law, in article 2, paragraph 13, calls for the 
adequacy of measures applied with respect to the terrorist danger. In this connection, it should 
also be noted that the 2006 Law is lacking appropriate references to provisions of the Criminal 
Procedure Code with their safeguards involved.  
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 57 
</p>
<p>Particularly important, in this respect, would be a parliamentary control over the initiation and 
termination of a counter-terrorist action regime. Furthermore, the legislature should have a say 
with respect to the rights that may be derogated from and the safeguards that should accompany 
those derogations. 
</p>
<p>192. Article 22 of the 2006 Law prescribes that any infliction of damage against a person who 
has committed a terrorist action, which occurred in the course of suppressing a terrorist act, is 
lawful. Furthermore, article 18, paragraph 3, of the 2006 Law stipulates that no compensation 
should be granted for such damage. 
</p>
<p>193. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledged that the State has the duty and responsibility 
to take appropriate measures to prevent and counter terrorist acts, it should be noted that rights of 
a person who is suspected of having committed a terrorist act must not be entirely nullified. In 
light of the principle of the presumption of innocence, set out in article 49, paragraph 1, of the 
Constitution and article 14, paragraph 2, of the ICCPR, the State must not strip such person 
completely off his or her rights and freedoms. This right is protected at all times, as confirmed by 
Human Rights Committee in paragraph 16 of its General Comment 29 of 2001. 
</p>
<p>194. The provisions contained in articles 18 and 22 of the 2006 Law may lead to impunity for 
any violations of human rights of a suspected terrorist in counter-terrorism operation. For 
example, pursuant to article 22 of the 2006 Law in its current wording, cases of excessive use of 
force against a suspected terrorist would also be declared as lawful.  
</p>
<p>195. Article 247, paragraph 5, of the Criminal Procedure Code (introduced by the &#8216;Federal Law 
on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in connection with the 
Adoption of the Federal Law on the Ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the 
Prevention of Terrorism and the Federal Law No. 35-FZ on counteraction against terrorism&#8217;) 
allows &#8211; in exceptional cases &#8211; for aggravated crimes for the prosecution and trial <i>in absentia</i> if 
the defendant is outside the Russian Federation or in hiding, provided that the same case 
involving the same terrorist suspect is not tried by a foreign court. It should be noted that these 
provisions do not specify the term &#8220;exceptional&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>196. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur reminded the Government that trials <i>in absentia</i> 
appear problematic in respect of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, including the 
following constitutional provisions: article 23, paragraph 3 (principle of adversarity), article 24 
(right to acquaint oneself with materials affecting one&#8217;s rights and liberties), article 45 (right to 
self-defense) and article 47 (right to a jury-trial). This concern cannot be mitigated by the fact 
that article 247, paragraph 6, of the Criminal Procedure Code requires the mandatory presence of 
a defence counsel representing the defendant in such case. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that all laws are indeed in accordance with the 
Constitution. In fact, article 1 of the 2006 Law clearly states, &#8220;[t]he legal basis of counteraction 
against terrorism shall be the Constitution of the Russian Federation [&#8230;]&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p>198. In summary, while the Special Rapporteur reaffirmed that he is fully conscious of the need 
to take effective measures to prevent and counter terrorism, and of the difficulties of States in 
doing so, he is seriously concerned that the above-mentioned provisions of the 2006 Law and 
related provisions of the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code are not in accordance with 
international human rights standards. The Special Rapporteur urged the executive and legislative 
branches of government in the Russian Federation to consider and initiate amendments to the 
2006 Law and related provisions of the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in order to 
prevent human rights violations.   
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>199. On 21 April 2008 the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence 
regarding the provisions of Federal Counter-Terrorism Act No. 35-FZ of 6 March 2006, as 
amended on 27 July 2006.  
</p>
<p>200. The Special Rapporteur makes no allowance for certain particularities of Russian law in 
his enquiry. He categorizes Federal Counter-Terrorism Act No. 35-FZ of 6 March 2006, as 
amended on 27 July 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;<footnote name="2">92. While the Special Rapporteur welcomed the inclusion of the right for a victim to seek 
compensation, he is concerned that this provision provides blanket immunity from criminal, civil 
and administrative prosecution for authorities exercising powers under the emergency decree. 
The Human Rights Committee was also especially concerned that the Decree provides that 
officials enforcing the state of emergency to be exempt from legal and disciplinary actions, thus 
exacerbating the problem of impunity (CCPR/CO/84/THA, para. 13). The Special Rapporteur 
received information according to which this clause has effectively reinforced an existing status 
quo in which officials are not prosecuted for human rights violations.  
</footnote>006 Act&#8221;), as criminal and 
criminal-procedure legislation, extending the principle of legality in criminal law to it. He also 
asserts that the 2006 Act lacks appropriate references to the Code of Criminal Procedure of the 
Russian Federation and that the regulations governing counterterrorism operations in fact amount 
to measures taken in a state of emergency. He alleged that article 15 of the 1966 International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &#8220;enshrines the principle of legality in criminal law&#8221;, 
whereas the article actually pertains to the retroactivity of criminal law. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 59 
</p>
<p>Procedure (Participation of the defendant), pursuant to which serious or particularly serious 
crimes can - in exceptional cases - be tried in absentia where the defendant is outside the 
Russian Federation and/or fails to appear in court, provided that he or she has not been 
prosecuted on the territory of a foreign State for the same criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>204. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s one-sided approach to the matter in question can be seen in his 
analysis of the 2006 Act, which does not take into account the context to the above-mentioned 
Federal Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (Ratification) Act, 
Federal Act amending certain legislative acts of the Russian Federation in connection with the 
adoption of the Federal Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism 
(Ratification) Act, Federal Counter-Terrorism Act, Presidential decree No. 116 of 
15 February 2006 on counterterrorism measures and other laws and regulations which form the 
basis of domestic anti-terrorism law. 
</p>
<p>205. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s methodological errors prevent him from reaching conclusions of 
any real value to the Federal Assembly. Observations on the issues raised by the Special 
Rapporteur can be found below. 
</p>
<p>206. On the definition of terrorism. In dealing with such a complex phenomenon, the Federal 
Assembly has sensibly concluded that it is short-sighted to regard terrorism simply as isolated 
criminal acts, as was the case under Russian legislation until recently. As unlawful force - the 
use of which should be prevented whatever its purposes or social context - lies at the root of 
terrorism as a whole and terrorist acts in particular, the system of counterterrorism measures 
should focus on creating an effective mechanism for the relevant bodies&#8217; efforts to suppress 
manifestations of terrorism, but should not stop there. It should cover all areas of the efforts to 
counter terrorism and should target the initial, planning and execution stages of terrorism; in 
other words, it should suppress the use of unlawful force, related ideologies and the exponents of 
those ideologies. 
</p>
<p>207. This approach is based on United Nations Security Council resolution 1624 (2005), which 
first identified efforts to combat terrorist ideology and the advocacy and glorification of 
terrorism as fundamental tasks of international anti-terrorist cooperation. This approach was also 
taken into account by the Federal Assembly when drawing up the definition of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>208. The unlawful nature of the very ideology of terrorism is actually recognized by article 5 of 
the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, which defines &#8220;public 
provocation to commit a terrorist offence&#8221; as the distribution, or otherwise making available, of a 
message to the public, with the intent to incite the commission of a terrorist offence, where such 
conduct, whether or not directly advocating terrorist offences, causes a danger that one or more 
such offences may be committed. 
</p>
<p>209. On the regulations governing counterterrorism operations. The regulations governing 
counterterrorism operations (but not the regulations governing states of emergency, with which 
the Special Rapporteur confuses them) are lawful by virtue of the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The provisions of article 29, part 2, of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
article 4 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Civil and Political Rights; 
article 12, part 3, article 18, part 3, article 19, part 3, and article 21 of the 1966 </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; article 15 of the 1950 Convention 
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; article 2, part 3, of 
Protocol No. 4 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms; article 13 of the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of 
Terrorism; and article 55, part 3, of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which 
stipulate that restrictions can be placed on the rights and freedoms of the individual and 
the citizen by means of federal laws only to the extent necessary to protect the 
foundations of the constitutional order and the morals, health and rights and lawful 
interests of other persons, and to defend the country and State security. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The rules and regulations established on the basis of the above and relating to the 
national borders of the Russian Federation in the territorial entities to which access is 
restricted, as well as epidemiological, public health, veterinary and other arrangements 
under administrative law which provide for the restriction of human rights and 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The principle of the indivisibility and interdependence of economic, social, cultural, 
civil and political rights embodied in United Nations General Assembly 
resolution 41/117 of 4 December 1986 and reflected in the position of the Constitutional 
Court of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Constitutional Court decision No. 10-P of 31 July 1995 on the constitutionality of 
Presidential decree No. 2137 of 30 November 1994 concerning arrangements for 
restoring constitutional legality and the rule of law in the Chechen Republic and of other 
laws and regulations, in which it is indicated that: (1) it does not follow from the 
Constitution that national integrity and constitutional order in extraordinary situations 
may be ensured solely by imposing a state of emergency or martial law (paragraph 4 of 
the preamble to the decision); (2) the provisions of article 55, part 3, and article 56 of 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation require systemic interpretation (paragraph 3 
of the operative part of the decision). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The fact that the regulations governing the counterterrorism operation zone were first 
established as separate arrangements by the 1998 Federal Act to combat terrorism and 
confirmed by the 2006 Counter-Terrorism Act. 
</p>
<p>210. Also of note is Constitutional Court ruling No. 195-O of 13 June 2006, declining to hear a 
complaint from the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation that the 
constitutional rights of Mr. Konstantin Aleksandrovich Ivukov had been violated by article 3.9, 
part 2, of the Code of Administrative Offences. In the ruling, which was handed down after the 
2006 Act had been adopted, the Court confirmed that the application of administrative detention 
for violations of the regulations governing a state of emergency or a counter-terrorist operations 
zone does not breach article 22, part 2, of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>211. On the lawful infliction of damage. Under article 29, part 2, of the 1948 Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, in the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be 
subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due 
recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just 
requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. That </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 61 
</p>
<p>provision is further developed in for example, article 2, part 2, of the 1950 Council of Europe 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which establishes 
that deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of the right to life when 
it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary in defence of any 
person from unlawful violence, in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a 
person lawfully detained, in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or 
insurrection. Articles 18 and 22 of the 2006 Act specifically refer to persons suspected of 
participating in terrorist acts or committing such acts, i.e. persons caught in the act at the scene 
of a violent offence which is a terrorist act under article 205 of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>212. Articles 18 and 22 of the 2006 Act are consistent with the provisions of the relevant 
international legal instruments, as they are linked to articles 38 and 39 of the Criminal Code, 
which establish the lawfulness of inflicting damage, where absolutely necessary, when arresting 
offenders. 
</p>
<p>213. On trials in absentia. As is asserted in the communication, trial in absentia does not fully 
comply with those provisions of the Constitution that enshrine the human and civil right to 
protection of one&#8217;s rights and freedoms, the right to a trial and the adversarial principle. Under 
article 55, part 3, of the Constitution, human and civil rights and freedoms may be restricted by a 
federal law only to the extent necessary to protect the foundations of the constitutional order or 
the morality, health and rights and lawful interests of other persons, or to defend the country and 
national security. An example of one such restriction is conviction in absentia, which is covered 
by article 247 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>214. Conviction in absentia is known to the international community and is applied in various 
countries, including the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, 
Kazakhstan and Italy. For example, proceedings were brought against Osama bin Laden in 
June 2000 in accordance with rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure of the 
United States. 
</p>
<p>215. In this context, European Court of Human Rights judgement No. 56581/00 
of 10 November 2004, &#8220;Sejdovic v. Italy&#8221;, is extremely revealing, as it expresses the legal 
position of the Court on conviction in absentia. In particular, in relation to the violation of 
article 46 of the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, the Court held that the violation it had found had originated in a 
systemic problem connected with the malfunctioning of Italian legislation and practice caused by 
the lack of an effective mechanism to secure the right of persons convicted in absentia - where 
they had not been informed effectively of the proceedings against them and had not 
unequivocally waived their right to appear at their trial - to obtain a fresh determination of the 
merits of the charge against them by a court which had heard them in accordance with the 
requirements of article 6 of the Convention. The Court accordingly held that the respondent State 
had to secure the right in question, through appropriate measures, to the applicant and to other 
persons in a similar position. 
</p>
<p>216. On compensation and social rehabilitation of victims of terrorism. In the 
Russian Federation, articles 18 and 19 of the 2006 Act provide for measures for the legal 
protection of and social security for victims of terrorist acts. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 62 
 
</p>
<p>217. The social rehabilitation process for victims of terrorist acts and persons who have 
participated in the campaign against terrorism is established by Government decision No. 6 of 
12 January 2007 approving the rules concerning the social rehabilitation of victims of terrorist 
acts and persons participating in the campaign against terrorism. 
</p>
<p>218. Social rehabilitation includes psychological, medical and vocational rehabilitation, as well 
as legal aid and assistance in finding work and accommodation. Rehabilitation is aimed at 
helping victims adapt to and integrate into society. 
</p>
<p>219. The 2006 Act also provides for social-security measures for persons participating in the 
campaign against terrorism. In particular, Government decision No. 105 of 21 February 2008 on 
compensation for damage to the life and health of persons participating in the campaign against 
terrorism sets forth the procedure applicable to the legal arrangements for making a one-off 
payment to such persons or, in the case of their death, members of their family and/or 
dependants. 
</p>
<p>220. Consequently, in applying United Nations General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 
of 20 July 2004, which lays down that all States have the duty to take actions in conformity with 
international law and international humanitarian law to counter deadly acts of violence against 
their civilian population in order to protect the lives of their citizens, the Russian Federation 
adopted anti-terrorism legislation in 2006 which allows for effective measures to be taken to 
better protect its citizens from the threat of terrorism. Thus, while 257 terrorist acts were 
committed in 2005 (prior to the adoption of the 2006 Act), there were only 112 committed in 
2006 and 48 in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Spain 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Press statement by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>221. From 7 to 14 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur conducted an official country visit to 
Spain, at the invitation of the Government (see mission report A/HRC/3/10/Add.<footnote name="2">91. The fourth concern relates to the immunity from prosecution granted by section 17 of the 
Decree, which states that &#8220;a competent official and a person having identical powers and duties 
as a competent official under this Decree shall not be subject to civil, criminal or disciplinary 
liabilities arising from the performance of functions for the termination or prevention of an 
illegal act, provided that such act is performed in good faith, is non-discriminatory and is not 
unreasonable in the circumstances exceeding the extent of necessity, but does not preclude the 
right of a victim to seek compensation from a government agency under the law on liability for 
wrongful acts of officials&#8221;.  
</footnote>). On 
14 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued his preliminary findings during a press conference 
in Madrid. 
</p>
<p>222. The Special Rapporteur conducted an eight-day mission to Spain. The purpose of the 
mission, conducted at the invitation of the Spanish Government from 7 to 14 May 2008, was to 
undertake a fact-finding exercise and a legal assessment of Spain&#8217;s law and practice in the fight 
against terrorism, measured against international law, and considering the impact of 
counter-terrorism laws, policies and practices, including issues regarding investigation, 
detention, arrest and trial of terrorist suspects, the rights of victims of terrorism and persons 
negatively impacted by counter-terrorism measures. His approach to country visits is also aimed 
at identifying and disseminating best practice in the countering of terrorism. Following this visit, 
a full report, which will become publicly available, will be prepared and submitted to the Human 
Rights Council, a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly. The Special Rapporteur met 
with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Miguel Angel Moratinos Cuyaub&#233; and the Minister of 
Justice, Mr. Mariano Fernd&#225;ndez Bermejo. The Special Rapporteur had meetings on a specialist 
level with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, the Ministry 
of Defence, the Presidency of the Government, the Ombudsman, members of Parliament and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 63 
</p>
<p>members of the Judiciary, including the President of the Supreme Court who also serves as the 
President of the General Council of the Judiciary and the President of the Audiencia Nacional. 
The Special Rapporteur visited the Soto del Real detention facility, where he was able to conduct 
confidential interviews with detainees suspected of terrorist crimes, and the Audiencia Nacional 
where he observed ongoing judicial proceedings. In the Basque Autonomous Community, 
Mr. Scheinin visited San Sebasti&#225;n, Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz, and met with 
Mr Juan Jos&#233; Ibarretxe, the President of the Government of the Basque Autonomous 
Community, as well as the Councillor of Justice, the Councillor of the Interior, the Ombudsman, 
the Human Rights Director and the delegate of the Spanish Central Government. He also visited 
the Basque Parliament. Both in Madrid and in the Basque Country he met with lawyers, 
academics, victims of terrorism and non-governmental organisations. 
</p>
<p>223. Terrorist threats in Spain. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of the tragic incidents of 
domestic and international terrorism that have had devastating effects in Spain. The long history 
of ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) terrorism primarily in the Basque Country, and the bomb 
attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 are graphic illustrations of the inexcusable nature of 
terrorist violence. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was moved by his meetings with 
victims of terrorism and their families, as well as by an exhibition at the Basque Parliament 
dedicated to victims of terrorism. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of the dark pages of 
Spanish history when the state itself during the Franco dictatorship resorted to methods that can 
be classified as terrorism, or when the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci&#243;n (GAL) in the 
aftermath of the turn to democracy resorted to methods of terrorism in the name of countering 
terrorism. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, acts of terrorism, including those by ETA, 
amount to the destruction of human rights. For nearly four decades Spain has struggled with the 
terrorist activities carried out by ETA, whose proclaimed political goal is self-determination for 
the Basque Country, a goal that is advocated also by political parties or other organizations that 
have nothing to do with terrorism. The Spanish Government has fought ETA terrorism through 
both law enforcement and judicial operations, which have, to a great extent, weakened the 
impact of the organization. ETA however, is still considered an ongoing threat, which affects not 
only the Basque Country, but the entire nation. After efforts to initiate a peace process between 
the Spanish central authorities and ETA broke down in 2007, the organization has returned to 
violent activities and announced its responsibility for 11 attacks during the four first months of 
2008, including the death of one person. Spanish authorities told the Special Rapporteur that not 
only is the military branch of the organization perceived as a serious terrorist threat, but that the 
fight against ETA necessarily has to include all of its network, including political, social and 
grassroots organizations as well as media enterprises. The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
activities by such organizations are perceived as being closely linked to ETA, as they are 
promoting the goals of the terrorist organization through the provision of financial and material 
support as well as by altering the public order through violent demonstrations and threats against 
persons not agreeing with ETA&#8217;s aims or means. Since the beginning of the 1990s, and in 
particular following the tragic events of 11 March 2004, Spain has strengthened its efforts 
against international terrorism. Due to repeated references to Spain by Al-Qaida leaders during 
last years and the development of what was described to the Special Rapporteur as 
self-radicalized Islamist terrorist cells inside Spain, their threat is perceived as constituting an 
ongoing danger. In addition Spanish authorities give regard to radical cells linked to Al-Qaida 
that operate outside the Spanish territory, mainly in Morocco and Algeria. The Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that, in general, Spanish authorities do not link the threat of international 
terrorism to illegal or legal immigration, while remaining aware of the risk that terrorist 
organizations may take advantage of immigrant communities as a ground for recruitment. 
</p>
<p>224. Spain&#8217;s international role. Within the United Nations and elsewhere Spain has an important 
role in the global fight against terrorism. The Madrid Summit of 2005 and its contribution 
towards the General Assembly&#8217;s 2006 Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy as well as the 
initiative Alliance of Civilizations represent important phases in that process. On the 
international level Spain has endorsed the imperative of respecting human rights while fighting 
against terrorism, both as an end in itself and as a key factor for the efficiency of action against 
terrorism. The Special Rapporteur identifies Spain&#8217;s active role on the international level a best 
practice and calls upon Spain to maintain that role, including through initiatives for further 
improvements of the UN terrorist listing and delisting procedures to bring them into line with 
human rights and due process. 
</p>
<p>225. Definitions of terrorist crimes. Many of the meetings during the visit focused on how 
terrorist crimes are defined in Spanish statutory law and judicial practice. Referring to his earlier 
work in the issue (see, in particular E/CN.4/2006/98), the Special Rapporteur once again 
emphasizes that the successful fight against terrorism requires strict adherence to the requirement 
of legality enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), so that all elements of the crime are in explicit and precise terms encapsulated in legal 
definitions of terrorist crimes. Underlining the centrality of deadly or otherwise serious physical 
violence against members of the general population or segments of it as a defining element of 
terrorist crimes, the Special Rapporteur warns against broad and vague definitions that ultimately 
undermine the strong moral message inherent in strict definitions based on the inexcusable 
nature of every single act of terrorism. Legitimately, and in compliance with international and 
European treaties against terrorism, Spain has criminalized not only terrorist violence itself but 
also associated crimes such as the financing of terrorism or incitement to terrorism. After a 
careful examination of the law and evolving practice of defining terrorist crimes in Spain, the 
Special Rapporteur highlights at the end of his country visit two preliminary conclusions: 
</p>
<p> (a) Article 571 of the Penal Code, defining the objective elements of terrorist crimes, is 
in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view based on a proper understanding of the phenomenon of 
terrorism and of the requirement of legality.  
</p>
<p> (b) Other provisions of the relevant section of the Penal Code (articles 572-580), 
including the reference to &#8220;any other crime&#8221; in article 574, the notion of &#8220;collaboration&#8221; in 
article 576 and the amended provision of article 577 on street violence, however, carry the risk 
of a &#8220;slippery slope&#8221;, i.e. the gradual broadening of the notion of terrorism to acts that do not 
amount to, and do not have sufficient connection to, acts of serious violence against members of 
the general population. The Special Rapporteur calls the attention of Spanish authorities to the 
latter finding, especially because of the existence of multiple factors that in the context of Spain 
highlight the risk of a &#8220;slippery slope&#8221;: the classification of crimes as terrorist ones triggers the 
application of incommunicado detention, replaces the jurisdiction of the territorial criminal court 
by the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Nacional, a specialized court with nationwide jurisdiction, 
and results in aggravated penalties and often also modifications in the rules related to the serving 
of sentences. As many recent high-profile prosecutions are pending before the Audiencia 
Nacional or subject to review by the Supreme Court, the Special Rapporteur will not at this stage </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 65 
</p>
<p>comment upon the application of articles 571-580 of the Penal Code in these cases. However, he 
is aware of vocal criticism against a trend of broadening the scope of practical application of 
these provisions by the Audiencia Nacional. Mindful of the double risk of such a trend resulting 
both in compromising the requirement of legality enshrined in ICCPR article 15 and 
undermining the legitimacy and hence efficiency of the fight against terrorism, the Special 
Rapporteur calls upon the Spanish Government to initiate a process of independent expert review 
over the adequacy of the current definitions. In his final report on the country visit, to be 
prepared in consultation with the Spanish authorities, the Special Rapporteur will make 
proposals concerning the methodology of such a process of expert review and offer his own 
detailed comments on the existing definitions under Spanish law.  
</p>
<p>226. The framework of human rights law. None of the authorities the Special Rapporteur met 
with made any reference to arguments that would deny or reduce the applicability of 
international human rights law in respect of counter-terrorism measures by Spain. In particular, 
no reference was made to the existence of an armed conflict or a state of emergency as excuses 
that might result in derogation from human rights law. Furthermore, both national police 
authorities (the National Police and the Civil Guard) explicitly excluded the use of a necessity 
defence or analogous arguments as justification for the use of methods of interrogation that by 
way of exception would depart from Spanish law or international standards. The Special 
Rapporteur underlines the importance of an unconditional commitment by all authorities to the 
principle that terrorism must be combated within the framework of the law, including human 
rights law. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the assurances given by his interlocutors that 
Spain is currently not engaged outside its national territory in any activities that would violate 
human rights, and does not allow the use of its territory for such acts. However, it was 
acknowledged that Spanish consular and intelligence authorities in 2002 were present in the 
interrogations of a number of persons detained in Guant&#225;namo Bay, including one Spanish 
national and one Moroccan legally residing in Spain. Subsequently two persons were brought to 
trial in Spain. In this regard the Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent decision by the 
Audiencia Nacional to dismiss the charges as any information obtained in Guant&#225;namo 
interrogations is inadmissible as evidence in any type of judicial proceedings. The Special 
Rapporteur also received information related to Spain&#8217;s involvement in the CIA programme of 
extraordinary renditions and is aware of a judicial investigation that is underway as to the use of 
Spanish airports in the transfer of terrorist suspects. The authorities informed the Special 
Rapporteur that such flights had in fact landed at Spanish civilian airports in 2004, stating that no 
evidence of human rights violations had been established in relation to these incidents. The 
Special Rapporteur stresses the obligation of the state to conduct proper and thorough 
investigations into the case and awaits with interest the results of the judicial investigation in the 
matter. He recalls that the practice of extraordinary renditions on its own amounts to a human 
rights violation as arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance or inhuman, cruel or degrading 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>227. Prohibition against torture and other forms of inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment. The 
Special Rapporteur calls for increased vigilance in implementing Spain&#8217;s commitment to the 
eradication of torture. Mindful of the widespread use of torture and other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment by authorities during the Franco dictatorship, the Special 
Rapporteur expresses his concern over the fact that allegations of torture or other forms of 
ill-treatment continue to be made by terrorism suspects and do not systematically result in rapid 
and thorough independent investigations. The Special Rapporteur sees this situation as </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 66 
 
</p>
<p>delegitimizing the Government&#8217;s fight against terrorism among those segments of Spanish 
society that would most need to be convinced of the genuineness of the central Government&#8217;s 
dedication to zero tolerance of torture. Against this assessment, the Special Rapporteur identifies 
further measures against torture or ill-treatment as a priority in the improvement of Spain&#8217;s 
framework of counter-terrorism. During the visit the Special Rapporteur was informed of recent 
positive developments, such as the so-called &#8220;Garzon protocol&#8221;, applicable in cases where the 
detainee is held in incommunicado detention. The protocol encompasses a system of oversight 
through constant video-surveillance of police detention facilities and interrogation rooms, 
examinations by forensic doctors of the detainee&#8217;s own choice as well as the possibility to 
receive visits by family members. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these measures but is 
aware, however, that the protocol has not yet been systematically implemented. It is applied only 
through judicial decision in an individual case and hence, by definition, in many cases not from 
the moment of arrest. Further, only some of the Audiencia Nacional judges apply the protocol. 
As an element of best practice, the Special Rapporteur learned that incommunicado detention has 
been practically eradicated in cases where the Basque autonomous police forces detain terrorism 
suspects and apply more advanced protocols adopted by the relevant Basque authorities. The 
Special Rapporteur calls for the complete eradication of the institution of incommunicado 
detention. This step, proposed, inter alia, by the Human Rights Committee in 1996 
(CCPR/C/79/Add.61) and the Special Rapporteur on Torture in 2003 (E/CN.4/2004/56/Add.<footnote name="2">90. The Special Rapporteur therefore urged the Government to review these provisions and to 
set up adequate standards against possible serious human rights abuses, including against 
arbitrary arrest or detention, such as the right to be brought promptly before a judge and the 
entitlement to trial within a reasonable amount of time or release as well as the right to challenge </footnote>) 
would strengthen the credibility of counter-terrorism measures by the law enforcement bodies as 
a whole and would at the same time further assure that those falsely accused of ill-treatment of 
terrorism suspects could be cleared. 
</p>
<p>228. Measures related to the Madrid 2004 bombings and international terrorism. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the statements by his interlocutors that the terrorist acts of 11 March 2004 
have not resulted in xenophobic reactions among the Spanish population. However, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed by lawyers and NGOs of incidents of inappropriate treatment of 
Muslim detainees, including disrespect for their religious beliefs and practices. The penitentiary 
authorities admitted to the Special Rapporteur that such instances of improper conduct by prison 
officials have occurred, and assured that authorities are aware of the counterproductive 
consequences of any discrimination or unprofessional behaviour. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes and encourages the willingness of the Government to initiate human rights training 
within the penitentiary system. The Special Rapporteur received detailed information on the 
practical challenges of organizing the multi-accused trial concerning the March 2004 Madrid 
bombings. While being mindful of the fact that appeals are still pending, the Special Rapporteur 
notes that many features of the trial phase could serve as best practice in organizing the criminal 
trial of a major act of international terrorism. Despite this highly pertinent information 
concerning the actual M-11 trial, the Special Rapporteur is mindful of particular difficulties 
encountered by the defence in the preparation of the trial. It was preceded by months or years of 
pre-trial detention during which time court-appointed lawyers were in practice unable to provide 
any assistance to their clients due to a number of factors: the secrecy of the investigation, the 
dispersal of the detainees to different parts of the country, the inadequacy of compensation of 
travel costs and the unavailability of independent interpretation services as part of the legal aid 
system for meetings between lawyer and client. The Special Rapporteur was provided with 
statistics compiled by the penitentiary authorities according to which 120 persons in pre-trial 
detention or serving their sentences are categorized as &#8220;Al-Qaida&#8221;. Having met with two persons </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 67 
</p>
<p>in this category during his visit to the Soto del Real detention facility, the Special Rapporteur 
calls for the reconsideration of such a classification. During his visit to Spain the Special 
Rapporteur learned about a case concerning a Chechen possibly facing extradition to Russia for 
crimes of terrorism. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that formal assurances have 
played a useful role in respect of the death penalty where the executive authorities of the 
receiving country can commit themselves to not asking for capital punishment and their 
compliance with the assurances will be controlled through a public trial, there is widespread 
agreement that diplomatic assurances do not work in respect of the risk of torture or other 
ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur notes with surprise that Audiencia Nacional appears to 
have combined traditional death penalty assurances in the pending case with the condition that 
the UN Committee Against Torture will be able to send a delegation to visit him. Mindful of the 
fact that CAT does not conduct such visits and of the inadequacy of assurances in respect of the 
risk of torture, the Special Rapporteur proposes that the Government seeks a new judicial 
opinion if it wishes to pursue the extradition of the individual in question. 
</p>
<p>229. The right to review by a higher court.<b> </b> All persons convicted of a crime have, pursuant to 
article 14, paragraph 5, of the ICCPR, a right to have their conviction and sentence reviewed by 
a higher court. According to established Human Rights Committee case law under this provision, 
cassation review by a higher instance, limited to issues of law, is not sufficient for compliance 
with the ICCPR. Because of terrorism cases in Spain are heard exclusively by a single court, the 
Audiencia Nacional, and the role of the Supreme Court is traditionally limited to issues of law, 
the existing mechanisms of review by a higher court appear to suffer from a structural 
deficiency. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of judicial and legislative measures taken by 
Spanish authorities to reach compliance with ICCPR article 14 (5). Nevertheless, he wishes to 
point out that the problem remains valid in respect of major pending terrorism-related cases with 
dozens of accused or convicted persons. The Special Rapporteur requests the Spanish 
Government to give consideration to the possibility of including terrorism crimes in the 
jurisdiction of ordinary courts, instead of a single central specialized court (Audiencia Nacional). 
This would correspond to the principle of normalcy and address terrorism as a crime, rather than 
an emergency calling for departure from standard procedures. The Special Rapporteur believes 
that transferring jurisdiction for terrorism crimes to ordinary courts with territorial jurisdiction 
would enhance the legitimacy of Spain&#8217;s fight against terrorism and add to its efficiency.  
</p>
<p>230. Victims of terrorism. Mindful of the fact that terrorist attacks cause widespread suffering 
and grievances throughout the society, the Special Rapporteur notes that Spanish authorities have 
undertaken a number of legislative and administrative measures in order to properly address, 
through material, legal and psychological assistance, the situation faced by victims of terrorism, 
including victims of violent attacks carried out by ETA, victims of international terrorist acts and 
victims of GAL in the 1980s. Proper consideration given to those who individually, or 
collectively, have suffered harm, is an essential measure in order to further good community 
relations. Spanish authorities highlighted that annual ceremonies are organized to pay tribute to 
the victims of the Madrid bombings of 2004. The Special Rapporteur stresses the highly 
important value of human rights education and the fostering of tolerance and solidarity within 
the society as a means of avoiding conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>231. Acknowledgements. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the cooperation of the 
Government of Spain. He also thanks all his interlocutors for sharing their insights and ideas. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>232. On 28 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government 
of Sri Lanka regarding the &#8220;<b>Emergency (Prevention and Prohibition of Terrorism and 
Specified Terrorist Activities) Regulations No. 07 of 2006</b>&#8221; promulgated by the President on 
6 December 2006 and to the &#8220;<b>Emergency (Miscellaneous provisions and powers) Regulation 
No.1 of 2005</b>&#8221; promulgated by the President on 13 August 2005. The Special Rapporteur 
highlighted four areas of concern relating to this legislation. According to information the 
Special Rapporteur has received: 
</p>
<p>233. The Emergency Regulations of terrorist acts contain a broad definition of terrorism and 
terrorist acts (Regulations 6, 7 and 20) and lack compliance with the principle of legality. The 
principle of legality in criminal law, enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant of Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Sri Lanka is a party to, is non-derogable in times of 
public emergency and implies that the requirement of criminal liability is limited to clear and 
precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law and ensure that 
it is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the proscribed conduct. 
234. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, terrorist crimes need to be defined in precise terms and 
primarily through the means used, which can be described as deadly or otherwise serious 
violence against members of the general population or segments of it, or the taking of hostages. 
The definition of terrorism in Regulation 20 does not meet this requirement as it defines 
terrorism through the unlawfulness of the conduct rather than through the use of violence against 
persons.  
</p>
<p>235. It appears that the broad definition of terrorism contained in Regulation 20 allows for the 
possible criminalisation as terrorist offences of a range of unlawful conducts that should not been 
understood as terrorist activities. By way of example, the &#8220;destruction or damage to property&#8221; 
committed during a demonstration of teachers or civil servants asking for a change in certain 
policies of the government or for new laws (new educational policies or legislation for example) 
could be included in the definition of terrorism. This broad definition could therefore have a 
negative impact on certain activities of civil society and could violate important human rights 
such as the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association.  
</p>
<p>236. Under the Emergency Regulations &#8220;no person shall engage in any transaction in any 
manner whatsoever&#8221; with any &#8220;person, group or group of persons&#8221; acting in contravention of 
regulations 6 and 7, even if they have no knowledge or intention that their acts contribute to help 
allegedly terrorists (Regulation 8). In certain circumstances such as the furtherance of peace, it is 
provided that a &#8220;Competent Authority&#8221; appointed by the President, could approve &#8220;either 
unconditionally or subject to stipulated conditions&#8221; a &#8220;lawful transaction&#8221;. People aggrieved by a 
decision taken by this Authority is entitled to appeal against such decision to an &#8220;Appeals 
Tribunal&#8221; composed of the Secretaries to the Ministries of Defence, Nation Building, Plan 
Implementation and Justice. The Tribunal can affirm, vary or rescind conditionally or 
unconditionally the decision (Regulation 18). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 69 
</p>
<p>237. This provision presents many concerns especially in regard to humanitarian activities 
undertaken by national and international organisations working in Sri Lanka. Regulation 8 is 
drafted in a very broad language allowing for the possible criminalisation of a range of legitimate 
activities of civil society. Moreover, the appointment by the President of a &#8220;Competent 
Authority&#8221; gives this Authority the discretionary power over the activities of civil society 
organizations. At the same time, this discretionary power gives the Government excessive 
control over civil society organizations which is incompatible with the freedom of expression 
and association as well as other freedoms that are necessary for the independence and autonomy 
of such organizations.  
</p>
<p>238. In addition, the &#8220;Appeals Tribunal&#8221; does not meet the criteria of independence and 
impartiality required by international instruments and represents a departure from the principle 
of separation of powers as well as an interference of government into the judicial sphere. 
According to article 14 (1) of the ICCPR, in the determination of the rights and obligations of an 
individual in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  
</p>
<p>239. Regulation 19 provides that &#8220;no action or suit shall lie against any Public Servant&#8221; or any 
other person specifically authorized by the Government to take action in terms of the 
Regulations &#8220;provided that such person has acted in good faith and in the discharge of his 
official duties&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>240. This provision bans any legal proceedings to government officials who may commit 
unlawful acts while implementing the regulations if they act in good faith. When States engage 
in counter terrorism measures it is possible that significant violations of human rights such as 
arbitrary detention or torture may be committed by officials. Governments have the obligation 
under international law to investigate and prosecute violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law. This wide immunity clause does not comply with the international obligations 
of Sri Lanka and could lead to situations of impunity. Investigations and prosecutions should 
always take place regardless to bona fides. Only an independent and impartial tribunal should be 
the one to examine if the official has acted in good faith during the discharge of his official 
duties.  
</p>
<p>241. According to Provision 19 of the Emergency Regulations of 2005, the detention of a 
person without charge can be extended up to 12 months. The vaguely worded regulations allow 
for the detention of any person &#8220;acting in any manner prejudicial to the national security or to the 
maintenance of public order or to the maintenance of essential services&#8221;. Since there is no legal 
requirement for the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence to specify the period of detention, this 
provision may result in arbitrary arrests and detention of suspects, often not connected to terrorist 
acts, up to one year.  
</p>
<p>242. Finally, the Special Rapporteur also reminded the Government that the United Nations 
General Assembly Resolution 59/191, in paragraph 1 stresses that &#8220;States must ensure that any 
measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in 
particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>243. In summary, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Emergency Regulations are not 
in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards. In this regard, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 70 
 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur would ask the Government to bring to the attention of relevant governmental 
and parliamentary bodies that in my opinion this legislation needs to be significantly amended. 
The Special Rapporteur took this opportunity to make the following suggestions: 1. To ensure 
that the Emergency Regulations contain a revised definition of terrorism and terrorist acts, 
limiting the scope of criminalisation to acts of deadly or otherwise grave violence against 
members of the general population. In this regard the Special Rapporteur drew the attention of 
the Government to his first report to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/98) in 
particular paragraphs 26-50, which deal with the issue of defining terrorism and may help to 
ensure that the fundamental human rights standards of legality set forth in Article 15 of the 
ICCPR are respected. 2. To ensure that Regulation 8 is modified in order to guarantee the respect 
of human rights of Sri Lankan population as well as the independence of civil society and 
humanitarian organizations. 3. To ensure that any &#8220;Appeal Tribunal&#8221; meets the international 
criteria of independence, impartiality and transparent and fair procedures. 4. To ensure that all 
violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed while countering terrorism are 
investigated and prosecuted, and that only an independent and impartial tribunal could determine 
if officials act in good faith and in the discharge of his official duties or not. 5. To ensure that all 
powers to detain persons for reasons related to terrorism or national security comply with 
international standards, including those enshrined in article 9 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, such as the prohibition against arbitrary arrest, the requirement of 
informing the detained person of the reasons for arrest, the speedy appearance before a court of 
anyone arrested as suspected of a crime and the right of anyone detained on other grounds to 
have the lawfulness of the detention reviewed by a court without delay.  
</p>
<p>244. On 14 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, sent a communication regarding the case of Mr. N. <b>Jasikaren</b>, a 
former journalist with the Tamil language bi-monthly &#8220;<i>Sariniher</i>&#8221; and journalist with the web 
news service &#8220;<i>Outreachsl.com</i>&#8221; and owner of the Outreach Multimedia and E-Kwality Graphics, 
a printing press; Ms. <b>Valarmathi Jasikaren</b>, his wife;<b> </b>Mr.<b> J.S. Tissanaygam</b>, journalist with the 
&#8220;<i>Sunday Times</i>&#8221; and the &#8220;<i>Daily Mirror</i>&#8221; and chief editor of the &#8220;<i>Northeastern &#8211; Herald</i>&#8221; an 
English-language regional newspaper and &#8220;<i>Outreachsl.com</i>&#8221;; Mr. <b>K. Wijayasinghe</b>, a freelance 
journalist, who writes for the weekly newspaper &#8220;<i>Ravaya</i>&#8221;, the daily &#8220;<i>Mawbima</i>&#8221; and 
&#8220;<i>Outreachsl.com</i>&#8221;; Mr. <b>Udayen</b>, a video editor for &#8220;<i>Outreachsl.com</i>&#8221;; and 
Mr. <b>A.G. Lasantha Ranga</b>, a video journalist for &#8220;<i>Outreachsl.com</i>&#8221;. According to information 
received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. N. Jasikaren was arrested by the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID) (a special 
police division that reports directly to the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence) at his 
office on the evening of 6 March 2008; during his arrest, his laptop and printed materials 
were seized by the TID. Mr. Jasikaren is being held at the TID offices in Colombo. 
Mr. Jasikaren&#8217;s wife, Valarmathi Jasikaren, a marketing officer with Maharaja 
Broadcasting, was arrested on 6 March at their home on the same day. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Jasikaren was assaulted by TID officers. Valarmathi Jasikaren suffers from a liver 
disease and underwent surgery a few weeks ago, and there is no indication that she has 
access to her medication in custody. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 71 
</p>
<p>J.S. Tissanaygam and K. Wijayasinghe were arrested by TID officers on 7 March at 
11:<footnote name="30">0. The participation and involvement of people from various sectors in ISOC: Under 
Article 9 (3/1), an advisory group of ISOC will be set up taking into account the participation </footnote> a.m. when they went to TID offices to inquire about the arrests of Mr. Jasikaren and 
his wife. Mr. Tissanaygam was detained incommunicado until late in the evening of 
7 March, when his family was informed of his whereabouts. Both men are being detained 
at the TID offices in Colombo. Mr. Tissanaygam and Mr. Wijayasinghe&#8217;s wives were 
allowed to visit them. 
</p>
<p>Udayen was arrested at his home on 7 March. He was detained incommunicado until 
midnight and he is being held at the TID offices in Colombo. 
</p>
<p>A.G. Lasantha Ranga was requested to report to the TID offices before 3 p.m. on 8 March. 
He has been detained since then at the TID offices in Colombo. Mr. Ranga&#8217;s wife visited 
him on 10 March. Mr. Ranga was threatened by TID officers in front of her, stating that if 
Mr. Ranga had seen how Jasikaren and Tissanayagam were tortured &#8220;he would die on the 
spot&#8221;. TID officers told her that she should not visit her husband with a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>A seventh person, Mr. Siva Sivakumar, journalist and spokesperson for the Free Media 
Movement and chief editor of the Tamil-language newspapers &#8220;<i>Sarinher</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Adhavan</i>&#8221;, 
was also arrested on 8 March 2008. He was, however, released after a detention period of 
12 hours during which a statement was taken from him. TID officers had gone to his home 
on the evening of 7 March to arrest him, but took his cousin into custody instead as he was 
absent. TID officers informed Mr. Sivakumar&#8217;s relatives that his cousin would be released 
when he presents himself to TID offices, which he did in the morning of 8 March.  
</p>
<p>With regard to the above persons who have been arrested, detention orders have reportedly 
been prepared pursuant to Regulation 21 of the Emergency (Prevention and Prohibition of 
Terrorism and Specified Terrorist Activities) Regulations No. 7 of 2006. However, to date 
none of the accused have seen the detention order. It is also not clear if it was the Secretary 
of the Ministry of Defence or a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the police who issued 
detention orders in this case. If detention orders have been issued, the detainees must be 
brought before a magistrate at least once every 30 days, but this is only to verify that the 
person is still being detained. Magistrates have no power to question, cancel or renew a 
detention order. Only the person issuing the detention order - the Secretary of Defence or 
the DIG - can renew, amend or cancel it.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>With regard to the cases of Mr. Jasikaren and his wife, TID officials have issued receipts 
acknowledging their arrests and citing as a reason aiding and abetting terrorist activities. 
No information has yet been given concerning the reason for the detention of the remaining 
persons and their arrests and detention have not yet been acknowledged by the TID. 
However, a few weeks before the arrests, authorities proclaimed that some websites 
reporting on human rights violations were a hindrance to the ongoing war. 
</p>
<p>All meetings with relatives were held in the presence of TID officers. None of the above 
cited persons were allowed access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>245. The Special Rapporteurs referred the Government to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, to which the Government is a party, and in particular Article 9 (4), which 
requires that &#8220;Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 72 
 
</p>
<p>take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the 
lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful.&#8221;, and 
Article 14 (1), which requires that &#8220;everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a 
competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>246. Please indicate the legal basis for the arrest and detention of the aforementioned persons 
and how these measures are compatible with applicable international human rights norms and 
standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In particular, please explain on what legal 
and factual grounds all or some of the persons mentioned where arrested by the Terrorist 
Investigations Department (TID). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government

<p>249. On 11 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent a communication regarding the <b>death sentences imposed against 30 men</b> 
convicted on charges connected to the attack on Omdurman on 10 May 2008 led by the Justice 
and Equality Movement. According to the information we have received: 
</p>

</p>
<p>attack on Omdurman on 10 May 2008. Following their apprehension, they were held 
without access to the outside world for over one month and were not given access to 
lawyers until after the trial proceedings opened.  
</p>
<p>As of 18 June 2008, these 30 men and other defendants were presented before newly 
created counter-terrorism courts in greater Khartoum. Five special courts were created in 
early June in response to the attack on Omdurman and these 30 men and other defendants 
were brought before three of these special courts. Observers noticed that the defendants 
looked tired and appeared to be in pain. The defendants complained that they were 
subjected to torture or ill-treatment, but the court did not investigate these allegations and 
refused to grant requests by the defendants&#8217; lawyers for independent medical examinations.  
</p>
<p>On 29 and 31 July 2008, the courts announced their verdicts. They sentenced the 30 above 
named defendants to death, acquitted one, and ordered the transfer of four minors, to a 
detention facility where more than 90 children captured after the attacks are being held. 
One of those sentenced to death, Mahmood Adam Zariba, is reportedly a minor of 16 years 
of age, whose age was not determined by a medical examination. The 30 defendants were 
found guilty of a range of criminal charges defined in the 1991 Criminal Act, the 2001 
Counter-Terrorism Act and the 1986 Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act. The charges 
included terrorist acts, participation in a terrorist criminal organization (respectively 
sections 5 and 6 of the Counter-Terrorism Act), as well as criminal conspiracy, waging war 
against the state and sedition (respectively sections 24, 51 and 63 of the Criminal Act). 
</p>
<p>In reaching their verdicts, the courts relied as evidence primarily on confessions by the 
defendants which the defendants said they were forced to make under torture and 
ill-treatment and which they retracted in court. The court made reference to the Sudanese 
Evidence Act which permits the admission to judicial proceedings of statements obtained 
by unlawful means. The court also relied on the testimonies by children who have been 
detained since the attacks and who stated in court that they recognized the defendants as 
having been among the attackers. 
</p>
<p>250. The Special Rapporteurs understand that judgments in respect of 28 further defendants are 
expected to be announced shortly, and that charges may be brought against others currently held 
without charge or trial.  
</p>
<p>251. In this respect, the Special Rapporteurs drew the attention of the Government to 
paragraph 12 of General Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which 
&#8220;reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect 
the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person&#8221;. Prolonged 
incommunicado detention furthermore negates the abovementioned guarantees of the right to a 
fair trial, such as being assisted by a lawyer and having adequate facilities to prepare one&#8217;s 
defence.  
</p>
<p>252. The Special Rapporteurs recalled that Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/39 
urges States to ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of 
torture shall not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 74 
 
</p>
<p>evidence that the statement was made. In addition to being a crucial fair trial guarantee, this 
principle is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable right to physical and mental integrity set 
forth, inter alia, in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Reports 
that the court refused requests by the defence lawyers for medical examination of the defendants 
and then relied on their self-incriminating statements made during incommunicado detention 
and, allegedly, under torture would appear to suggest a particularly serious violation of these 
principles of international law. 
</p>
<p>253. The Special Rapporteurs are also concerned by reports that the procedures of the special 
counter-terrorism courts are determined by the Chief Justice. The Special Rapporteurs received 
information that the procedural rules of these courts may override existing laws, dispensing with 
certain guarantees contained in the Sudanese Criminal Procedure Code. For example, under the 
courts&#8217; rules of procedure defendants may only appeal the verdict once. 
</p>
<p>254. It is the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; understanding that the 30 men were apprehended, charged 
and convicted in connection with the attack by hundreds of armed fighters of the Justice and 
Equality Movement on Omdurman, which could be seen as part of the ongoing armed conflict 
between the Government and this rebel armed group in Darfur. In this context, the question of 
the applicability of international humanitarian law to the proceedings against the thirty men 
arises.  
</p>
<p>255. In this respect the Special Rapporteurs would like to bring to the Government&#8217;s attention 
that under Geneva Convention III and other international humanitarian law and international 
human rights norms applicable in all types of armed conflict all who are detained or tried are 
protected by certain fundamental guarantees. Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions 
of 1949 and Article 6 of Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, relating to the 
protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts (Additional Protocol II), which the 
Government acceded to in 2006, prohibit the passing of sentences and the carrying out of 
sentences without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all 
the judicial guarantees. This prohibition is also reflected in a rule of customary law stating that 
&#8220;no one may be convicted or sentenced, except pursuant to a fair trial affording all essential 
judicial guarantees&#8221; (Rule 100 of the Customary Rules of International Humanitarian Law 
identified in the study of the International Committee of the Red Cross). 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 75 
</p>
<p>judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent a communication regarding the <b>death sentences imposed by 
counter-terrorism courts in greater Khartoum against 20 additional men</b> on 17 and 
20 August 2008. The men were convicted on charges connected to the attack on Omdurman on 
10 May 2008 led by the Justice and Equality Movement. According to the information the 
Special Rapporteurs have received: 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2008, a counter-terrorism court in Khartoum found <b>Abdelaziz Al Nour 
Aousher Fedail</b>,<b> Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam</b>,<b> Al Taib Abdelkarim Idris 
Adam</b>,<b> Bashir Adam Aousher Fedail</b>,<b> Hamid Hassan Hamid Ahmed</b>,<b> Malik Adam 
Ahmed Mohamed</b>,<b> Mohamed Bahar Ali Hamadeen</b>,<b> </b>and<b> Tag Al Deen Mahmoud 
Abdurahman Ali </b>guilty on a range of offences under the 1991 Criminal Act, the 1986 
Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act an and the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act and 
sentenced them to death. On 20 August 2008, a counter-terrorism court sitting in 
Omdurman sentenced another twelve men to death on similar charges: <b>Azrag Daldoum 
Adam</b>,<b> Yahia Fadel Abaker Adam</b>,<b> Musa Abdallah Ali Shugar</b>,<b> Mohamed Abaker 
Naser Hussein</b>,<b> Ibrahim Saleh Ali, Idriss Omar Mohamed Ahmed</b>,<b> Mahjoub 
Suleiman Adam</b>,<b> Naser Jibreel Adam</b>,<b> Abdallah Mursal Tour</b>,<b> Adam Ibrahim Nur 
Mohamed</b>,<b> James Bol Francis</b>,<b> </b>and <b>Adam Suleiman Abaker</b>. The court also acquitted 
four defendants in this trial and referred four defendants to be tried by juvenile offender 
courts. 
</p>
<p>258. The allegations the Special Rapporteurs received with regard to the detention and trial of 
the persons named above are very similar to those brought to the Government&#8217;s attention on 
11 August 2008 in relation to another 30 persons sentenced to death on 29 and 31 July 2008. 
They were arrested in the days following the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) attack on 
Omdurman on 10 May 2008. Following their apprehension, they were held without access to the 
outside world by the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). It would appear that they 
were not given access to lawyers until after the trial proceedings opened. In reaching their 
verdicts, the Khartoum and Omdurman counter-terrorism courts appear to have relied primarily 
on confessions by the defendants as evidence. Most of the defendants said they were forced to 
make these confessions under torture and ill-treatment and retracted them in court. No 
investigations were opened to investigate these allegations. 
</p>
<p>259. One of the defendants sentenced to death by the Khartoum counter-terrorism court 
on 17 August 2008 is a minor. Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam is 17 years old and the 
court accepted his birth certificate as valid documentation of his age. It found, however, that 
since Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam was found guilty of hiraba, or brigandage 
(Article 167 of the Criminal Act), a hudud offence, he could nevertheless be sentenced to death. 
Article 27(2) of the Sudanese Criminal Act allows the death penalty to be applied for hudud 
crimes regardless of age.  
</p>
<p>260. The Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government that in capital punishment cases the 
obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a fair trial set out in 
Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sudan is a party 
and which (pursuant to article 27(3) of Sudan&#8217;s Interim National Constitution) is &#8220;an integral 
part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of Rights, admits of no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 76 
 
</p>
<p>these guarantees include the right to &#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of 
[one&#8217;s] defence and to communicate with counsel of [one&#8217;s] own choosing&#8221; and the right not to 
be compelled to confess guilt.  
</p>
<p>261. With regard to the right to &#8220;have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his 
defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing&#8221; (Article 14(3)(b) of the 
Covenant), the Human Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving capital 
punishment, it is axiomatic that the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages 
of the proceedings.&#8221; (General Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). If it was confirmed 
that the 20 defendants sentenced to death were only able to speak to their lawyers when their 
trials began after more than a month of detention, this would negate the possibility of a fair trial.  
</p>
<p>262. The Special Rapporteurs are also concerned by reports that the procedures of the special 
counter-terrorism courts are determined by the Chief Justice. The Special Rapporteurs received 
information that the procedural rules of these courts may override existing laws, dispensing with 
certain guarantees contained in the Sudanese Criminal Procedure Code. For example, under the 
courts&#8217; rules of procedure defendants may only appeal the verdict once. 
</p>
<p>263. It is the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; understanding that the 20 prisoners sentenced to death were 
apprehended, charged and convicted in connection with the JEM attack on Omdurman, which 
could be seen as part of the ongoing armed conflict between your Government and this rebel 
armed group in Darfur. In this context, the question of the applicability of international 
humanitarian law to the proceedings arises. In the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; communication to the 
Government of 11 August 2008, to which they refer in this respect, they drew the Government&#8217;s 
attention to the norms of international humanitarian law protecting persons apprehended and 
detained in the course of an armed conflict. These norms provide that no such detainee may be 
convicted or sentenced, except pursuant to a fair trial affording all essential judicial guarantees, 
including assistance by counsel and the prohibition of moral or physical coercion exerted in 
order to induce him to admit guilt.  
</p>
<p>264. To sum up, both in human rights law and under international humanitarian law, only the 
full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment, applied in 
conformity with international law, from a summary execution which violates the most 
fundamental human right. The Special Rapporteurs therefore urge the Government to take all 
necessary steps to ensure that the rights under international law of the twenty prisoners named 
above are fully respected. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, this can only 
mean that the death penalty is not executed until all concerns the Special Rapporteurs have raised 
are dispelled in their entirety, or the above named men are given a new trial or released. 
</p>
<p>265. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs expressed their particular concern with regard to reports 
that one of the defendants sentenced to death on 17 August 2008, Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al 
Dar Adam, is only 17 years old.  
</p>
<p>266. The Special Rapporteurs drew the attention of the Government to the fact that Article 37(a) 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Sudan is a Party, expressly provides that 
capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 77 
</p>
<p>of age. In addition, Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which Sudan is a Party as well, provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes 
committed by persons below eighteen years of age.  
</p>
<p>267. According to the information the Special Rapporteurs received, the court accepted that 
Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam was a minor but sentenced him to death in spite of his 
age on the ground that the offences he was found guilty of included a hudud offence 
(brigandage). This would be in accordance with Article 36(2) of the Interim National 
Constitution and Article 27 of the 1991 Criminal Act, which prohibit the death penalty for 
offences committed by minors when it would be imposed as ta&#8217;azir penalty, but allow it for qisas 
and hudud offences. In this regard, the Special Rapporteurs must stress that, for the purposes of 
the Government&#8217;s obligation under international law, the distinction between hudud, ta&#8217;azir and 
qisas offences is immaterial. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
Article 6(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights apply &#8211; and bind the 
Government &#8211; irrespective of this distinction in the law of the Sudan.  
</p>
<p>268. Please explain the current situation of the prisoners who were found to be minors by the 
counter-terrorism courts and whose re-trial by juvenile courts was ordered by the 
counter-terrorism courts. Where are they currently detained? Does your Government intend to 
bring them to trial? Do they have legal counsel defending them and does such legal counsel have 
access to them? Is it accurate that there are other children apprehended after the JEM attack and 
not charged who are still held at a detention facility near Al Jeili? Please explain the appeals and 
other challenges against the judgment and sentence open to the defendants sentenced by 
counter-terrorism courts on 17 and 20 August 2008, including ex gratia proceedings. Please 
explain what specific acts the defendants were found guilty of beyond participation in an armed 
uprising. Which acts the defendants engaged in were found by the court to constitute &#8220;terrorist 
acts&#8221; for the purposes of Articles 5 and 6 of the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act?

<p>270. On 16 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a communication to the Government advising that they have been 
approached by third parties in the case of <b>Adel Abdul Hakim</b>, an ethnic Uyghur from China, 
who they understand is already physically present in Sweden. In relation to the specific case of 
Mr. Hakim and to the resettlement of other Guantanamo Bay detainees, in appropriate cases, we 
the Special Rapporteurs would like to encourage the practice of other countries to facilitate 
resettlement, including direct participation in the process by being a receiver country in order to 
create a resettlement framework in conformity with human rights.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>273. The Special Rapporteur received updated information that Mr. Hakim&#8217;s appeal regarding 
his asylum claim was heard on 21 January 2009. On 18 February 2009 the Swedish Migration 
Court of Stockholm granted his appeal to reside in Sweden ruling that he was exceptionally 
deserving of humanitarian protection in Sweden. 
</p>
<p><b>Thailand 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communications sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>274. On 13 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government 
regarding the draft &#8216;<b>Internal Security Act</b>&#8217;, described, in part, as a measure against terrorism. 
According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, the draft &#8216;Internal Security Act&#8217; 
(ISA) was approved in principle by the National Legislative Council on 8 November 2007. 
Afterwards, a 24-member committee was set up to complete vetting of the draft law within seven 
days. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention 
to several main substantive areas of concern relating to the draft provisions. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view these aspects of the draft Act are incompatible with international standards 
and may, if applied, lead to serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>275. Section 14 prescribes that this draft Act should be applicable if a matter arises that &#8220;affects 
internal security but which does not yet require the declaration of a state of emergency&#8221; and may 
&#8220;persist for a long time&#8221;. Thus, the draft explicitly specifies that the Act should be applicable in 
situations that do not amount to a state of emergency. As a result, the Act would have a scope of 
application that is ill-defined and relates neither to a situation of normalcy nor to a state of 
emergency. Furthermore, the terms &#8220;affects internal security&#8221; is overly broad and could also be 
applied in minor circumstances that affect order and security in Thailand. Likewise, the term 
&#8220;persist for a long time&#8221; is a vague term, in particular with a view to the significant human rights 
restrictions that can be imposed as a consequence of the Act. Therefore, both terms raise 
concerns as to legal certainty. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 79 
</p>
<p>276. Furthermore, section 17 vests the power in the director of the Internal Security Operations 
Command (ISOC) to issue orders for &#8220;government officials to implement any action, or withhold 
the implementation of any action&#8221; to prevent, suppress, stop or rectify any situation that affects 
internal security as designated under article 14. Two main concerns should be raised in this 
context. First, the powers given to ISOC, such as the responsibility for commanding government 
officials, would put the civilian administration under military command. Among other 
international bodies, the General Assembly has consistently called upon states to strengthen the 
rule of law by ensuring that the military remains accountable to a democratically elected civilian 
government (see e.g. resolution 56/96 &#8220;Promoting and consolidating democracy&#8221; of 
4 December 2000, para. 1 (c) (ix). Second, given its broad wording, section 17 may be used as a 
blanket power overriding important constitutional safeguards for the protection of human rights. 
In this context, it should be noted that freedom of expression, assembly, association and 
movement can be restricted according to section 17. This provision, however, omits specifying 
appropriate limits applicable to such restrictions. It should be enshrined in the Act that such 
measures may only be taken when they are considered necessary, suitable and proportionate in 
the individual case ensuring that they are strictly required by the exigencies of the actual 
situation. Furthermore, the clause does not specify a time frame for such significant restrictions 
to apply. 
</p>
<p>277. Under section 18, the director of the Internal Security Operations Command and any 
official designated by the director shall be &#8220;an investigating officer according to the Code of 
Procedure for Criminal Investigation&#8221;. While not proclaiming the state of emergency, this 
provision therefore enables the ISOC director to undertake criminal investigations, thus 
replacing the investigation authorities as designated under constitutional provisions. 
Furthermore, it is not clear whether significant safeguards, as enshrined in constitutional 
provisions and in the Criminal Procedure Code, such as the principles of judicial oversight and 
due process, apply in this context.  
</p>
<p>278. Section 19 vests the power in the ISOC director to send a person suspected of an offense to 
undergo training at a designated place for a period not exceeding six months &#8220;in place of court 
proceedings&#8221;. According to article 9, para. 1, of the ICCPR, everyone has the right to liberty of 
the person and no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. According to article 9, 
para. 3, of the ICCPR, anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought 
promptly before a judge and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time, or release. The 
right to challenge the lawfulness of one&#8217;s detention before a court is provided by article 9, 
para. 4, of the ICCPR. The Human Rights Committee confirmed in its General Comment 29 of 
2001 that this right is protected at all times. This is partly because of the crucial role of 
procedural guarantees in securing compliance with the non-derogable right under article 7 of the 
ICCPR not to be subjected to torture or any other form of inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment. 
Moreover, section 19 of the Act contradicts article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR) which prescribes in its para. 1 (2) &#8220;In the determination of any criminal 
charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a 
fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.&#8221; 
Empowering the ISOC director to send persons to undergo &#8220;training&#8221; deprives these individuals 
of their rights under the above mentioned articles of the ICCPR. Moreover, safeguards under the 
criminal justice system may be completely circumvented by this provision. Furthermore, </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 80 
 
</p>
<p>section 19 does not specify where and under whose authority (military or civilian) it such 
training will be conducted. Thus, significant human rights violations such as arbitrary and 
incommunicado detention in undisclosed or inaccessible places may occur. 
</p>
<p>279. Section 22 states that actions under the ISA are not subject to the law on administrative 
procedures and the law on the establishment of the Administrative Court. Given that the 
Administrative Court is the main body addressing human rights violations committed by state 
officials in Thailand, the removal of this jurisdiction may lead to a complete denial of 
responsibility while in official function and even impunity. It should be noted that the concerns 
outlined above may gravely endanger the principle of the separation of powers in general and the 
independence of the judiciary in particular. 
280. Finally, the draft Act does not specify the composition of the ISOC. Given the above 
mentioned broad powers of the ISOC, this omission is of grave concern. This concern is not 
mitigated by the fact that under section 9 of the draft Act an Internal Security Operations Board 
is given the power to oversee, consult and make proposals to the ISOC with respect to actions 
taken according to the Act. Since this Board is mainly composed of governmental and law 
enforcement officials, the requirement of democratic accountability is not complied with.  
</p>
<p>281. In summary, while the Special Rapporteur affirmed that he is fully conscious of the need to 
take effective measures to prevent and counter terrorism, and of the difficulties of States in doing 
so, he was seriously concerned that many provisions of the draft &#8220;Internal Security Act&#8221; are not 
in accordance with international human rights standards as well as national constitutional and 
other legal provisions. He urged the executive and legislative branches of government in 
Thailand to reconsider the draft &#8216;Internal Security Act&#8217; and called upon both branches to allow 
for further debate and consider a complete overhaul of this draft due to concerns that the 
implementation of this law could have a significant negative impact on human rights in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>282. On 20 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government of 
Thailand regarding the <b>Emergency Decree on Government Administration in States of 
Emergencies (the Decree)</b>, enacted on 15 July 2005 reportedly by a decision of the Prime 
Minister without being submitted to the Parliament. The Decree allows the Prime Minister to 
declare a state of emergency, inter alia in situations resulting from an offence relating to 
terrorism (Section 4) and a &#8220;serious state of emergency&#8221; where an emergency situation involves 
terrorism (Section 11). On the basis of this Decree, a state of emergency was declared in three 
southern provinces. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, this Decree raises five substantive 
issues of concern.  
</p>
<p>283. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first concern related to the definition of a &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; 
and of a &#8220;serious state of emergency&#8221; in Sections 4 and 11 of the Decree. Section 4 of the Decree 
describes a state of emergency as &#8220;a situation which affects or may affect public order or 
endangers the security of the State or may cause the country or any part of the country to fall into 
a state of acute difficulty or a situation resulting from an offence relating to terrorism under the 
Penal Code, armed conflict or war&#8221; pursuant to which it is necessary to enact emergency 
measures to &#8220;preserve the monarchy, the democratic system of government under the 
constitutional monarchy, national independence, the interests of the nation, compliance with the 
law, the safety of the people, the peaceful way of life of the people, the protection of rights, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 81 
</p>
<p>liberties and public order or public interest, or the aversion or provision of remedy for damages 
arising from urgent and severe public calamity&#8221;. Section 11 gives power to the Prime Minister, 
upon the approval of the Council of Ministers, to declare a serious state of emergency, where a 
situation involves &#8220;use of force, harm to life, body or property, or there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that there exist acts of violence which affect the security of the State, the safety of life or 
property of the State or person (&#8230;)&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>284. Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which 
Thailand is a party, states that derogations from the Covenant are permissible only in times of 
public emergency which threaten the life of a nation. It is my opinion that the definitions 
contained in the Decree are overly broad and vague, and may therefore allow for the declaration 
of a state of emergency in cases which do not amount to a threat to the life of the nation, and 
which should therefore be dealt with under the ordinary legal framework, without derogating 
from the ICCPR. The Human Rights Committee has noted the exceptional and temporary nature 
of the measures derogating from the Covenant which must be limited to the extent strictly 
required by the exigencies of the situation (Human Rights Committee, general comment 29, 
para. 2-4), and has highlighted the importance of ensuring that courts monitor compliance with 
article 4 of the Covenant (CCPR/C/79/Add.76, para. 38 and CCPR/C/79/Add.56, para. 13). The 
Special Rapporteur recommended that the Decree be amended to narrow the scope of application 
of a &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; and a &#8220;serious state of emergency&#8221; to encompass only those situations 
which are covered by Article 4 of the ICCPR. In addition, the decree should provide for 
parliamentary control over the initiation and termination of a state of emergency, the 
enumeration of rights that may be derogated from and the safeguards that should accompany 
those derogations to ensure that the principles of proportionality and necessity are respected, as 
well as for judicial control to review the compliance of a declaration of a state of emergency, and 
any measures taken pursuant to it, with Article 4 of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 82 
 
</p>
<p>287. The third series of concerns related to the issue of arrest and detention. Section 11(1) states 
that a &#8220;competent official&#8221; may have the &#8220;power of arrest and detention of a person suspected of 
having a role in causing the emergency situation, or being an instigator, making the propagation, 
a supporter of such act or concealing relevant information relating to the act which caused the 
state of emergency, provided that this should be done to the extent that is necessary to prevent 
such a person from committing an act or participating in the commission of any act which may 
cause a serious situation (&#8230;)&#8221;. In addition, while Section 12 provides that &#8220;in arresting and 
detaining suspected persons under Section 11(1), the competent official shall apply for leave of 
the court&#8221;, it is unclear whether the individual must be physically brought before the Court and 
what elements the judicial authority has at its disposal to review the legality of the detention. 
This provision allows for detention for seven days, with possible extensions up to a maximum of 
30 days. Finally, this section notes that the suspected persons shall be detained in a designated 
place which is not a police station, detention centre, penal institution or prison.  
</p>
<p>288. According to article 9 (1) of the ICCPR, everyone has the right to liberty of the person and 
no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. According to article 9 (3) of the ICCPR, 
anyone arrested or detained on criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge and 
shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable amount of time or release. The right to challenge the 
lawfulness of one&#8217;s detention before a court is provided by article 9 (4) of the ICCPR. The 
Human Rights Committee confirmed in its General Comment 29 of 2001 that this right is 
protected at all times, including during a state of emergency. This is partly because of the crucial 
role of procedural guarantees in securing compliance with the non-derogable right under article 7 
of the ICCPR not to be subjected to torture or any other form of inhuman, cruel or degrading 
treatment. The Commission on Human Rights, in its Resolution 2005/39 of 19 April 2005 
(Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) reminded all States 
that: &#8220;9. (&#8230;) prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in 
itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person&#8221;. This statement highlights the 
importance of procedural safeguards, such as access to counsel, effective judicial review of any 
form of detention, and personal appearance before a judge, for the protection of the rights 
enshrined in articles 7 and 10 of the ICCPR. Finally, the Human Rights Committee noted, in 
relation to the length of detention under the Decree that detention without external safeguards 
beyond 48 hours should be prohibited (CCPR/CO/84/THA, para. 13). 
</p>
<p>289. The Special Rapporteur was concerned that the grounds for arrest and detention, which 
may lead to the preventive arrest and detention of individuals who have a very remote link to the 
security situation, the absence of limitation regarding who the &#8220;competent official&#8221; might be, the 
length of detention under the emergency decree and the use of unofficial places of detention are 
at variance with Article 9 of the ICCPR. In particular, the Special Rapporteur has received 
information regarding continued enforced disappearances in the south, which is a very serious 
concern.  
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 83 
</p>
<p>without delay the lawfulness of one&#8217;s detention before a court. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur recommended that the period of detention in the law be brought in line with the 
recommendation of the Human Rights Committee and that detentions take place solely in 
recognized places of detention.  
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1

</p>
<p>and movement, and recommend that the Government amend them to limit their scope, and 
ensure parliamentary and judicial review, to ensure that the principles of necessity and 
proportionality are respected.  
</p>
<p>296. On 11 November 2008 the Special Rapporteur requested an official visit to Thailand. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>297. On 15 February 2008, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence 
of 13 November 2007 and advised that during the months of November and December 2007, the 
said ISA draft had gone through various revisions and changes by NLA Committee members, 
taking into account the concerns expressed by various stakeholders, the civil society and 
international organizations. On 20 December 2007, the then NLA approved the Internal Security 
Act with 105 votes in favour, eight against and two abstentions. The general objectives of the 
said Act are to prevent threats to internal security, issue early warnings to the public about 
potential security threats and provide remedies to the affected population. According to the said 
Act, the Internal Security Operation Command (ISOC) will be under civilian command and the 
ISOC Committee will be chaired by the Prime Minister. With regard to some of your specific 
concerns in the initial draft of the said Act, many issues have been overtaken by subsequent 
developments and have already been addressed by the NLA Committee members such as the 
deletion of Article 22.  
</p>
<p>298. The Government provided some general information on Thailand&#8217;s Internal Security Act. 
Thailand remains fully committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of her people. Nevertheless, in coping with the increasing challenges of 
unconventional threats to security in the present era, the Royal Thai Government, like many 
other governments from both developing and developed nations, has worked hard to maintain a 
delicate balance between guaranteeing internal security for its citizens and upholding human 
rights principles. Thailand&#8217;s Internal Security Act is aimed at addressing such new 
non-traditional threats that are complex and require a proper authority to solve security problems 
in an effective and efficient manner. In brief, the said Act has been created to prevent threats to 
internal security, issue early warnings to the public about potential security threats and provide 
remedies to the affected population. On 20 December 2007, the then National Legislative 
Assembly (NLA) of Thailand (before the general election on 23 December 2007) approved the 
Internal Security Act with 105 votes in favour, eight against and two abstentions. The said 
legislation had previously been revised by NLA Committee members from its initial draft, taking 
into serious consideration the concerns expressed by the civil society and various international 
organizations. The Government also made specific references to some provisions of the Internal 
Security Act.  
</p>
<p>299. The Structure of the Internal Security Operation Command (ISOC): Article 5 of the said 
Act inscribes the Prime Minister, as Head of Government, to hold the position of ISOC Director. 
Under Article 9, the ISOC Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister or the assigned Deputy 
Prime Minister and includes, among others, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Thailand. Therefore, ISOC would be under civilian command. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 85 
</p>
<p>and involvement of people from a wide range of sectors comprising, at least, eminent persons or 
experts having experience in political science, public administration, law, science and 
technology, rights and freedom protection, problem solving through peaceful means, national 
security maintenance and media. The advisory group is required to recommend approaches to 
problem solution or threat prevention as well as provide needed advice asked by the ISOC 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>301. Controlling and Monitoring the Use of Power by ISOC: The Internal Security Act contains 
articles that instruct the Cabinet and the National Parliament to closely control and monitor the 
use of power by ISOC. For instance, Article 14 stipulates that any use of power by the ISOC to 
prevent, suppress, suspend, prohibit and solve or mitigate situations affecting internal security 
has to seek a Cabinet approval before implementation. In addition, the Cabinet needs to set a 
specific area and time period in which the ISOC can use such assigned power and announce this 
information to the public. Once the situation has ceased or is capable of being solved by the 
power and duties of normal responsible authorities, the Prime Minister must announce publicly 
that the assigned use of power by ISOC is no longer enforced. The Prime Minister must then 
report the result to both Houses of Representatives and the Senate at the earliest opportunity. 
Article 17, specifies that the issuance of any regulations, such as prohibitions to enter or leave 
any area, to carry any weapon out of residence, to use any road, or to implement or not 
implement any instrument or electronic equipment in order to prevent any danger to life and 
people&#8217;s property, should not create any inappropriate difficulties for citizens. Moreover, such 
prohibitions should receive Cabinet approval. 
</p>
<p>302. Remedies for any damage: Article 19 prescribes that if the utilization of the ISOC&#8217;s power 
causes any damages to innocent citizens, the ISOC should arrange to provide appropriate 
remedies or compensation to the affected people according to the criteria and conditions set up 
by the Cabinet. 
</p>
<p>303. Judicial issues: The Internal Security Act also allows for the usage of reconciliatory justice 
or rehabilitation measures. For example, Article 19 indicates that if there is a case of any 
convicted person who turns himself/herself to any official in charge or if any investigating 
officer finds that such convicted person has committed an offense from wrong judgment and if 
an attorney files this case to the Court, the Court may issue an order for the said convicted person 
to be sent to the ISOC Director to receive training in a specified place for no more than 6 months 
and follow any other required conditions of the Court instead of serving his/her sentence. 
However, such a procedure has to be accepted by the said convicted person. Article 21 (2) 
provides that the prosecution of any case as a result of regulations, announcements, instructions 
or use of power by an officer in charge is subject to the judicial power of the Court of Justice. 
The said Internal Security Act has already deleted Article 22 which is related to the issue of 
&#8220;impunity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>304. On 27 November 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government 
of Turkey regarding a case against the <b>Democratic Society Party</b>, opened by the state 
prosecutor. The prosecutor has reportedly instituted proceedings to close down this political </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1

</p>
<p>party and to expel its eight parliamentarians to lose their Member of Parliament status. The case 
is going to be decided by the Constitutional Court. According to the information received, the 
grounds for closing down the party are related to allegations that it would be taking 
&#8220;instructions&#8221; from the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) A. &#214;calan and 
that its expressed political positions would represent allegiance with a terrorist organization 
(PKK) and its leader A. &#214;calan.  
</p>
<p>305. While being conscious of the fact that States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote human 
rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism, the Special Rapporteur 
underlined that General Assembly resolution 59/191, in its paragraph 1, stresses that: &#8220;States 
must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under 
international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;, as do 
Security Council resolutions 1456 (2003) and 1624 (2005) in paragraphs 6 and 4 respectively. 
Article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides for the 
right to freedom of association with others, is part of these obligations. Article 22 allows for no 
restrictions &#8220;other than those which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a 
democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre 
public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of 
others&#8221;. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur referred the Government to the right to participate 
in the conduct of public affairs, enshrined in article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which emphasizes that every citizen shall have this right without unreasonable 
restrictions.  
</p>
<p>306. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur drew the attention of the Government to 
paragraphs 26 to 33 of his report on the visit to Turkey (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2) as well as 
paragraphs 9 to 28 of my report to the General Assembly in 2006 (A/61/267). 
</p>
<p>307. The Special Rapporteur underlined the importance of the rights enshrined in articles 22 
and 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in a democratic society and 
the need to define terrorism through the choice of inexcusable tactics of violence against 
innocent bystanders. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, sharing common political goals with a 
terrorist organization does not transform a political party to a terrorist organization. Quite on the 
contrary, the choice of peaceful and political methods to further its freely chosen aims 
demonstrates that a political party is not a terrorist organization.  
</p>
<p>308. What is the status of the proceedings against the Democratic Society Party? Does the 
Government have a position in respect of the prosecutor&#8217;s case and will the Government express 
that position in public and to the Constitutional Court? In light of the importance of Article 25 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its pivotal role in a democratic 
society, please indicate whether the case against the Democratic Society Party gives rise to the 
Government initiating amendments to the legislation. 
</p>
<p>309. On 3 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government of 
Turkey regarding information received on 13 November 2008 that <b>six children</b> will face trial in 
the Diyarbakir Criminal Court on charges of propaganda for a terrorist organization and of 
terrorist crimes committed through the throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails on the police 
during a demonstration. The Prosecutor of the court has asked for a prison penalty of 23 years 
for the accused, who are reported to be 13-14 years old. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 87 
</p>
<p>310. In connection with the information referred to above, the Special Rapporteur takes the 
view that each criminal justice system should adequately take into account the special needs and 
protections required when dealing with minor offenders, including those suspected of terrorism. 
This is so in order to avoid the risk of negatively influencing children&#8217;s reintegration in society, 
or even being counter-productive to the effect of pushing young persons into the ranks of 
terrorist organizations. He recalls relevant articles of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political rights (ICCPR) and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), both of which 
Turkey is a party to. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>311. On 28 December 2007, the Government of Turkey sent a reply to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
correspondence advising that the Chief Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation has indeed filed an 
indictment against DTP [Democratic Society Party &#8220;Demokratik Toplum Partisi&#8221;, DTP], which 
has been submitted to the Constitutional Court. The case is underway. Therefore, in accordance 
with the universal principle of the independence of the judiciary, it would not be possible to 
express an opinion with respect to an ongoing case as such. 
</p>
<p><b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>312. On 11 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government 
regarding <b>Counter-Terrorism Bill 2007-08</b> (henceforth the Bill) which was recently introduced 
before the House of Commons. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur would like to draw the 
Government&#8217;s attention to the following main area of continuing concern. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 88 
 
</p>
<p>316. According to section 41 (3) of the Terrorism Act 2000, after 48 hours, a judicial warrant is 
required to keep a suspected terrorist in detention without charge. The Special Rapporteur noted 
from your letter of 27 July 2006 that applications for warrants to extend extension beyond 
48 hours may be made for periods of seven days at a time and up to a maximum period of 
28 days from the time of the arrest. Furthermore, the Government informed the Special 
Rapporteur that a judicial authority can only issue a warrant if satisfied that there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that the further extension is necessary to obtain relevant evidence whether by 
questioning or otherwise or to preserve relevant evidence, and that the investigation in 
connection with which the person is detained is being conducted diligently and expeditiously 
(Schedule 8, paragraph 32 of the Terrorism Act 2000).  
</p>
<p>317. According to the proposed provisions of the Bill, warrants authorizing a detention beyond 
the 14-day period to up to 42 days can only be made by a senior judge. According to 
paragraph 43 (1) of the Bill in conjunction with Schedule 8, paragraphs 31 and 33, of the 
Terrorism Act 2000, suspects have the right to be notified of the application of a warrant of 
extended detention and the right to make presentations to the judge. There is, however, the 
possibility for the judge to exclude the detainee or his representative from any part of the 
hearing. No reasons for such exclusion are contained in the provisions. 
</p>
<p>318. An effective judicial review during the on-going detention would not only require the court 
to examine the compliance with the requirements, as set out in Schedule 8, paragraph 32 of the 
Terrorism Act 2000. Most importantly, the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the 
detention and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by continued detention need to be examined. 
In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the applicable judicial safeguards, as contained in Schedule 8 
of the Terrorism Act 2000, do not satisfy these criteria. Therefore, and taking into account the 
limited scope of separate habeas corpus review, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that an 
individual, detained as terrorist suspect under these provisions, will lack an actual possibility of 
release by judicial decision.  
319. Furthermore, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, the fact that the suspect has not been 
informed of his/her charges, and as a consequence may not be well aware of the evidence against 
him/her, may in practice prevent the suspect from contesting in a well-founded manner the 
lawfulness of his/her continued detention, the more if absent during the hearing. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to article 9 paragraph 2 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prescribes that &#8220;[a]nyone who is arrested shall be 
informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of any 
charges against him&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur sees this principle as a pre-requisite to the full 
enjoyment of the right under article 9 paragraph 4 of the ICCPR, according to which any person 
subject to arrest or detention has the right to challenge without delay the lawfulness of one&#8217;s 
detention before a court. The Human Rights Committee confirmed in its General Comment 29 of 
2001 that the right to court review over the lawfulness of any form of detention is protected at all 
times, including during a state of emergency. 
</p>
<p>320. As a consequence, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the scope of judicial review, 
as contained in Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000, needs to be broadened so as to secure the 
right to contest the substantive grounds of detention and a real possibility of release. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur remains of the opinion that judicial review of the necessity 
of the detention should be conducted more often than once per week.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 89 
</p>
<p>321. It is with great regret that the Special Rapporteur had to observe that the proposed 
provision on the temporary extension of pre-charge detention to 42 days, if approved and 
implemented, may amount to a <i>de facto</i> state of emergency power, without, however, requiring 
that the situation is &#8220;threatening of the life of the nation&#8221;, as prescribed in article 4 paragraph 1 
of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>322. Furthermore, it is the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view that the inclusion of provisions on a 
mechanism of parliamentary oversight, i.e. authorization by the legislature of extended 
pre-charge detention, may end up undermining the potentials of an effective judicial review in 
individual cases. Safeguards against the deprivation of liberty, and particularly against arbitrary 
arrest and detention, have explicitly been conferred upon the judicial branch in order to prevent 
any political influence to be exerted. It remains also questionable whether the legislative branch 
is well equipped to consider individual cases, in particular in light of the fact that this procedure 
may prejudice any criminal proceedings that might result from the investigation. Furthermore, by 
the time both Houses express views on whether the extended detention will be authorized, the 
maximum period of 42 days may have already expired.  
</p>
<p>323. Finally, the Special Rapporteur fears that the proposed provision of an extended 42 days of 
pre-charge detention, if adopted and implemented, will prompt other Member States to simply 
copy this period without, however, reflecting on the importance of effective judicial review. In 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with 
its long-standing history of effective protection of human rights, should not been seen as a 
country encouraging other Member States to lower the respective key standards. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore urged for further debate in relation to the aspects mentioned above in order 
to assure full compliance with international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>324. On 9 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government of the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland referring to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
earlier correspondence and consultations with the Government, and in particular his letter of 
11 March 2008 and the response of 24 April 2008. The Special Rapporteur appreciated the 
response by the Government and was grateful for its cooperation and invitation for further 
consultations and expressed his willingness to engage in such consultations. The Special 
Rapporteur nevertheless expressed his position in a matter that requires immediate attention. The 
Special Rapporteur understands that the House of Commons is scheduled to vote on the 
<b>Counter-Terrorism Bill 2007-08</b> (hereafter the Bill) on the 11 June 2008. While the Special 
Rapporteur welcomed the consideration of amendments of 3 June 2008, he appealed to the 
Government to withdraw the Bill or to postpone a definitive decision on it. 
</p>
<p>325. There were two reasons for this request. Firstly, despite the ongoing dialogue the Special 
Rapporteur believes that in order to secure compliance with international human rights standards 
the scope of judicial review, as contained in Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act 2000, needs to be 
broadened so as to secure the right to contest the substantive grounds of detention and a real 
possibility of release. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur referred to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 9, paragraph 4.  
</p>
<p>326. Secondly, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interaction with other governments and civil society 
actors in various parts of the world gives rise to a strong concern that the proposed power in the 
extension of pre-charge detention to 42 days, if adopted and implemented will prompt other </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 90 
 
</p>
<p>states to simply copy either the provision or the detail of 42 days into their own 
counter-terrorism laws without reflecting on the importance of effective judicial review. In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with its 
long-standing history of effective protection of human rights, should not take any measures that 
would in fact encourage other states to lower the respective key standards regarding detention 
and judicial review over it in the context of countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>327. On 24 April 2008 the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence 
of 11 March 2008, as follows:  
</p>
<p>328. The current pre-charge detention legislation:<b> </b>As you know, the existing UK legislation that 
governs the detention of terrorist suspects is contained in Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000. 
Anyone arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 can be detained by the police for 
48 hours after which an application for a warrant of further detention needs to be made to a 
designated district judge. The legislation therefore provides that the detention of any person 
beyond 48 hours must be approved by a judge and that any period of further detention is limited 
to a maximum of 7 days at a time. The permanent maximum limit of pre-charge detention is 
14 days with the 28-day limit needing to be agreed annually by Parliament. The Crown 
Prosecution Service (CPS) is responsible for making all applications for extensions between 14 
and 28 days. The CPS will only make an application for continued detention if considers that it is 
necessary and appropriate to do so. Extension hearings are closed to the public and media but are 
attended by the judge, police, the CPS and (subject to the judge&#8217;s right to exclude them from any 
part of the hearing) detained person and their legal representative. For applications beyond 
14 days, the application must be heard by a High Court judge. Applications for continued 
detention are usually strenuously contested and consideration can last many hours. The 
investigating officer may be questioned by the defence solicitor. The judge may issue a warrant 
of further detention only if he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the 
further detention of the person to whom the application relates is necessary to obtain or preserve 
relevant evidence and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. If 
the judge is not satisfied that further detention is necessary then the suspect would need to be 
released. 
</p>
<p>329. Extension of the pre-charge detention to a maximum of 42 days:<b> </b>The proposal in 
Schedule 1 to the Counter-Terrorism Bill would enable the pre-charge detention period to be 
increased beyond 28 days in future if there is a clear and exceptional need to do so. The higher 
limit could only remain in force for a strictly limited period of time of 60 days. We believe a 
reserve power to extend the pre-charge detention limit to 42 days in future is needed 
for 2 reasons. First, the need to intervene early in some terrorist investigations and second, the 
growing scale and complexity of terrorist investigations. In much police work, the investigation 
takes place after a crime has been committed. In such cases there will often be a victim, possible 
suspects, witnesses to the crime and forensic material from the crime scene. The police will 
investigate the crime and arrest the suspect when they already have a considerable amount of 
admissible evidence and only a few days may be needed to question the suspect before a 
decision is taken on whether to charge them for an offence. Terrorism cases are different. 
Because of the severe consequences of a terrorist attack, the police and Security Service need to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 91 
</p>
<p>intervene before it takes place. Critically, they may need to intervene at a very early stage in an 
investigation - before they have had the opportunity to gather any admissible evidence and on the 
basis of limited intelligence about who and what is involved.  
</p>
<p>330. That is why UK legislation has since 2000 provided specific powers of arrest and detention 
in relation to terrorism. The second factor that needs to be taken into account, is the growing 
scale and complexity of terrorist investigations. Since 2000 it has become clear that the plots 
which the police are involved in investigating are growing in size (in terms of numbers of 
suspects involved, amount of material that needs to be analysed and the number of international 
connections involved) and complexity (in particular in relation to the use of computer 
technology). To illustrate how the nature and scale of terrorism has changed, it might be useful 
to provide some examples. In 2001 the police investigated the last major IRA case, in which they 
had to analyse the content of one computer and a handful of floppy disks. The suspects used their 
own names and their activities were confined to the Republic of Ireland and the UK. In 2004, the 
police and the Security Services had to investigate Dhiren Barot, the key conspirator in an 
Al-Qaeda operation in this country. This case lead to the seizure of some 270 computers, 2000 
computer discs and a total of 8224 exhibits. There were seven co-conspirators and during the 
investigation police carried out enquiries in the USA, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, France, 
Spain and Sweden. In another very recent case, 30 addresses were searched within two hours of 
the start of the arrest phase of the operation. 400 computers and 8000 computer discs were seized 
with over 25,000 exhibits in total. This trend towards larger and more complex operations has 
meant that the police have had to hold a small number of suspects for the full 28 days in recent 
cases. Although there has not yet been a case where more than 28 days has been needed, the 
trend suggests that this might not remain the position in future. 
</p>
<p>331.  To address this future risk the Government is legislating to provide a reserve power which 
will enable a higher limit of 42 days to be made available in future where there is an exceptional 
need for it. If Parliament agrees to the proposal to legislate on a contingency basis, then the 
reserve power could only be brought into force in certain circumstances set out in statute. The 
Home Secretary could only make the higher limit available after receiving a joint report from the 
Director of Public Prosecutions and the police setting out their reasonable grounds for believing 
that more than 28 days will be required to obtain, preserve or examine relevant evidence and 
stating that the investigation is being carried out diligently and expeditiously. If the Home 
Secretary was satisfied that there was an exceptional operational requirement to make the higher 
limit available (and made an order making the power available) he/she would be required to 
make a written statement to Parliament within 2 days of making the order or as soon as 
practicable. The written statement would need to state that the Home Secretary considers that the 
need for the higher limit was urgent and that it was ECHR compliant. The Home Secretary&#8217;s 
decision to make the higher limit available could be subject to judicial review. The Home 
Secretary would have no role in deciding on the detention of individual suspects which would 
continue to be approved by a judge and there would be the extra safeguard that the application 
for an extension beyond 28 days would require the approval of the DPP. A judge could approve 
the continued detention of a suspect only if he was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds 
for believing that further detention was necessary to obtain relevant evidence or to preserve 
relevant evidence, and that the investigation in connection with which the person was detained 
was being conducted diligently and expeditiously. If this test is not met, then the person would 
be released. The higher limit would cease to be available after a maximum of 60 days. In order to 
remain in force for the full 60 days, the Home Secretary&#8217;s decision to make the higher limit </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 92 
 
</p>
<p>available would need to be debated and approved by both Houses of Parliament within 30 days 
of it coming into force. If either House of Parliament did not approve the Home Secretary&#8217;s 
decision, the reserve power would cease to be available at midnight on the day of the debate. 
When the reserve power ceases to be available, all those detained under the power would need to 
be released immediately. The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation would report within 
6 months of the reserve power ceasing to be available. A parliamentary debate would take place 
on this report which would cover whether individual suspects were held in accordance with 
requirements governing detention, whether proper procedures were followed for applications for 
detention beyond 28 days and on the Home Secretary&#8217;s decision to make the higher limit 
available. The Government hopes that with the above explanation, that the Special Rapporteur 
will concur, that the mechanisms of oversight in place mean that the legislation would be fully 
compliant with the requirement in Article 9(3) of the ICCPR that such a person be &#8220;brought 
promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power&#8221;. 
332. Reasonableness of suspicion: In relation to your point about the reasonableness of the 
suspicion grounding the detention and the legitimacy of the purpose for continued detention, 
paragraph 32 of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000 sets out the grounds of which the judge 
must be satisfied before granting further detention. It states that a judicial authority may issue a 
warrant of further detention if there are reasonable grounds for believing that further detention is 
necessary to obtain relevant evidence or to preserve relevant evidence and that the investigation 
is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. If the judge is not satisfied that there are 
reasonable grounds for believing further detention is necessary, then he can refuse the 
application for extended detention. 
</p>
<p>333. Exclusion of a suspect:<b> </b>You ask under what circumstances a detainee or his representative 
may be excluded from a hearing of an extension application. There is a power under 
paragraph 33 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act for the judicial authority or judge hearing the 
application to exclude the detainee and his legal representative from any part of the hearing. This 
power is used to exclude those persons from any &#8216;closed&#8217; part of the application, where the 
applicant is relying on information which they reasonably believe would be harmful in one of a 
specified number of ways if disclosed to the detainee (set out in paragraph 34 of Schedule 8). 
These include hindering the gathering of evidence of terrorism offences, making the 
apprehension or prosecution of a terrorist suspect more difficult or making the prevention of an 
act of terrorism more difficult. However, the detainee and his legal representative are allowed to 
participate in the open part of the proceedings where the information presented to the court in 
support of the case for extension does not present such issues. 
</p>
<p>334. Parliamentary Oversight:<b> </b>We accept that it is vital not to prejudice future prosecutions but 
it is also important that the higher limit is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Therefore, in order 
for the higher limit to remain in force for the full 60 days, the Home Secretary&#8217;s decision to 
make it available would need to be debated and approved by both Houses of Parliament within 
30 days of it becoming available. However, it is not a matter for Parliament to discuss individual 
cases. In the Home Secretary&#8217;s report to Parliament the legislation makes clear that the report 
must not give the name of the detained person or contain any material that might prejudice a 
prosecution. There would therefore be no political involvement in the act of the detention of 
terrorist suspects. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 93 
</p>
<p>335. Informing suspects about charges:<b> </b>In response to your concern about the suspect not being 
informed about charges, it should be noted that the detained arrangements for the detention of 
terrorist suspects before charge are set out in statutory codes. These codes state that when a 
person is arrested, or further arrested, they should be informed at the time, or as soon after as 
practicable, that they are under arrest and the grounds for their arrest. It further states that a 
detained person should be provided with sufficient information to understand why they have 
been deprived of their liberty and the reason for their arrest. They should also be informed of the 
reason why arrest was necessary. However, in cases where arrest is based on sensitive 
information, it may not be possible to provide any more information than that an individual has 
been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of an 
act of terrorism. The same codes governing the detention of suspects would apply to any person 
held under the reserve power.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>336. State of emergency:<b> </b>We do not accept your suggestion that the proposed power amounts to 
a de facto state of emergency power without the requirement of proclaiming that there is a state 
of emergency in accordance with Article 4(1) of the ICCPR. The proposal allows for a 
temporary extension of the existing period of pre-charge detention by a further two weeks if 
there is an exceptional need. Your suggestion implies that our proposals derogate from our 
obligations under the Covenant. As explained above, we are confident that the safeguards in the 
proposal and in particular the requirement for judicial approval of detention at least every 7 days 
mean that the proposal is entirely compliant with our ICCPR (and ECHR) obligations. Finally, it 
should be noted that there has not been a case where the detention of a terrorist suspect being 
held under the existing maximum period of pre-charge detention has been found to be 
incompatible or unlawful. The UK believes that the extension of the period of pre-charge 
detention from 14 to 28 days in the Terrorism Act 2006, and the proposal in the 
Counter-Terrorism Bill enabling a temporary extension to the pre-charge detention limit in 
terrorist cases from the current 28 days to 42 days, are compatible with the requirements of the 
ICCPR. The Government is committed to ensuring that our existing and proposed 
counter-terrorism legislation is fully compliant with our obligations under international law and 
agreements and take care to ensure all states are aware of the great importance we place on 
complying with our international obligations. 
</p>
<p>337. On 28 October 2008, the Government sent a further letter to the Special Rapporteur, 
offering the following comments and responses: 
</p>
<p>338. Definition of terrorism: We believe that the current definition of terrorism that is contained 
in the Terrorism Act 2000 is both comprehensive and effective and there is no evidence that the 
broadness of the definition has caused problems in the way it has operated. As Lord Carlile of 
Berriew, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism, said in his report on the definition of terrorism, 
which was published in March 2007, &#8220;the current definition in the Terrorism Act 2000 is 
consistent with international comparators and treaties, and is useful and broadly fit for purpose&#8221;. 
You will wish to be aware that we are seeking to make a minor amendment to the definition of 
terrorism in the Counter-Terrorism Bill. This will add the word &#8220;racial&#8221; to the list of motivations 
included in the existing definition. We already believe that racially motivated terrorism is 
covered (because it will also be either ideologically or politically motivated) and therefore this 
change is purely for clarification. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 94 
 
</p>
<p>339. The current pre-charge detention legislation:<b> </b>As you may be aware, the existing UK 
legislation that governs the detention of terrorist suspects is contained in Schedule 8 to the 
Terrorism Act 2000. Anyone arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 can be 
detained by the police for 48 hours after which an application for a warrant of further detention 
needs to be made to a designated district judge. The legislation therefore provides that the 
detention of any person beyond 48 hours must be approved by a judge and that any period of 
further detention is limited to a maximum of 7 days at a time. The permanent maximum limit of 
pre-charge detention is 14 days with the 28-day limit needing to be agreed annually by 
Parliament. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is responsible for making all applications for 
extensions between 14 and 28 days. The CPS will only make an application for continued 
detention if considers that it is necessary and appropriate to do so. Extension hearings are closed 
to the public and media but are attended by the judge, police, the CPS and (subject to the judge&#8217;s 
right to exclude them from any part of the hearing) detained person and their legal 
representative. For applications beyond 14 days, the application must be heard by a High Court 
judge. Applications for continued detention are usually strenuously contested and consideration 
can last many hours. The investigating officer may be questioned by the defence solicitor. The 
judge may issue a warrant of further detention only if he is satisfied that there are reasonable 
grounds for believing that the further detention of the person to whom the application relates is 
necessary to obtain, preserve or analyse relevant evidence and that the investigation is being 
conducted diligently and expeditiously. If the judge is not satisfied as to either of these 
conditions then the suspect would need to be released.  
</p>
<p>340. Extension of the pre-charge detention to a maximum of 42 days: As you will be aware, the 
proposal to enable the pre-charge detention period to be increased to 42 days in future has now 
been removed from the Counter-Terrorism Bill. The maximum limit for pre-charge detention 
will therefore remain at 28 days (subject to this limit being agreed annually by Parliament). 
341. Informing suspects about charges: In response to your concern about the suspect not being 
informed about charges, it should be noted that the detailed arrangements for the detention of 
terrorist suspects before charge are set out in statutory codes. These codes state that when a 
person is arrested, or further arrested, they should be informed at the time, or as soon alter as 
practicable, that they are under arrest and the grounds for their arrest. It further states that a 
detained person should be provided with sufficient information to understand why they have 
been deprived of their liberty and the reason for their arrest. They should also be informed of the 
reason why arrest was necessary. However, in cases where arrest is based on sensitive 
information, it mat&#8217; not be possible to provide any more information than that an individual has 
been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of an 
act of terrorism. The same codes governing the detention of suspects would apply to any person 
held under the reserve power. 
</p>
<p>342. State of emergency:<b> </b>We do not accept your suggestion that any increase in the pre-charge 
detention limit beyond 28 days would have amounted to a de facto state of emergency power 
without the requirement of proclaiming that there is a state of emergency in accordance with 
Article 4(1) of the ICCPR. The proposal allowed for a temporary extension of the existing period 
of pre-charge detention by a further two weeks if there is an exceptional need. Your suggestion 
implies that our proposals would have derogated from our obligations under the Covenant. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 95 
</p>
<p>We are confident that the safeguards that were included in the proposal and in particular the 
requirement for judicial approval of detention at least every 7 days meant that the proposal was 
entirely compliant with our ICCPR (and ECHR) obligations. 
</p>
<p>343. Right to privacy: We share the view that State activity that impacts on a person&#8217;s privacy 
should be lawful and not arbitrary. It was in that light that the Government passed the Human 
Rights Act that enshrines into UK law the right to respect for private and family life; a right that 
may only be interfered with in accordance with the law and where it is necessary in a democratic 
society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the 
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the 
protection of the rights and freedoms of others and where it is proportionate. This approach is 
entirely in accordance with Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Furthermore, investigative techniques used by UK public authorities that might infringe 
upon a person&#8217;s privacy are governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. This 
legislation specifies in detail the precise circumstances in which the interference with privacy 
may take place. What information the intelligence and security agencies may obtain or disclose - 
whether or not it has come about by an infringement of privacy - is regulated by the agency&#8217;s 
governing legislation, that is, either the Security Service Act 1989 or Intelligence Services Act 
1994. There is also the Data Protection Act that regulates the general collection, use, storage and 
disclosure of personal information. The taking of fingerprints and samples is generally governed 
by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (and its Northern Ireland equivalent). The proposals in 
Part I of the Bill are set within this existing statutory framework. When considered from this 
viewpoint, one can see that there are strong safeguards in place to prevent any unlawful or 
arbitrary interference with the right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>344. Post-charge questioning: Post charge questioning of terrorist suspects is accompanied by a 
vide range of safeguards in primary legislation and compulsory codes of practice. The legislative 
safeguards include a requirement for authorisation of questioning by a police officer of at least 
the rank of superintendent (for the first 24 hour period) and subsequent authorisation by a Justice 
of the Peace up to a maximum of 5 days before a further application to a Justice of the Peace 
would need to be made. The Justice of the Peace could only authorise further questioning if they 
are satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice and that the police are conducting their 
investigation diligently and expeditiously. Post-charge questioning must also be video- recorded. 
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe codes further protect the rights of the 
suspect; for example they include an entitlement to legal representation during all questioning. If 
the questioning of a suspect alter charge was deemed by a court during a subsequent trial to be 
oppressive then the court could refuse to admit any evidence obtained under provisions in 
sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Therefore we believe that the 
post charge questioning provisions are compatible with Article 14 of International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>345. Coroners&#8217; inquests: You will be aware that the provisions on coroners&#8217; inquests have now 
been removed from the Counter-Terrorism Bill so that they can be considered as part of future 
legislation dealing with more general reform of the coronial system. </p>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Press statement by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>346. On 10 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press statement expressing 
concern over the UK counter-terrorism Bill.  
</p>
<p>347. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the adoption of the Counter-Terrorism Bill in the 
United Kingdom could set a negative precedent for upholding human rights in the context of 
countering terrorism. The House of Commons is scheduled to vote on the Bill on 11 June 2008 
which, despite recent amendments, contains a key provision to extend pre-charge detention of 
terrorist suspects to 42 days. The United Kingdom has a long standing history of effective human 
rights protection, however I am concerned that this Counter-Terrorism Bill, if adopted, could 
prompt other states to copy the provision into their own counter-terrorism legislation, without 
reflecting on the importance of effective judicial review. The Bill lowers key standards regarding 
detention in the context of countering terrorism. In particular, the Special Rapporteur believes 
the scope of judicial review needs to be broadened so as to secure the right of the accused to 
contest the substantive grounds of detention, and a real possibility of release. I welcome the 
ongoing dialogue between the Government and my mandate regarding the potential impact of 
these measures on human rights, but I appeal to the Government to withdraw the Bill or to 
postpone taking a definitive decision on it. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>348. 11 June 2008 the Bill passed the House of Commons. However, on 26 November 2008 
provisions of the Bill that related to the extension of pre-charge detention were defeated in the 
House of Lords. 
</p>
<p><b>United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>349. On 25 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent a 
communication regarding the situation of six non-US citizens currently detained at the military 
detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Mr. <b>Khalid Sheikh Mohammad</b>,<b> </b>Mr.<b> Mohammad 
al-Qahtani</b>,<b> </b>Mr.<b> Ramzi bin al-Shibh</b>,<b> </b>Mr.<b> Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali (a.k.a. Ammar al-Baluchi)</b>,<b> 
</b>Mr.<b> Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi</b>,<b> </b>and<b> </b>Mr.<b> Walid bin Attash (a.k.a. Khallad)</b>. The Special 
Rapporteurs were informed that, pursuant to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), all 
six will shortly be brought before military commissions on charges of conspiracy, murder in 
violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing 
serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, terrorism and 
providing material support for terrorism. 
</p>
<p>350. It is long overdue for Guantanamo Bay detainees allegedly responsible for or involved in 
the 9/11 attacks in the United States to be finally charged and prosecuted. However, in the 
Special Rapporteurs&#8217; view, the commissions established under the MCA lack the legal 
competence and procedural guarantees to conduct fair trials in accordance with international 
legal standards. This case highlights a number of concerns that have already been raised in the 
USA mission report of the Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 97 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/6/17/Add.<footnote name="3">65. Moreover, the trials are conducted based on the in-court reading of investigative 
summaries prepared by United States and Afghan officials which do not respect the principle of 
equality of the parties before the court. The use of evidence in this way, and the fact that the 
convictions can be based on it, may violate international standards, including the prohibited use 
of evidence obtained under torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or </footnote>) regarding the jurisdiction and composition of the military commissions, the 
use of evidence, the imposition of the death penalty for certain offences and shortcomings in 
securing a fair trial.   
</p>
<p>351. Firstly, there is a jurisdictional issue related to the MCA and the intention to try these six 
detainees before military commissions rather than courts. Among the charges that are awaiting 
the approval of the convening authority for the military commissions are the charges of 
terrorism, conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism that go beyond offences under 
the laws of war. This combined with the notion of &#8220;unlawful enemy combatant&#8221; may result in 
some of these detainees who are actually civilians being tried by military commissions. Another 
concern regarding the offences of terrorism, conspiracy, and providing material support for 
terrorism is that, to the extent they were not covered by the law applicable at the time of the 
commission of the actual acts and thus fall under the jurisdiction of US federal courts, the 
military commissions will be applying criminal law retroactively, in breach of article 15 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and universally acknowledged 
general principles of law.  
</p>
<p>352. Secondly, the Special Rapporteurs are concerned that, owing to their composition, the 
military commissions may lack independence and impartiality or the appearance thereof. The 
convening authority selects individual commission members for each trial and thus the 
appearance of an impartial selection is undermined. There is also the possibility of chains of 
command existing between members of the same commission which is a matter of concern. The 
ability of the convening authority to determine what charges will be referred to the military 
commissions and to have the authority to intervene during the negotiation of potential plea 
agreements is a serious concern as it gives a role to the executive to interfere before and during 
the proceedings.   
</p>
<p>353. On the issue of the use of the evidence, the Special Rapporteurs are concerned about 
allegations that some, or even all, of the six detainees have been subjected to highly abusive 
interrogation techniques that may have amounted to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment, equally prohibited under the non-derogable guarantees provided by article 7 of the 
ICCPR and under article 15 of the Convention against Torture. The domestic law definition of 
torture for the purpose of the proceedings before the military commission is restricted, not 
catching all forms of coercion that amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
equally prohibited under the non-derogable terms of the above named articles.  
</p>
<p>354. On 5 February 2008 Central Intelligence Agency Director-General Michael Hayden 
advised Congress that Mr. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad had been subjected to &#8220;waterboarding&#8221;. 
There is reportedly other evidence contained in interrogation logs that may confirm that some, or 
perhaps all, of the six detainees were subjected to abusive interrogation techniques, including 
stress positions and sleep deprivation. An even more worrying point is that the wording of the 
MCA allows testimony obtained through abusive interrogation techniques that were used prior to 
the Detainee Act of 2005 if such evidence is found to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; and its use &#8220;in the interests of 
justice&#8221;. This is contrary to the clear and well established principle of international law that 
excludes the use of evidence obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment for the 
purpose of trying and punishing a person.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
page 98 
 
</p>
<p>355. The Special Rapporteurs are further concerned about the use of evidence based on 
classified information and by the admission of hearsay evidence in proceedings before military 
commissions, in the form of a written summary of the evidence, if the military judges consider it 
to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; and &#8220;probative&#8221;. The admissibility of such evidence presents serious problems 
with regard to the right to fair trial since the accused is not secured the possibility of 
cross-examination of witnesses, as foreseen under article 14, paragraph 3 (e) of the ICCPR. If 
hearsay evidence was obtained through torture or coercion in respect of other persons and the 
interrogation techniques applied were themselves classified, the defendant would not know 
whether the evidence was obtained by such methods and therefore should be subject to a legal 
challenge.  
</p>
<p>356. Against this background the Special Rapporteurs wish to express our strong concern 
regarding the intention of the Government to request the death penalty regarding the six 
detainees on grounds of conspiracy and murder. The Special Rapporteurs consider that the 
proceedings governed by the MCA seriously undermine the right to a fair trial provided under 
article 14 of the ICCPR. Furthermore, the right to appeal is limited to matters of law. Thus, in the 
context of fair trial concerns this means that the imposition of the death penalty, in the event of a 
conviction or convictions by the military commission in this case, is likely to be in violation of 
Article 6 of the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p>357. The Special Rapporteurs would also like to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to article 15 
of the Convention against Torture which provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any 
statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made.&#8221; Furthermore, in paragraph 4 of Resolution 2005/39, the Commission on 
Human Rights has urged States to ensure that statements which are established to have been 
made under torture are not admitted as evidence.  
</p>
<p>358. As the Government is well aware, when the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism had the 
opportunity to observe hearings under the MCA at Guantanamo Bay in early December 2007, his 
observation of the actual proceedings and the institutional setting of the commissions provided 
further support to the concerns identified above. Despite the good intentions of the military 
judge, the hearings demonstrated a number of obstacles including the difficulty to call witnesses 
by the defence contrary to fair trial principles.  
</p>
<p>359. As a result of the various concerns raised in this letter pertaining to the military 
commissions the Special Rapporteurs urge the Government to repeal the Military Commissions 
Act of 2006 owing to its incompatibility with numerous articles of the ICCPR and to dissolve the 
commissions. The Special Rapporteurs further request that the case concerning these six 
detainees and any future cases of terrorist suspects be referred to competent courts established by 
law in conformity with international legal standards. 
</p>
<p>360. On 1 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent a communication to the Government concerning 
allegations related to <b>trials taking place in Afghanistan of detainees previously held in 
custody in the U.S. administered Bagram Theatre Internment Facility (BTIF), </b>as well as<b> </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/3/Add.1 
  page 99 
</p>
<p><b>detainees repatriated from Guant&#225;namo Bay Naval Base facilities to Afghanistan</b>. The 
Special Rapporteurs have also addressed a similar letter to the Government of Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>361. According to the information received, some of the individuals formerly detained by the 
United States Government at Guant&#225;namo Bay and Bagram have been, and continue to be, 
transferred to the Afghan National Detention Facility (ANDF) where they await prosecution.  
</p>
<p>362. This system of detention and transfer of detainees would seem to allow for prolonged 
detention in BTIF custody, and the prosecution and conviction of detainees without due 
consideration to legal requirements. Based on the information received, in the Special 
Rapporteurs&#8217; opinion, the system of detention and transfer of detainees fails to comply with fair 
trial international standards including the right to court review over any form of detention, the 
presumption of innocence, the right to defence and access to legal counsel and the right to be 
tried without undue delay as laid down in Articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides, inter alia, that &#8220;anyone who is arrested shall 
be informed, at the time of the arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and should be promptly 
informed of any charges against him&#8221; and that &#8220;everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public 
hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law&#8221;. According to the 
information received, many detainees, prior transfer to the ANDF were under United States 
custody without charge for several years. In addition, to date, trials of ANDF detainees lack 
many basic due process of law guarantees, including access to a lawyer while under investigation 
and adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defence.  
</p>
<p>363. With respect to trials and the evidence before the prosecution, the information the Special 
Rapporteurs received suggests that the United States Government provides the Afghan 
prosecution that investigates national security cases, with supposedly general and declassified 
versions of the Detainee Assessment Branch Reports of Investigation (ROIs), which typically 
state the date of capture, the capturing force and the detainee&#8217;s alleged actions. These ROIs then 
form the basis of the Afghan Government&#8217;s prosecution charges. However, this is done without 
any examination of individual witnesses or statements in the court dossier&#8212;sworn or unsworn, 
often United States personnel or officials involved in the capture and/or interrogation of the 
detainee. To date an estimated number of 303 detainees have been transferred from United States 
custody to the Government of Afghanistan. The National Directorate for Security has 
investigated some 201 cases. The situation of the other 102 detainees is not clear regarding the 
grounds for their detention, and concerning some of them having been detained for several 
months.  
</p>
<p>364. Furthermore, it was brought to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; attention that the default status for 
these detainees transferred to the ANDF is that of pre-trial detention until a judicial decision 
regarding their cases are taken. The Special Rapporteurs are concerned over the potential 
negative effects of the prolonged pre charge detention in Guantanamo Bay and BITF that may 
compromise the ability of the Government of Afghanistan to ensure a fair trial for these persons. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/10/3/Add.1

</p>
<p>punishment. The Afghan Constitution explicitly prohibits the introduction, as evidence, of 
statements obtained &#8220;by means of compulsion&#8221; and &#8220;recognizes a confession as voluntary only if 
taken before a judge.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to assure full compliance 
with the Afghan criminal procedure code and international fair trial standards included in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the ICCPR, including by requiring in-court 
witness testimony, and by allowing the defendant to challenge the evidence through 
cross-examination. The Special Rapporteurs called on the Government to ensure that trials are 
conducted in accordance with international fair trial standards, as laid down in the UDHR and 
ICCPR. The Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern regarding the above mentioned issues 
and referred to Articles 7, 25, 27(2), and 31 of the Afghan Constitution. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Reply from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>366. On 11 April 2008, the Government of the United States of America responded to a joint 
communication sent on 18 December 2006 by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture, (see A/HRC/4/26/Add.1, para. 69), regarding the situation of 
Bensayah Belkacem, Hadj Boudellaa, Saber Lahmar, Mustafa Ait idir, Boumediene Lakhdar, 
and Mohamed Nechle, six Algerian nationals who are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay. 
The United States detained these individuals under the laws of war as enemy combatants in the 
ongoing armed conflict with al Qaida and the Taliban. Like all Guantanamo detainees, these 
individuals received a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT). The Tribunal determined that 
these Algerian nationals are enemy combatants and the detainees are entitled to challenge that 
determination in the U.S. federal courts. Each enemy combatant also receives an annual review 
to determine whether the United States needs to continue detention in order to manage the threat 
they pose. An Administrative Review Board (ARB) conducts this review, and to date, ARB&#8217;s 
have determined all six detainees should remain in U.S. custody. In the annex to its 2005 report 
to the Committee Against Torture, the United States explained in extensive detail the process 
whereby individuals at Guantanamo Bay are captured, held, and released, as well as a description 
of conditions and treatment at the detention facility. The report reaffirms that U.S. officials from 
all government agencies are prohibited from engaging in torture, at all times, and in all places. 
All U.S. officials, wherever they may be, are also prohibited from engaging in cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment against any person in U.S. custody, as defined by our 
obligations under the Convention Against Torture. The above-referenced materials are available 
at http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/45738.

<p>released.&#8221; It also opened the door for serious human rights violations. In addition to being illegal, 
detention there was ineffective in criminal procedure terms. Similar severe abuses also occur at 
places of secret detention. Thus, with the same emphasis, the experts urge that all secret 
detention places be closed and that persons detained therein be given due process. The experts 
further emphasize that &#8220;moving forward with closing Guantanamo is a strong symbol that will 
help to repair the image of the country after damage by what was widely perceived as attempts at 
legitimizing the practice of torture under certain circumstances. At the same time they urge that 
in closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center and secret facilities, the U.S. government fully 
respect its international human rights obligations, notably the principle of non-refoulement that 
prohibits removing persons to countries where they would be at risk of torture, and not to 
transfer individuals to third countries for continued detention at its behest (proxy detention). The 
experts also stressed that those detainees facing criminal charges must be provided fair trials 
before courts that afford all essential judicial guarantees. They emphatically reject any proposals 
that Guantanamo detainees could through new legislation be subjected to administrative 
detention, as this would only prolong their arbitrary detention. In this context, the experts call on 
third countries to facilitate the closure through their full cooperation in resettling those 
Guantanamo detainees that cannot be sent back to their countries of origin. The UN experts 
particularly welcome the recent announcement of Portugal to accept detainees and support its 
call to other States to follow. The experts strongly support the commitment expressed by 
President-elect Obama which, in addition to restoring the moral stature of the United States in 
the world, will allow a dark chapter in the country&#8217;s history to be closed and to advance in the 
protection of human rights.

<p><b>D.  Observations
