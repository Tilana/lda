<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/199, in 
which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to prepare for the Human Rights 
Council a report on the implementation of that resolution based on the views collected in 
accordance with the request of the Commission on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>2. In paragraph 22 of resolution 65/199, the General Assembly recalled the request of the 
Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/5, that the Special Rapporteur 
continue to reflect on the issue of the inadmissibility of certain practices that contribute to 
fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and racial 
intolerance, to make relevant recommendations in his future reports and to seek and take 
into account in this regard the views of Governments and non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>3.  In the light of the information received, in the present report, the Special Rapporteur 
on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance addresses the latest developments that he has identified with regard to the 
human rights and democratic challenges that extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, as well as similar extremist ideological 
movements continue to pose. In this respect, he identifies good practices developed by 
States and different stakeholders since the previous report submitted by the Special 
Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/15/45) and the General Assembly 
(A/65/323) on the implementation of Assembly resolutions 63/162 and 64/147. In the 
report, he also examines the main areas of concern where more efforts and consistent 
vigilance are required, including with regard to the protection of vulnerable groups of 
individuals against racist and xenophobic crimes and the protection and consolidation of 
democracy and human rights in general.  
</p>
<p>4.  The Special Rapporteur points out that the current report is based on information 
received up to 4 July 2011. Furthermore, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 
65/199, paragraph 23, a more detailed report including a summary of the contributions sent 
by States and other stakeholders on the implementation of the above mentioned resolution, 
will be submitted to the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session.  
</p>
<p>5.  The Special Rapporteur concludes the report with his conclusions and 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Good practices developed at the national level to counter 
extremist political parties, movements and groups, including 
neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist 
ideological movements 
</b></p>
<p>6.  In the section below, the Special Rapporteur presents an overview of some of the 
practices developed by States and other stakeholders to counter extremist political parties, 
movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist 
ideological movements. The information provided to the Special Rapporteur shows that 
legislative, policy and institutional measures have been taken by States. Such 
governmental measures have also been complemented by encouraging initiatives 
developed by civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>7.  In his previous report submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/15/45), the 
Special Rapporteur noted that the persistent existence of extremist political parties, 
movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist 
ideological movements poses major challenges to a number of human rights and freedoms, </p>


<p>including the human rights principle of non-discrimination. Indeed, extremist political 
parties, movements and groups bring into question this fundamental principle by 
propagating an ideology based on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. Non-discrimination, together with equality before the law and equal protection 
of the law without any discrimination, constitute a basic principle in the protection of 
human rights. As stated in article 2 of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, States have the obligation to prohibit racial 
discrimination by any persons, group or organization and not to sponsor, defend or support 
racial discrimination by any persons or organizations.  
</p>
<p>8.   A number of States have indicated that their Constitution and legislation prohibit 
racial discrimination. The Special Rapporteur welcomes such a step. The Special 
Rapporteur also notes with interest the information provided by States about non-citizens 
being guaranteed equality before the law and human rights without discrimination. He also 
welcomes the legislative measures taken to combat racism in sport. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that domestic law does not always fully cover the definition of racial 
discrimination as enshrined in article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur urges States 
parties to this important instrument to ensure that the definition of racial discrimination 
under their domestic order complies with the provisions of article 1 and prohibit and 
eliminate any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, 
descent or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing 
the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of 
public life. The Special Rapporteur also recalls that, under article 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, &#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited 
by law&#8221;. Furthermore, paragraph 13 of the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference reaffirms that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence should be prohibited by law, 
as should be the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to 
racial discrimination as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts. 
</p>
<p>9.  In their contributions, some countries admitted that, while a national law prohibiting 
racial discrimination had been adopted, it was not yet into force. The slow process of entry 
into force of legislation for diverse reasons, including those related to each national 
context at a certain time, may be an important barrier in addressing the major challenges 
that extremist political parties, movements and groups represents for human rights and 
democracy. Indeed, without any operational legal framework the rights of victims of racist 
or xenophobic crimes by extremist political parties, movements and groups can be 
hampered and the impunity of the perpetrators fostered. Therefore, it is crucial that 
appropriate measures be taken to ensure that the legal acts needed for the entry into force 
of relevant anti-discrimination legislation are adopted and the legislation is fully 
implemented. Governments must also ensure that the legislation adopted criminalizes 
racist acts perpetrated by extremist political parties, movements and groups. In this regard, 
the Special Rapporteur appreciates the fact that, in some countries, racial discrimination 
and incitement to racial hatred are declared an offence under the criminal code. He also 
welcomes information indicating that racist or xenophobic motive are aggravating factors 
in relation to some offences under criminal law. The Special Rapporteur recalls that States 
must ensure that the provisions adopted conform fully with their obligations under article 4 
of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>10.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the adoption of national 
action plans and policies to combat racism and racial discrimination and to promote the 
social integration of individuals belonging to minorities. He appreciates in particular the 
number of programmes specifically launched by some States to combat extremism. In this 
regard, measures regarding the legal aid provided to victims or programmes to steer youth </p>


<p>away from right-wing extremist groups by offering vocational training and relocation 
opportunities are welcomed.  
</p>
<p>11.  The Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight some of the institutional 
developments reported. These include the establishment of national human rights 
institutions or specialized institutions to monitor and raise awareness about racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It was indicated that such institutions 
are sometimes also empowered to receive complaints and to investigate into cases of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The Special Rapporteur 
is of the view that this is a positive step and that it is essential that such specialized 
institutions, which could also monitor and raise awareness about the challenges posed by 
extremist political parties, movements and groups and advise on measures to counter them, 
be established. States should ensure that such institutions have a robust mandate and 
adequate resources. 
</p>
<p>12.  A number of good practices were also identified with respect to awareness-raising 
activities to foster tolerance and respect for cultural diversity. According to the information 
provided, some countries have developed awareness-raising measures to combat racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to strengthen intercultural 
dialogue. These measures include the organization of cultural events, art festivals of 
national minorities, exhibitions, concerts, forums and seminars, and the publication of 
books and brochures promoting cultural diversity. Such initiatives, which offer space for 
further intercultural dialogue and interaction, are welcomed by the Special Rapporteur. 
Initiatives including information campaigns broadcast on television and the Internet aimed 
at promoting harmony and tolerance among different ethnic groups are also noted with 
interest by the Special Rapporteur. In this context, the Special Rapporteur also notes with 
interest media programmes that promote diversity and tolerance. Indeed, according to the 
information provided, the mainstream media in some countries have started to recognize 
the cultural asset of minorities and to promote the idea of improving the living and 
working conditions of members of minorities.  
</p>
<p>13.  Other positive examples identified include the training of law enforcement agents. 
The Special Rapporteur notes in particular that, in some cases, compulsory human rights 
training sessions were developed for the judiciary and that specific units to deal with hate 
crimes and racism were also established, including, for instance, in the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office. The Special Rapporteur also notes with interest that some countries have developed 
data-collection systems on hate crimes, including hate crimes committed against 
individuals on the grounds of race, colour, ethnicity, origin or minority status, citizenship, 
language, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender or transgender. It was also 
reported that some States specifically collect data on racist crimes committed by members 
of extremist groups.  
</p>
<p>14.  Educational measures also appear to be among the positive steps taken by States in 
response to the rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-
Nazis and skinhead groups, as well as similar extremist ideological movements. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that human rights education is of particular 
importance for a number of States. Addressing the root causes of extremist political 
parties, movements and groups is crucial and education is a key means to address such a 
challenging phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>15.  Cooperation with relevant international and regional human rights mechanisms and 
with civil society is also important. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
engagement of States with regional and international human rights mechanisms, including 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the special procedures and the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages States to continue to play an active role in countering extremist 
political parties, movements and groups through further cooperation with relevant regional 
and international human rights mechanisms.  </p>


<p>16.   Regarding initiatives developed by civil society organizations, the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes initiatives such as free legal aid for victims of hate crime, 
educational activities aimed at unmasking extremist ideologies in secondary schools, 
monitoring racially motivated crimes in football stadiums and the creation of national 
associations of intercultural media. Furthermore, in the absence of official data, the Special 
Rapporteur has noted that non-governmental organizations have played a key role in 
fulfilling the gap sometimes left by the State in this area by collecting, inter alia, data on 
hate crimes. It was stated that these initiatives have provided an estimate of the prevalence 
of such crimes and the possibility of assessing the impact of legislation in the area of racist 
crimes.  
</p>
<p>17.   While good practices have been developed, challenges remain that require further 
efforts from States to counter extremist political parties, movements and groups, including 
neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological movements. These 
challenges lie in particular in the protection of vulnerable groups of individuals against 
racist and xenophobic crimes and the protection and consolidation of democracy and 
human rights in general. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Remaining challenges relating to the existence of extremist 
political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis 
and skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological 
movements 
</b></p>
<p>18.  In the section below, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the two main challenges that 
emerged from the information he received from different stakeholders. These challenges 
concern (a) the protection of vulnerable groups of individuals against racist and 
xenophobic crimes, and (b) the protection and consolidation of democracy and human 
rights, challenges that were identified by the Special Rapporteur in his previous report to 
the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/15/45). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Protecting vulnerable groups of individuals against racist and 
xenophobic crimes 
</b></p>
<p>19.  An important feature of extremist political parties, movements and groups already 
highlighted by the Special Rapporteur in his previous report is their ability to blame 
specific groups of individuals for the insecurity and socio-economic problems experienced 
by the population and to incite discrimination against persons belonging to these 
vulnerable groups. One particular concern is that their ideologies may also go beyond 
racist, xenophobic and intolerant rhetoric and explicitly incite or justify the perpetration of 
acts of violence against certain groups of individuals. Their action may also sometimes 
inflame social tensions, complicate inter-ethnic relations and induce fear in the targeted 
groups. The information received seemed to show that vulnerable groups of individuals, 
such as members of minorities, Roma and Sinti, migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, 
continue to be the main victims of violence and attacks perpetrated or incited by extremist 
political parties, movements and groups, who also often regard themselves as the only 
legitimate holders and guardians of the national identity of a given country.  
</p>
<p>20.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned to see that the 
preoccupation he raised in his latest annual report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/17/40) about attacks against Roma by extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, sometimes in total impunity, remain valid and accurate. Indeed, in that report, the 
Special Rapporteur warned about the rise of extremism, which increases Roma 
vulnerability to racist violence, and expressed his concern at the reported cases of assault </p>


<p>against Roma by groups of skinheads, and about racist slogans against Roma, written on 
walls by a neo-Nazi group (named Nazi Swastika). Unfortunately, the most recent reports 
received by the Special Rapporteur contain similar information.  
</p>
<p>21.  For instance, it was reported that, in some countries, extremist political parties have 
been at the forefront of political action against Roma camps. In a number of cases, it was 
also reported that Roma were often negatively portrayed and stigmatized especially, but 
not exclusively, by extremist nationalist groups. According to the information received, 
some incidents involving members of the Roma community occurred in recent years. For 
instance, cases of attacks by skinheads against groups of Roma people leading to injuries 
were reported. Similarly, some stakeholders reported that the police found the leaflets of a 
far-right group at the homes of some of the suspects in a case where a youth threw 
Molotov cocktails into a house inhabited by Roma. 
</p>
<p>22.  The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the establishment and development 
of &#8220;vigilante&#8221; groups or &#8220;self-defence guards&#8221; with extremist ideologies, including 
sometimes neo-Nazi ideology, who have attacked individuals, including Roma, sometimes 
without being prosecuted or sentenced. Reports were received about an increase in the 
creation and development of paramilitary groups, marching in some cases in the black 
uniform of the pre-Second World War fascist past, in underdeveloped settlements 
inhabited by Roma, on the pretence of preventing crime. In some cases, it was reported 
that the police did not prevent such demonstrations. The information received indicates 
that these groups share certain characteristics, such as militant posturing in uniforms, with 
anti-Roma and authoritarian ideology, and promising public security and offering effective 
protection for citizens in response to the failure of law enforcement agents, including the 
police, to do so. Some are also openly anti-Semite. It was also reported that, in some cases, 
these organizations were supported and sponsored by extremist political parties, which 
gain political benefit from the media coverage of events involving vigilante groups. 
Furthermore, their presence in small communities helps the party behind them to maintain 
regular contact with the local population and therefore to increase their influence, 
including in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>23.  The Special Rapporteur also received reports about incidents against migrants and 
foreigners committed by individuals closely linked to far-right nationalist parties, 
including attacks on houses where immigrants live, arson attacks on houses and places of 
worship, cases of beatings and stabbings of migrants and asylum-seekers in the street, and 
racist demonstrations in areas frequented by undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers 
that have led to them being injured. It was also reported that, in some cases, vigilante 
groups comprising members of extremist political parties, together with local residents, 
have been patrolling certain areas and intimidating, threatening and attacking migrants, 
thus creating &#8220;migrant-free zones&#8221;. Racist demonstrations organized by &#8220;extreme right 
elements&#8221; leaving migrants injured were also reported.  
</p>
<p>24.  The Special Rapporteur urges States to take the measures necessary to ensure that 
perpetrators of racially motivated acts are held responsible and brought to justice. States 
should also pay due attention to the victims of such crimes, especially those belonging to 
vulnerable groups, by providing them with effective means to make complaints and to 
have access to effective remedies. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
the underreporting of racist crimes by victims continues to be a problem, including in the 
case of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers. This lack of reporting distorts statistics and 
data, and may as a result create the impression that racist crimes by extremist political 
parties, movements and groups do not exist or are less prevalent than they actually are. The 
information received indicates that victims do not report incidents for several reasons, 
including fear of the police, a lack of trust in the criminal justice system and in public 
institutions in general, fear of reprisals, and sometimes language barriers and ignorance of 
the victims of their rights. States should ensure that victims are made aware of their rights 
and therefore have access to justice, including reparation. Further measures to better </p>


<p>engage with the victims, reduce fears, instil a sense of trust between the police and victims, 
and encourage the reporting of such crimes must be taken. Law enforcement officers and 
members of the judiciary should also be provided with specific training to help them deal 
with racist and xenophobic crimes in an effective, appropriate and human rights-based 
manner. 
</p>
<p>25.  The lack of ethnically disaggregated data also remains an obstacle in addressing 
racist crimes committed or incited by extremist political parties, movements and groups. It 
was reported, for instance, that racially motivated crimes are often under-recorded and that 
major problems therefore arise when figures or even estimates of hate crimes committed 
have to be provided. The quality, reliability and pertinence of statistical tools used in some 
countries were also questioned. The collection of accurate and up-to-date ethnically 
disaggregated data on racist and xenophobic crimes is important, since it may help inform 
policy decisions on combating such crimes. The Special Rapporteur encourages those 
States that have not yet developed a system to collect ethnically disaggregated data to do 
so.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Protecting and consolidating democracy and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>26.  As stated by the General Assembly in its resolution 65/199, extremist political 
parties, movements and groups pose a real threat to democratic values. In 2001, at the 
Durban Conference, States also recognized that political platforms and organizations based 
on racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination are 
incompatible with democracy. Unfortunately, reports received show that extremist political 
parties, movements and groups have gained influence in a number of countries and 
regions. Indeed, according to the information received, in recent years, the number of seats 
occupied by representatives of extremist political parties has continued to increase in 
national parliaments. Similar trends of particular concern were also reported at the regional 
level, where a number of far-right political parties managed to obtain seats during 
parliamentary elections. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received reports indicating 
that rhetoric by extremist political parties blaming migrants for political, economic and 
social problems has gained more supporters in the current economic crisis. Information 
received also suggests an increase in some cases of the popularity of extremist political 
parties engaging in election campaigns, and blaming in this context minorities, migrants 
and asylum-seekers for the problems of the country. Furthermore, it was reported that 
some extremist political parties, movements and groups have adopted new strategies to 
secure a place on the political scene by refraining from openly propagating racist and 
xenophobic discourse. Their strategy consists notably in adopting a more human rights-
based discourse in order to gain votes and avoid being the subject of legal complaints. This 
will requires a more vigilant approach if such strategies developed by extremist political 
parties, movements and groups are to be thwarted.  
</p>
<p>27.  While countering extremist political parties, movements and groups remains a core 
challenge, another important challenge is the sometimes equivocal position taken by 
mainstream political parties towards them. The Special Rapporteur is indeed concerned 
about information received indicating that traditional political parties continue in some 
countries to form coalitions with extremist political parties. In view of the upcoming 
presidential and legislative elections to be held in some countries, the Special Rapporteur 
calls upon traditional political parties to refrain from seeking coalitions with extremist 
political parties and to avoid using electoral contexts to fuel populist ideas. He warns 
traditional political parties about the danger of endorsing through such coalitions the racist 
and xenophobic policies and programmes put forward by extremist political parties, which 
often aim at discriminating specific groups of individuals. It is crucial that political parties 
base their programmes and activities on respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy 
and the rule of law, and condemn any political message aimed at fuelling racist, 
xenophobic, discriminatory or intolerant ideas.  </p>


<p>28.  It is imperative that political leaders avoid playing the game of populism to gain 
votes and take all the measures necessary to deal adequately with certain social and 
economic issues, such as immigration, unemployment and insecurity, in particular in the 
current period of economic crisis and sometimes the discontent with and mistrust of the 
population in traditional political parties. As emphasized by the Special Rapporteur in his 
previous report (A/HRC/15/45, para. 30), political leaders and parties should provide 
answers to the populist and oversimplified statements of extremist political parties, 
movements and groups through reasoned argument, especially on the issues posed by 
immigration, insecurity and unemployment.  
</p>
<p>29.  In the above context, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that any measures 
to counter extremist political parties, movements and groups have to be taken in 
accordance with international human rights law and in a manner that upholds democratic 
principles. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports indicating that, in some 
cases, the law on extremism has been used to deprive political opponents of democratic 
legitimacy by labelling them as extremist and to unduly limit freedom of expression, 
including of the media. He recalls that States must ensure that all individuals and groups of 
individuals enjoy fully their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association as 
enshrined in articles 19, 21 and 22 respectively of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. The Special Rapporteur further reiterates that, in any democratic society, 
individuals must be able to challenge the system in place and propose ideas for change. 
Indeed, the free expression of the will of the people must be respected. All individuals, 
regardless of their ideas, including those deemed radical, should be guaranteed without 
discrimination the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through 
chosen representatives, and to vote or to be elected at genuine elections.  
</p>
<p>30.  Some stakeholders also provided information about the increased use of the Internet 
by individuals and groups of individuals closely linked to extremist movements to 
disseminate racist ideas. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to express his 
concern about the use of the Internet to propagate racism, xenophobia, racial 
discrimination and related intolerance. In accordance with the provisions of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference, the Special Rapporteur encourages States to use the opportunities provided by 
new technologies, including the Internet, to counter the dissemination of ideas based on 
racial superiority or hatred. Furthermore, he reiterates that determining which acts or 
expressions may meet the thresholds determined in articles 19 to 22 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in article 4 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination, is ultimately a decision that is best made 
after a thorough assessment of the individual circumstances of each case. This decision 
should always be guided by well-defined criteria, in accordance with international 
standards, and be made by an independent and impartial court or tribunal, taking into 
account the local conditions, history, culture and political context. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b> The Special Rapporteur takes note of the efforts made by States to counter 
extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead 
groups, and similar extremist ideological movements. However, while good practices 
have been identified, important challenges remain that require greater efforts and 
increased vigilance from States. Indeed, extremist political parties, movements and 
groups continue to pose major challenges, especially with regard to the protection of 
vulnerable groups of individuals against racist and xenophobic crimes, and the 
protection and consolidation of democracy and human rights in general. It is crucial 
that a comprehensive approach based on a solid legal framework that also includes 
key complementary measures be developed and that it be implemented in an </b></p>


<p><b>effective, inclusive and cooperative manner with the involvement of relevant actors. 
Particular attention should be paid to victims, and the sharing of good practices 
should also be taken into consideration by States. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur makes the recommendations below.  
</b></p>
<p><b>32. As stated in the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, any 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence should be prohibited by law, as should the 
dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial 
discrimination as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts. In this regard, 
the Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to respect the commitments made in the 
Durban documents. He calls upon States parties to the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination to comply fully with their 
obligations as enshrined in article 4. 
</b></p>
<p><b>33. In order to prevent and to address in an effective manner the perpetration of 
racist or xenophobic crimes by individuals and groups of individuals closely linked to 
extremist political parties, movements and groups, States are urged to introduce into 
their domestic criminal law a provision according to which committing an offence 
with racist or xenophobic motivation or aim constitutes an aggravating circumstance 
allowing for heavier sanctions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>34. In this regard, States have the responsibility of bringing to justice the 
perpetrators of crimes with racist or xenophobic motivation and to fight against 
impunity. Indeed, as stated in paragraph 81 of the Durban Declaration, any form of 
impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in 
weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of 
such acts. Therefore States should ensure prompt, thorough and impartial 
investigation of racist and xenophobic crimes, and ensure that those responsible are 
adequately sanctioned.  
</b></p>
<p><b>35. Due attention should also be paid to the victims of such crimes, whose rights to 
life and security of person are violated. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur urges 
States to ensure the full access of victims of crimes motivated by racist or xenophobic 
attitudes to effective legal remedies, including the right to seek just and adequate 
reparation for any damage suffered as a result of such crimes. The Special 
Rapporteur also recommends that States ensure that victims of racist or xenophobic 
crimes are provided with necessary legal, medical and psychological assistance. States 
should also ensure that all victims are made aware of their rights and of existent 
judicial and non-judicial remedies. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that States 
should further engage with vulnerable groups who are at particular risk of racist or 
xenophobic crimes, reduce their fear, restore confidence in law enforcement officers 
and allow for better reporting of such crimes.  
</b></p>
<p><b>36. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the increased use of the Internet by 
extremist political parties, movements and groups to proliferate, promote and 
disseminate racist content. He would like to reaffirm the positive role that freedom of 
expression can play in promoting democracy and combating racist and xenophobic 
ideologies. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur calls on States to implement fully 
articles 19 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association and 
determine the limitations thereto. He also encourages States to use new technologies, 
including the Internet, to promote the values of equality, non-discrimination, diversity 
and democracy.  
</b></p>
<p><b>37. The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that law enforcement agents 
collect data on racist and xenophobic crimes and that they improve the quality of such 
data-collection systems. As the Special Rapporteur stated in his previous report </b></p>


<p><b>(A/HRC/15/45, para. 29), data on racist and xenophobic crimes help States to develop 
effective policies and programmes to tackle crimes motivated by racist or xenophobic 
attitudes, to assess and monitor the effectiveness of measures taken, and to review 
existing legislation when necessary. The collection of such data can also help States to 
identify the types of offences committed and the characteristics of victims and 
perpetrators, especially if they are affiliated with an extremist political party, 
movement or group.  
</b></p>
<p><b>38. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that States strengthen the capacity of 
law enforcement agents and members of the judiciary through adequate and 
mandatory human rights training, with a focus on crimes motivated by racist or 
xenophobic attitudes. Law enforcement agents should be provided with the necessary 
instructions, procedures and resources to identify, investigate and register racist and 
xenophobic crimes.  
</b></p>
<p><b>39. Concrete steps should be taken to raise awareness among the population about 
the adverse effects of the ideologies and activities of extremist political parties, 
movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar 
extremist ideological movements. The organization of cultural events, festivals, 
conferences, seminars, competitions, exhibitions, research work and publications, as 
well as information campaigns and other events aimed at providing a space for 
intercultural dialogue and interaction, are further positive measures which contribute 
to the building of a society based on pluralism, tolerance, respect for cultural 
diversity, multiculturalism and non-discrimination. The Special Rapporteur 
emphasize that human rights education is a key tool in countering the rise of extremist 
political parties, movements and groups. Educational measures are indeed crucial in 
promoting human rights and democratic values at an early age.  
</b></p>
<p><b>40. Preserving and consolidating democracy is essential to effectively prevent and 
combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. In this 
regard, political leaders and political parties must strongly condemn all political 
messages that disseminate ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to 
racial discrimination or xenophobia. Political leaders and political parties should be 
aware of the moral authority that they bear, and promote tolerance and respect, and 
refrain from forming coalitions with extremist political parties of a racist or 
xenophobic character. Respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy and the 
rule of law must always be the cornerstone of any programme or activity developed by 
political parties, while they bear in mind the need to ensure that the political and legal 
systems reflect the multicultural character of their societies at all levels.  
</b></p>
<p><b>41. Efforts made by States to counter extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological 
movements should be enhanced through the replication of good practices. In this 
regard, it is important that the sharing of good practices among all relevant 
stakeholders be increased. Indeed, as stated in the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference, a broad sharing of best practices in all regions of the world aimed 
at preventing, combating and eradicating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance can assist Governments, Parliaments, the judiciary, social 
partners and civil society in the effective implementation of the provisions of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</b></p>
<p><b>42. To conclude, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall the importance of 
cooperating closely with civil society and international and regional human rights 
mechanisms to effectively counter extremist political parties, movements and groups, 
including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological 
movements. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes in particular the important role 
played by civil society in collecting information, working closely with victims and 
promoting democratic principles and human rights. The Special Rapporteur also calls </b></p>


<p><b>upon national human rights institutions to develop appropriate programmes to 
promote tolerance of and respect for all persons and all human rights, and to combat 
extremism.
