<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
</p>
<p>Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the United Nations Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to promote 
</p>
<p>social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, and to employ international 
</p>
<p>machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> General Assembly resolution 68/304 entitled &#8220;Towards the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>adopted on 9 September 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Human Rights Council on the effects of structural adjustment and economic 
</p>
<p>reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, the most recent being Council resolution 25/16 of 15 
</p>
<p>April 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work and commending the contributions of the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States 
</p>
<p>on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>in particular the conclusions and recommendations of his report with a thematic focus on 
</p>

<p>vulture funds,1 in which he aimed to draw global attention to the negative impact of the 
</p>
<p>activities of vulture funds on international debt relief efforts and on the capacity of indebted 
</p>
<p>poor countries that have benefited from debt relief to create the necessary conditions for the 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, including the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the concern expressed in the declaration that Heads of State and Government 
</p>
<p>of the Group of 77 and China issued on the occasion of the summit entitled &#8220;For a New 
</p>
<p>World Order for Living Well&#8221;, held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of 
</p>
<p>Bolivia, on 14 and 15 June 2014,2 that reiterates the importance of not allowing vulture 
</p>
<p>funds to paralyse the debt restructuring efforts of developing countries, and that these funds 
</p>
<p>should not supersede the State&#8217;s right to protect its people under international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the sovereign right of any State to restructure its sovereign debt, which 
</p>
<p>should not be frustrated or impeded by any measure emanating from another State, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that debt burden contributes to extreme poverty and hunger and is an 
</p>
<p>obstacle to sustainable human development, to the realization of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals and to the right to development, and is thus a serious impediment to the 
</p>
<p>realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> all Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes and the private sector, when designing policies and programmes, to take into 
</p>
<p>consideration the guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights,3 in particular 
</p>
<p>paragraphs 6, 8 and 20 thereof, that were endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 20/10 of 10 July 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the international financial system does not have a sound legal framework 
</p>
<p>for the orderly and predictable restructuring of sovereign debt, which further increases the 
</p>
<p>economic and social cost of non-compliance, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern</i> about the voluntary nature of international debt relief 
</p>
<p>schemes, which has created opportunities for vulture funds to acquire defaulted sovereign 
</p>
<p>debt at vastly reduced prices and then seek repayment of the full value of the debt through 
</p>
<p>litigation, seizure of assets or political pressure, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking into account</i> the fact that vulture funds, through litigation and other means, 
</p>
<p>oblige indebted countries to divert financial resources saved from debt cancellation and 
</p>
<p>diminish the impact of, or dilute the potential gains from, debt relief for these countries, 
</p>
<p>thereby undermining the capacity of Governments to guarantee the full enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights of the population, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the research proposal on the activities of vulture funds and human rights 
</p>
<p>proposed by the Advisory Committee in its action 13/7 at its thirteenth session4 and 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Human Rights Council for its consideration, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Condemns</i> the activities of vulture funds for the direct negative effect that the 
</p>
<p>debt repayment to those funds, under predatory conditions, has on the capacity of 
</p>
<p>Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, particularly economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights and the right to development; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reaffirms</i> in this context that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of 
</p>
<p>the problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  A/HRC/14/21. 
</p>
<p> 2  See A/68/948, annex. 
</p>
<p> 3 A/HRC/20/23, annex. 
</p>
<p> 4  See A/HRC/AC/13/2. </p>


<p>current system, which directly affects the enjoyment of human rights in debtor States, and 
</p>
<p>calls upon States to consider implementing legal frameworks to curtail predatory vulture 
</p>
<p>fund activities within their jurisdictions; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Encourages</i> all States to participate in the negotiations aimed at establishing 
</p>
<p>a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes, as referred to in 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 68/304, and invites States participating in the negotiations to 
</p>
<p>ensure that such a multilateral legal framework will be compatible with existing 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations and standards; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Advisory Committee to prepare a research-based report on the 
</p>
<p>activities of vulture funds and the impact on human rights, and to present a progress report 
</p>
<p>of that research to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-first session for its consideration; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also requests</i> the Advisory Committee to seek the views and inputs of 
</p>
<p>Member States, United Nations agencies, relevant international and regional organizations, 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant 
</p>
<p>special procedures, including the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and 
</p>
<p>other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
</p>
<p>rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, as well as national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and non-governmental organizations, in the preparation of the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>research-based report.
