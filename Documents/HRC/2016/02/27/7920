<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire from 22 to 31 July 2012, at 
the invitation of the Government. Pursuant to the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s mandate, contained 
in Human Rights Council resolution 14/6, he sought to examine the situation of all 
internally displaced persons in the country, including those displaced due to the 2010 post-
election violence, or due to other reasons. While displacement has been triggered 
principally by civil strife, other factors, such as land issues, citizenship and national 
identity, and inter-community conflicts, have fuelled these crises.  
</p>
<p>Although there have been some notable advancements in re-establishing law and order 
in the country, the security situation remains fragile, and has been affected by slow progress in 
the areas of security sector reform and national reconciliation. Concerted efforts are also 
required to facilitate durable solutions for internally displaced persons. While most have 
returned, locally integrated or resettled elsewhere in the country, many continue to live in 
precarious situations, including in the west, and require assistance to meet both their immediate 
humanitarian and longer term durable solution needs. The consolidation of peace in C&#244;te 
d&#8223;Ivoire, and protection from forced displacement in the future, require continued efforts to 
address the root causes of conflict and promote an inclusive national reconciliation process.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate, contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
14/6, and at the invitation of the Government of C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the human rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official 
visit to C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire from 22 to 31 July 2012. The Special Rapporteur undertook this visit 
in order to examine the current situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the 
country. While the primary focus of the visit was the situation of persons internally 
displaced as a result of the 2010 post-election violence, other periods and causes of 
displacement were also examined. The Special Rapporteur&#8223;s conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations are based on his findings during his visit, and on the Guiding Principles 
on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, annex). 
</p>
<p>2. In the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the then Prime Minister, 
Head of Government and Minister of Justice, Jeannot Kouadio-Ahoussou; the Minister of 
Human Rights and Public Liberties, Gn&#233;n&#233;ma Coulibaly; the Minister of Ex-Combatants 
and War Victims, Mathieu Babaud Darret; the then Delegate Minister of Justice, Loma 
Matto Ciss&#233;; the Minister of the Interior, Hamed Bakayoko; the Minister of Agriculture, 
Mamadou Sangafowa Coulibaly; the Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of the Family, 
Women and the Child, Pierre Douhou; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Daniel Kablan 
Duncan; the Delegate Minister of Defence, Paul Koffi Koffi; and staff of the Ministry of 
Employment, Social Affairs and Solidarity. He also met with the president of the Dialogue, 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Charles Konan Banny; the Special Representative of 
the African Union, Ambroise Niyonsaba; civil society; United Nations organizations; and 
local officials in the field locations he visited.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited various sites of displacement, including the 
Nahibly IDP camp, which had been attacked and destroyed some days prior to his arrival; 
the grounds of the municipal building in which some IDPs from the camp were still seeking 
temporary refuge; areas of return and resettlement, particularly in the western part of the 
country (including Guiglo, Diahouin, Bedy Goazon, Diehiba and Du&#233;kou&#233;); and informal 
urban settlements in Abidjan, where he met with affected communities. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation to the Government of C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire for 
</p>
<p>its invitation, constructive engagement during the visit, and expressed willingness to 
continue this engagement. He is also grateful to the Office of the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General for C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA), which provided invaluable support during the preparations as well as 
throughout the visit. He also wishes to express appreciation for the cooperation and support 
provided by the United Nations Country Team, the members of the Protection Cluster and 
the internally displaced persons he met with who shared their concerns and experiences 
with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and socioeconomic context  
</b></p>
<p>4. Following independence in 1960, Felix Houphou&#235;t-Boigny served as President 
until his death in 1993. The first contested presidential election, which the incumbent 
President won by a majority, took place in 1990 after popular protests that resulted in the 
legalization of opposition parties. Popular protests took place once again in 1998, 
contesting a constitutional revision granting President Henri Konan B&#233;di&#233; enhanced </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>powers. President B&#233;di&#233; promoted the concept of <i>ivoirit&#233;</i>, which has been associated with 
xenophobic measures and reactions which drove out of the country a significant number of 
ethnic Malians and Burkinans in 1999. After President B&#233;di&#233; was overthrown in a military 
coup in December 1999, General Robert Gu&#233;&#239; assumed control of the country, resulting in 
the withdrawal of most of the foreign aid. A long period of political instability and violence 
was to follow, punctuated by an attempted coup in September 2002, and various 
unsuccessful peace accords.  
</p>
<p>5. In 2007, a peace deal signed with the rebels established a power-sharing 
Government and joint army. Presidential elections were held in October 2010, but the first 
round of voting between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara, who had 
been excluded from the 2000 presidential race due to the controversy regarding his Ivoirian 
nationality, was inconclusive. In the second round of voting, Mr. Ouattara defeated Mr. 
Gbagbo, but the latter refused to step down. After several months of fighting between pro-
Gbagbo forces and armed forces loyal to Mr. Ouattara, the latter managed to take control of 
much of the country by April 2011, and was sworn in the following month. 
</p>
<p>6. The 2010 post-election violence resulted in mass displacement, and although 
security largely improved by the end of 2011, violence has persisted in the form of inter-
community clashes, cross-border attacks and criminal activities, especially in the western 
part of the country bordering Liberia, and attacks in and around Abidjan.  
</p>
<p>7. While the country benefits from an abundance of natural resources, and is the 
world&#8223;s leading producer of cocoa beans, as of 2008, nearly 43 per cent of its population 
lived on the national poverty line, a figure which stood at only 10 per cent in 1985.1 This 
reveals a deteriorating situation, which is due in part to the negative consequences on the 
economy of the political instability of the last decade. C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire has a history of 
</p>
<p>significant immigration from neighbouring countries, is composed of diverse ethnic 
groups,2 and approximately 50 per cent of the population currently live in urban centres, 
mostly along the coastal regions.  
</p>
<p>8. In the National Development Plan (2012&#8211;2015), the Government states its 
ambition that C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire be an emerging economy by 2020, and its plans to improve the 
</p>
<p>country&#8223;s infrastructure and public services, with a focus on access to services for women, 
youth and children, and other vulnerable groups.3 The country&#8223;s geopolitical context is also 
a pivotal factor in its economic and security situation. It contributed to the country&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>traditional role as an important economic hub in the subregion, as well as to its 
multicultural and multi-ethnic composition. More recently, its proximity to Mali and the 
Sahel, which are experiencing a significant crisis, has been a source of concern.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights situation  
</b></p>
<p>9. C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire has ratified many of the major international and regional human 
rights instruments,4 and in 2009 was subject to the universal periodic review, which 
resulted in several recommendations relating to IDPs.5 
</p>
<p>10. A number of human rights reports, including United Nations reports and the report 
of the National Commission of Inquiry, have documented the human rights and

<p>international humanitarian law violations committed by various parties to the conflict 
during the 2010 post-election violence, in which over 3,000 persons were killed and many 
more subject to different human rights violations, including rapes, forced disappearances, 
torture and arbitrary detention.6 Since then, human rights violations by a variety of actors, 
including elements of the Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire (FRCI), Dozos (traditional 
hunters whose manner of dress and title have been taken up by armed groups and 
individuals) and non-state armed actors responsible for cross-border attacks, have persisted, 
often in the context of inter-community tensions and amid a climate of impunity &#8211; 
particularly in the west of the country.7 In view of the fragile security situation, through its 
resolution 2062 (2012), the Security Council extended the mandate of the United Nations 
Operation in C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire (UNOCI) until 31 July 2013, called on the Government to 
implement security sector reforms and condemned attacks against IDPs, including the 
attack against the Nahibly camp in Du&#233;kou&#233;.  
</p>
<p>11. In the west in particular, conflicts continue to be exacerbated by inter-community 
tensions and land disputes between local Gu&#233;r&#233; farmers and persons of Burkinan and 
Malian descent, and Ivoirians considered non-indigenous to the area. The attack of 20 July 
on the Nahibly camp &#8211; the last remaining IDP camp, in which more than 5,000 IDPs, 
mostly indigenous persons of Gu&#233;r&#233; ethnicity (who are perceived as pro-Gbagbo) were 
registered &#8211; was one of the most violent episodes of inter-community clashes in the 
country. The camp was attacked and burned to the ground by a mob of close to a thousand 
persons armed with machetes, bayonets and torches, from<i> allog&#232;ne </i>communities (see 
paragraph 15) of the Kokoma neighbourhood in Du&#233;kou&#233;, traditionally associated with the 
current party in power, namely the Rassemblement des R&#233;publicains. At least 8 persons 
were killed and 60 were injured. According to reports received by the Special Rapporteur, 
the attack took place despite the presence of the prefect of the region, FRCI officers and 
elements of an UNOCI contingent responsible for monitoring the external security of the 
camp.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur condemns this attack, which is a violation of the protection 
afforded IDPs according to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, international 
human rights and international humanitarian law. He notes that, according to information 
received by the Government, ongoing investigations have led to the issuance of arrest 
warrants against suspects of the attacks. However, he regrets that, to date, no findings have 
been announced in relation to investigations into the incident He urges the Government to 
pursue this as a matter of priority; to ensure that the investigations demystify the 
background to the attack; and to provide an analysis of why the attack was not prevented, 
despite the presence of government officials and UNOCI elements. With regard to the 
latter, there should be a special focus on lessons learned in relation to policing and 
protection practices within such camps, and the capacity and mandate of United Nations 
military contingents in such circumstances (namely, when providing the protection of an 
IDP camp from an attack by civilians).  
</p>
<p>13. In addition to the provisions on human rights in its national Constitution, and 
legislation permitting citizens to invoke these directly,8 C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire has a number of 
national institutions specifically addressing human rights. These include, inter alia, the

<p>Office of the Ombudsman, the National Human Rights Commission, the Ministry of 
Human Rights and Public Liberties, and the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission.9 Created in the aftermath of the post-election violence, the latter was 
established to promote dialogue, truth and reconciliation, and to investigate human rights 
abuses committed in the past and in recent times. 
</p>
<p><b> C. History, causes and extent of internal displacement  
</b></p>
<p>14. Forced displacement in the country&#8223;s recent history stems from a variety of causes, 
but most notably from the conflict and inter-community tensions that have persisted in the 
country over the past decade, and which are closely linked to issues of land and national 
identity.   
</p>
<p>15. The country&#8223;s long tradition of multiculturalism, internal migration and 
immigration, especially from neighbouring countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali 
(whose migrants often went to the south-west) began to suffer important tensions since the 
1990s, when the question of <i>ivoirit&#233;</i> became part of the political discourse. The economic 
crisis of the 1990s led many to return to rural areas from the cities to cultivate their family 
plots, to find that much of the land had been sold or was being used/rented by migrants. 
This fuelled the national divide around the notion of <i>ivoirit&#233;</i>, which restricted certain rights, 
such as the right to vote and own land, to nationals. It also gave rise to land disputes and 
tensions, particularly focused between ethnic groups who identify themselves or are 
identified by others as <i>autochtones</i> (ethnicities/communities perceived as local to C&#244;te 
d&#8223;Ivoire and to the region in question), <i>allochtones</i> (ethnicities or communities perceived as 
local to C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire but not to the region in question) and <i>allog&#232;nes</i> (ethnicities or 
communities perceived to be from outside C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire and therefore not Ivoirian). Both 
</p>
<p><i>allochtones</i> and <i>allog&#232;nes</i> have been commonly designated by <i>autochtones</i> as &#8220;foreigners&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. The significant waves of forced displacement in the country&#8223;s recent history date to 
the conflict that erupted in September 2002. This was followed by fighting which persisted 
over many years despite various peace agreements, and the more recent violence related to 
the 2010 post-election violence. In 2006, estimates in five departments alone placed the 
number of IDPs at over 700,000 persons.10 This number fluctuated over the next several 
years, but fresh displacement reached a peak in March 2011 after the post-election violence, 
which provoked the internal displacement of over 800,000 persons &#8211; a figure compounded 
by the significant number of IDPs displaced by the previous years of fighting who had not 
yet found a durable solution.  
</p>
<p>17. In the past, as in the most recent crisis, the vast majority of IDPs have been housed 
with host families and communities. Moreover, while during the more recent crisis many 
camps and informal shelters were established, government policy encouraged most IDPs to 
leave the camps within months of the crisis. Most returns occurred spontaneously, although 
some assistance was provided to enable people to leave the camps, including transportation, 
food and non-food items. By the time of the visit by this mandate, no IDP camps remained 
in the country, and internal displacement figures (from the post-election violence) had 
decreased to an estimated 81,000 persons.11 However, the Special Rapporteur found that 
this was not accompanied by solid durable solution strategies. 
</p>
<p>  
 9 Ibid., para. 99.  
 10 A/HRC/4/38/Add.2, para. 12. 
 11 OCHA, Bulletin Humanitaire, p. 1. Figures do not include people displaced between 2002 and 2007. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>18. Other causes of internal displacement in the country include inter-community 
conflicts, such as those in the agriculturally productive area in the west, which predate the 
crisis and have been closely tied to land-related conflicts in the past as well as at present. 
There have been reports of many people being chased from their homes by gangs of youth 
or by ethnic-based self-defence committees in the Moyen-Cavally region since 2003, and 
related conflicts in 2004 and 2005 in the regions of Guiglo, Blol&#233;quin and Du&#233;kou&#233;, which 
also led to displacement (A/HRC/4/38/Add.2, para. 11). 
</p>
<p>19. In this mandate&#8223;s previous visit to C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire in 2006, internal displacement 
relating to the destruction of some poor districts in Abidjan some years previous, which had 
left as many as 20,000 people on the street, was also noted (ibid., para. 10). While precise 
figures are not available, the Special Rapporteur received information during his visit that 
residents of some informal settlements in and around Abidjan continue to be at risk of 
eviction, due, among other reasons, to the fact that these areas are deemed prone to natural 
hazards.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Frameworks for the assistance and protection of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic response 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal, policy and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. At the time of writing, C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire had signed the African Union Convention for 
the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala 
Convention), and its ratification was pending the vote on a proposed bill authorizing it 
(anticipated to take place in the course of 2013). C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire does not have a 
comprehensive national law, policy or institutional framework specifically addressing the 
situation of IDPs in the country. A number of national policies and the activities of various 
government institutions have nonetheless included certain responsibilities and elements 
relating to IDPs.  
</p>
<p>21. At the time of the visit, as well as during the post-election violence, the Ministry of 
Employment, Social Affairs and Solidarity was the government focal point for issues 
relating to IDPs, as well as the chair of the National Committee for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Action, a platform established to ensure collaboration between the 
Government and national and international humanitarian organizations and more efficient 
policies in this area. Within this framework, a strategic plan was developed to facilitate the 
return of IDPs who were still in sites by the end of 2011 and who had opted for return.  
</p>
<p>22. Given the importance of certain issues, such as land and natural disasters to 
potential displacement, the role of other ministries is also engaged. An interministerial 
technical committee was established in June 2012 to address the land issue, following a 
national conference on land chaired by the Prime Minister. Some believe, however, that it 
would be important to have a specific government focal point on land reform issues, in 
order to ensure coordination of national efforts, and the participation of IDPs in the process. 
The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for emergency assistance in cases of natural 
disasters, an issue benefiting from provisions in the National Development Plan (2012&#8211;
2015) (paras. 477&#8211;479) providing for the establishment of early warning and natural 
disaster management systems.  
</p>
<p>23. While its mandate is broader, the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 
which is responsible for investigating abuses and addressing issues of compensation, 
restitution and the root causes of conflict, is nonetheless inclusive of IDPs. As of July 2012, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>the Commission had held two meetings with IDPs, and was intending to hold more 
hearings in the future. A member of the Commission also participated in a community 
meeting on 25 July 2012 &#8211; at which the Special Rapporteur was also present &#8211; between the 
Prefect of Du&#233;kou&#233; and community leaders in the aftermath of the attack on the Nahibly 
IDP camp, which had taken place just a few days before. The Commission has been 
affected by a lack of resources and criticised for its lack of results to date. More recently, 
the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Commission has decided to undertake 
a process of national consultations involving broad-based participation at both the central 
and local levels.  
</p>
<p>24. Policies to address the situations of internal displacement resulting from many 
years of conflict have included most notably a national strategy to facilitate the return of 
IDPs in the 2007 Ouagadougou Peace Agreement. The latter remained silent on the right of 
IDPs to locally integrate or resettle in a different part of the country however, and its 
relevant provisions, which were superseded by subsequent crisis, were never properly 
implemented.12 Moreover, by 2010 the emphasis had shifted from humanitarian activities to 
recovery and development projects, despite the lack of any improvement in social 
development indicators.13 Other measures to address the situation of IDPs at the time also 
failed to reach fruition. A bill defining mechanisms to compensate war victims, including 
IDPs, that had been drafted years ago had still not been enacted by the time the next IDP 
crisis occurred as a result of the 2010 post-election violence.14  
</p>
<p><b> B. International response 
</b></p>
<p>25. In response to the September 2002 armed rebellion, which resulted in grave 
violations and internal displacement, the Security Council passed resolution 1528 (2004) 
establishing UNOCI as of April 2004 (replacing the United Nations Mission in C&#244;te 
d&#8223;Ivoire). UNOCI has remained on the ground, including through the 2010 post-election 
violence. IDPs have repeatedly featured in the UNOCI mandate and Security Council 
resolutions, either specifically or in the context of the protection of civilians, with calls for 
their protection, assistance and durable solutions.15 
</p>
<p>26. The international humanitarian community, including organizations such as the 
International Committee of the Red Cross, UNHCR and various international non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), have in the past provided and continue to provide 
assistance towards durable solutions for IDPs and to conduct protection monitoring 
activities. However, given the persistent waves of displacement over the last decade this 
assistance has been generally insufficient. Even before the post-election violence, many 
IDPs remained displaced from previous conflicts; as of June 2010 there were still over half a 
million IDPs in the country.16 Yet, that year the international community was already 
prioritizing development and shifting from humanitarian to recovery activities.17 
</p>
<p>27. With the 2010 post-election violence and mass displacement, however, the 
humanitarian coordination structures, including the clusters (i.e., groupings of United 
Nations agencies, NGOs and international organizations concentrating on a specific sector

again at the national and regional levels, especially in the west of the country.  
</p>
<p>28. With the support of the international community, assistance was provided in the 
IDP sites during the displacement, as was transportation, non-food items and food assistance 
to enable returns, particularly from mid-2011 to 2012, after which assistance was mostly 
offered, based on need, in villages of return. Since 2012, more substantive assistance 
towards durable solutions, such as in the area of housing, income-generating activities, 
agricultural support and negotiation of land conflicts, has also been offered based on 
vulnerability, to some return areas. At the time of this visit, the cluster system was still 
active and providing key services to IDPs and affected communities. However, by the time 
of writing of the present report, the majority of the clusters had been formally closed, with 
the exception of the Protection Cluster, which continued to have a transition role and to 
support the Government in a number of areas. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Protection of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection from forced displacement: addressing systemic challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>and root causes 
</b></p>
<p>29. The need for improvements in the security situation and efforts towards national 
reconciliation in the country continue to be essential for the prevention of future forced 
displacement. In the course of 10 years of conflict and political turmoil, few government 
measures were taken to protect populations from forced displacement due to political 
violence, ethnic tensions or other causes. On the contrary, notions of national identity were 
instrumentalized, creating exclusion, widening the political divide and fuelling inter-
community clashes. Other related or root causes of violence and displacement, most 
notably the land issue, also failed to be successfully resolved. The various peace 
agreements over the years to end the conflict, and the attempts to quickly transition from 
humanitarian efforts to development (e.g. early 2010), without sufficient attention to 
reconciliation and sustainable solutions, were equally unsuccessful.  
</p>
<p>30. As a consequence, over the past decade many IDPs suffered multiple and 
secondary displacements, and many were never able to fully rebuild their lives. During the 
fighting which ensued as a result of the 2010 electoral crisis, renewed mass displacement 
took place amid a context of mass killings, gender-based violence, looting, enforced 
disappearances, hunger and xenophobic messages which fuelled latent inter-community 
conflicts.18 In order to provide effective protection from forced displacement in this context, 
the Special Rapporteur urges the Government of C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire to ratify the Kampala 
</p>
<p>Convention, and to develop implementing domestic legislation. The Kampala Convention, 
which places a strong emphasis on prevention (arts. 2&#8211;4, 9&#8211;10), can provide a solid 
framework within which to continue national efforts to address the root causes and other 
important systemic challenges, such as those relating to security, land, national identity 
documents, and mass evictions, which continue to pose a threat of forced displacement in 
the future.

</p>
<p><b> 1. The security situation and related reforms  
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur found that security remained a serious concern in parts of 
the country and continued to trigger new internal displacements, especially in the west. In 
June 2012, an estimated 20,000 people in the Tai-Para area on the Liberian border were 
displaced following a number of attacks between different armed groups and the national 
army. Other attacks and resulting internal displacements have also taken place more 
recently, and are further detailed in the &#8220;Durable solutions&#8221; section of the present report 
(section IV (B)). The Special Rapporteur believes that the adoption and efficient 
implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) strategies and 
security sector strategies are a matter of national priority and essential to re-establish 
confidence in the security and law enforcement sector, fight impunity and prevent future 
forced displacements.  
</p>
<p>32. As such, he was pleased to learn at the time of his visit that a government technical 
committee was in the process of finalizing a draft DDR strategy and a security sector 
reform strategy. In this regard, he wishes to emphasize that security sector reforms should 
be sufficiently comprehensive to include different groups and sources of insecurity, 
including non-State armed groups, such as the Dozos; illicit circulation of arms; banditry; 
and concerns relating to human rights abuses by the FRCI. In relation to the DDR process, 
he stresses the need for a vetting mechanism which makes the human rights record of a 
soldier a condition to serve in the new army. Moreover, both strategies should include 
relevant considerations relating to IDPs, and a process by which IDPs can participate in 
their development and follow-up.  
</p>
<p>33. At the same time, it is equally critical that the police and <i>gendarmerie</i> are provided 
the resources to resume their civilian policing and justice sector roles, which in many 
locations in the country, in particular in the west, continue to be carried out by the FRCI. 
Restoring confidence in the justice and rule of law sector, including through the restoration 
of civilian policing, together with security sector reform and reconciliation efforts, will be 
essential to combat the climate of mistrust and inter-community tensions, which risk 
provoking new forced displacements. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to take note of 
recent information provided by the Government indicating that security sector reform is in 
progress, that police services are being progressively deployed throughout the country and 
relating to the creation of a new authority for DDR called the &#8220;Autorit&#233; pour le 
D&#233;sarmement, la D&#233;mobilisation et la R&#233;integration&#8221;, on 8 August 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Land and national identity issues   
</b></p>
<p>34. During the visit, government officials, civil society and many of the IDPs the 
Special Rapporteur met with stressed the role of land in conflict and displacement, and 
underlined the importance of addressing these through the development and 
implementation of a sound land reform strategy. Human rights reports have documented the 
human rights violations related to land disputes, including violations of the rights to life, 
work, health and other rights of IDPs, including in the west of the country.19  
</p>
<p>35. A law relating to rural land, namely, the <i>Loi relative au domaine foncier rural 
</i>(hereafter, 1998 land law), was adopted in 1998, with subsequent modifications in August 
2004. The chief objective of this law is to identify, list and transform/convert customary 
rights relating to the use of land (i.e., droits sur l&#8217;usag<i>e du sol dits droits coutumiers</i>) into 
private property rights regulated by the State. The law also seeks to regularize the legal 
relationship between persons owning land titles/certificates, and persons working or using 
</p>
<p>  
 19 See, for example, UNOCI/HRD/2011/02, paragraphs 22&#8211;23.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the land but who are not landowners, through the signing of a contractual lease of the land. 
In addition, it provides for the delimitation of all village parameters, the establishment of a 
rural land registry (<i>cadastre rural</i>) and a related information management system.20 
Unfortunately, very limited implementation of the law has taken place to date due to the 
conflict and the lack of the considerable resources necessary to do so.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged that the Government of Alassane Ouattara 
has placed land issues on the national agenda, and took the initiative in June 2012 to 
convene an intergovernmental seminar on the topic. The Government has indicated that it 
intends to refer to the 1998 land law, albeit with some possible modifications, to address the 
land issue both generally, as well as in order to settle land disputes resulting from 
displacement. To date, no alternative system of restitution or compensation for the 
properties IDPs were forced to abandon or saw destroyed due to the conflict has been 
developed.  
</p>
<p>37. While the Special Rapporteur is pleased that land issues have been recognized as a 
priority issue, he believes that a number of considerations specific to IDPs must be taken 
into account, and he urges the Government, with the assistance of the international 
community, to integrate these into the land debate and law, and to facilitate the 
participation of IDP communities, including internally displaced women, in the process of 
land reform. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that relying exclusively on the 1998 land 
law, which involves a long-term national land-titling process requiring substantial 
resources, may not respond specifically enough or in a timely manner to the needs of 
displacement-affected communities, and that urgent land-related issues may in the 
meantime trigger further conflicts and renewed displacement.  
</p>
<p>38. Other potential areas of concern in the 1998 land law, from a displacement 
perspective, include administrative and procedural requirements which IDPs may have 
difficulty meeting, such as: the need for the claimant to approach his or her municipality of 
origin in order to submit a claim; the fact that public notifications of such claims are only to 
be made in the place of origin, rendering it difficult for IDPs who have not returned to 
know of abusive claims; and the requirement of peaceful and continuous occupation in 
order to gain recognition of customary land rights. Such requirements may be problematic 
for IDPs who, having had to abandon their land and property, may nonetheless be unable or 
unwilling to return to their place of origin, or for others who need a rapid mechanism to 
address issues of secondary occupation of their land and property.   
</p>
<p>39. Moreover, the fact that the 1998 land law limits ownership rights over rural land 
has raised the issue of the citizenship of foreign migrants who settled decades ago, as well 
as those born in C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire to foreign parents, who in some cases could have a claim to 
citizenship but do not have personal documentation or lack the necessary information to 
undertake the procedures to request citizenship. The Special Rapporteur found that tensions 
over land continue to be a prominent feature of the national political landscape, and 
believes that without a resolution of these fundamental issues relating to national identity, 
citizenship and land, they will continue to constitute a risk of new displacements and an 
impediment to national reconciliation.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Statelessness and personal identity documents  
</b></p>
<p>40. The national and political context renders it especially important to address issues 
of citizenship and civil status documentation in order to secure the human rights of all 
concerned persons. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, some of 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>those who have long settled in the country may not be protected from statelessness under 
the current nationality law or national documentation structures. The problem has been 
compounded by the disruption of the civil registry system during the many years of crisis in 
the country. UNHCR has cited government estimates that as many as 800,000 people fall 
within different categories of risk of statelessness, for which different remedies are 
recommended.21 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note partnership 
agreements between UNHCR and the Government of C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire which seek to prevent 
the risk of statelessness, including in the west of the country.  
</p>
<p>41. Additionally, an estimated 3 million children are without documentation of their 
birth. A presidential decree (No. 2011-258) issued in September 2011 provided for the 
possibility of delayed registration of births that could not be registered within the normal 90 
days because of disruption to the civil registry system between 2002 and the 2010 post-
election violence. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the measure, but notes that at its 
expiration on 30 July 2012, many children had still been unable to benefit from it. He urges 
the Government to extend the duration for delayed birth registrations, strengthen effective 
awareness-raising programmes at the community level on the importance of birth 
registrations, and consider abolishing all fees related to the registration and issuance of 
birth certificates. He further encourages the Government to ratify, at the earliest 
opportunity, the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the 1954 
Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Risk of evictions and secondary displacements of internally displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>42. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, some IDPs who 
either returned or relocated to areas in and around Abidjan, after the 2010 post-election 
violence as well as during previous crises, were at risk of eviction and secondary 
displacement from these locations. Some of the principal reasons for this included the 
inability of IDPs to continue renting their small shelters in the city (usually in informal 
settlements or &#8220;slums&#8221;) once the stipend they received to enable them to leave the IDP 
camp ran out, and a recent drive to empty &#8220;precarious&#8221; communities in and around the city 
which authorities deem unsafe due to the risk of natural hazards such as mudslides or 
flooding.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur found that IDPs who decided to stay in Abidjan (for 
reasons of safety or livelihoods) could generally only afford shelter for a few months in a 
one-room shack in the informal settlements in and around the city, and were now at risk of 
eviction. Several internally displaced families he met with in this situation included highly 
vulnerable persons, such as an elderly woman with a child with a disability, and single 
teenage mothers with infants. He also met internally displaced families who had moved 
there during earlier crises, some dating back to 2002, who had never been able to move 
from the informal settlement and find a better solution.  
</p>
<p>44. With regard to evictions related to hazard areas, the Government confirmed that it 
has been trying to take measures to vacate informal settlements considered at risk, 
including through awareness-raising and the establishment of a fund to facilitate the search 
for new dwellings.22 Concerns have been expressed however, that the funds available for 
these purposes are limited and will not be able to provide for more solid housing for many. 
Moreover, some residents expressed that they felt they were being targeted for evictions 
principally because of their proximity to wealthier or more visible parts of the financial

</b></p>
<p>capital which were in demand for development or other purposes, rather than for safety 
reasons.  
</p>
<p>45. There is, unfortunately, no reliable data on the number of affected communities or 
the number of IDPs who have either returned to or relocated to Abidjan and its 
surroundings throughout the nearly 10 years of conflict and displacement in the country. 
However, based on his visits to other countries with similar urban contexts that have also 
experienced protracted conflicts, the Special Rapporteur has observed that many IDPs tend 
to locally integrate in these precarious informal settlements due to lack of resources to 
secure better housing, only to be at risk of eviction and secondary displacement in the 
future. As in C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire, these settlements are often in areas prone to natural or other 
hazards, and lack security of tenure, rendering residents vulnerable to mass evictions for 
safety or development reasons, often without any alternative housing provided.23  
</p>
<p><b> B. Durable solutions  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Movements from camps and sites of internal displacement  
</b></p>
<p>46. At the time of the visit by the Special Rapporteur, no IDP camps remained in the 
country, and the estimated number of persons still internally displaced as a result of the 
2010 post-election violence had plummeted to 81,000. With the relative stability achieved 
by the summer of 2011, the majority of IDPs spontaneously either returned home or 
restarted their lives elsewhere. In addition to improved security, many were also motivated 
by the need to check on their homes and land and benefit from the planting season, while 
others were eventually encouraged by the provision of transportation and assurances they 
would receive assistance upon their return, especially for the rehabilitation of their homes. 
For those who remained longer in IDP sites in Abidjan (camps, churches or schools) due to 
fear of return or because they lacked the means or a house to return to, a subsistence 
allowance of a few months allowing them to leave the camp and rent accommodation 
elsewhere was provided, with assurances that small livelihood projects and microcredit 
programmes would follow. Some who received this allowance chose to locally integrate or 
resettle elsewhere in the country. However, at the time of the visit, many IDPs who had 
received this allowance had already exhausted it without any durable solutions in sight, and 
no livelihood and employment programmes had yet been implemented. More recently, the 
Special Rapporteur has been informed that income-generating projects have indeed started, 
although needs continue to outstrip the capacity to serve them.  
</p>
<p>47. While the Government generally appears to have upheld a policy of voluntary 
return, this was also accompanied by a policy of rapid camp site closures and 
encouragement of returns. In some cases, returnees were reportedly told or encouraged to 
return either by national civilian authorities, the FRCI, or priests and government 
authorities, who assured them of assistance, including food assistance, upon their return.24 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Measures to promote durable solutions  
</b></p>
<p>48. While the number of returns and the dismantling of IDP camps was considered an 
indicator of success by the Government,25 the Special Rapporteur believes that insufficient 
attention was paid to the establishment of conditions favourable to durable solutions, and in 
</p>
<p>

<p>particular to the special needs of vulnerable IDP groups (e.g., female-headed households)  
and those who had lost their homes and livelihoods, and to the needs of receiving 
communities, which in many cases were also in a dire situation and required support in 
order to absorb IDPs. Over a year after most returns had taken place, the Special 
Rapporteur found that for a large percentage of IDPs, the conditions for sustainable returns 
or other durable solutions had not yet been met and there continued to be significant 
humanitarian and development needs, including in relation to food security and shelter, 
infrastructure needs such as electricity and water, and access to basic services, as well as a 
critical lack of livelihoods. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn more recently that, 
while the cluster system has ended, a transitional protection working group continues to 
support the Government (under the auspices of prefectures) on a number of issues, 
including on coordination activities relating to documentation, social cohesion, land 
conflicts and protection monitoring, in areas of return and displacement. Moreover, 
protection monitoring activities are focusing increasingly on questions of durability of 
returns, and the strengthening of structures within UNOCI to ensure that the identification 
and response to acute protection needs can be followed up by appropriate actors. He is 
further encouraged that C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire has been selected as a pilot country for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Secretary-General&#8223;s decision and framework on durable solutions in 
post-conflict situations26 &#8211; a process which the Special Rapporteur strongly supports. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur also appreciates that some key issues relating to internal 
displacement and to the conditions conducive to durable solutions have been articulated in 
the National Development Plan (2012&#8211;2015), and urges the Government, with the support 
of key international stakeholders, to now give these the utmost priority. The Plan includes 
two key objectives in relation to the promotion of durable solutions, namely: (a) the 
consolidation of peace and social cohesion, such as through measures to ease inter-
community tensions, combat forms of exclusion and facilitate participation in the national 
reconciliation process; and (b) the provision of assistance to victims of the conflict (e.g. 
through mechanisms for compensation to IDPs, and by providing information on 
psychosocial assistance), their reintegration into their original communities and the 
rehabilitation of community infrastructures affected by the conflict.27 Some of the above 
objectives are further explained in the National Programme for Social Cohesion (2012&#8211;
2015), which details measures to be taken for the socioeconomic reintegration of vulnerable 
persons and other persons affected by the conflict, such as IDPs. According to this 
Programme, other activities to be undertaken towards this end seek to ensure the protection 
and security of IDPs in their places of residence, improvements in the assistance and care 
for vulnerable persons, and access to employment opportunities. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Security, civilian authority and rule of law  
</b></p>
<p>50. The sustainability of returns and other durable solutions is inextricably linked to 
the durability of peace and security in C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire, and particularly in the western part of 
the country, where the situation remains fragile. Many of the displacement-affected 
communities the Special Rapporteur met with during his visit to the west reported fears of 
retaliation and stated that they felt insecure due to the activities of FRCI elements and the 
Dozos, and expressed that they needed &#8220;a security and justice they could believe in&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>51. While civilian authority may have returned to many parts of the country, and a 
marked improvement in the reduction of checkpoints was visible at the time of the visit, in 
the west the FRCI continued to play a large role in policing and in the justice sector. 
</p>
<p>  
 26 See Policy Committee of the Secretary-General decision No. 2011/20, including the preliminary 
</p>
<p>framework on ending displacement in the aftermath of conflict.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Allegations and reports of serious human rights violations, including killings, extortion and 
arbitrary arrests by both FRCI elements and the Dozos,28 as well as allegations of 
collaboration between them in these crimes, have persisted. The Government issued a series 
of circulars intended to address the behaviour of security officials in May and June 2012, 
but the level of their implementation remains unclear.  
</p>
<p>52. In some pockets of the country, armed groups and individuals, some of whom 
claim to be pro-Gbagbo or pro-<i>autochtone</i>, have continued to put pressure and instigate 
armed attacks on local communities. Between April and June 2012, cross-border attacks on 
Sakr&#233;, Sao/Nigr&#233; and Si&#233;blo Oula, near the Liberian border, and in the western border area 
of Tai-Grabo, resulted in deaths and renewed mass displacements. The security situation in 
other parts of the country also remains fragile, with various attacks taking place in and 
around Abidjan, especially against FRCI, police and <i>gendarmerie</i> targets, as well as in 
Iroko, Pehekan Houebli (near the Liberian border) and the village of No&#233;, near the border 
with Ghana, during August and September 2012. As a result, some communities continue 
to experience periodic displacement after attacks, or when the security situation becomes 
more fragile due to changing militia or army movements, local conflicts or other factors. 
</p>
<p>53. During field visits by the Special Rapporteur in a return village in the west of the 
country, villagers described the recurrent attacks (seven in total) that had taken place, 
mostly in the night, against individuals in the village in early 2012. As a result, some 
villagers still practice pendular displacements, whereby they sleep in the bush at night and 
return to the village in the day, or when it appears safe to do so. The village had 
experienced killings and mass pillaging in 2002, and again in March 2011, after which 
many residents moved to Du&#233;kou&#233;, where they were also attacked. Both Dozos and 
elements of the FRCI were suspected in the recent attacks on the village. Similarly, in 
another village in the west, to which some former residents of the Nahibly IDP camp had 
recently returned, the Special Rapporteur was informed that villagers avoided leaving the 
village for fear of being attacked by either Dozos or FRCI elements, and some hid in the 
forest for the same reason, particularly when there were rumours of imminent attacks. In 
return villages and in his meetings with members of different community representatives 
and civil society groups in the west of the country, security remained the predominant 
concern, with fears that they continued to be perceived as pro-Gbagbo supporters and 
would be persecuted. Rumours of coordinated attacks against villages were frequently 
mentioned, further fuelling a climate of fear. In some villages with a history of inter-
community tensions, the Special Rapporteur found that the return of IDPs who wished to 
access lands could also exacerbate such tensions. 
</p>
<p>54. Despite the efforts of the United Nations police to undertake regular and extensive 
patrols, the size and forested density of the west and border areas, as well as the lack of 
sufficient personnel and equipment, render it difficult to provide complete and regular 
coverage. Similarly, protection and human rights monitoring activities by United Nations 
agencies, such as UNHCR, in the west and other parts of the country, are also challenged 
by the extensive areas to be covered and by limited capacity. The Special Rapporteur 
stresses the importance of supporting and strengthening these protection activities, which 
are essential to ensure the durability of returns to these areas and allow returnees to resume 
normal lives and their livelihood activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Housing, livelihoods and access to land  
</b></p>
<p>55. The occupation of land and the destruction of homes remains a serious challenge to 
sustainable returns of IDPs. This situation is vastly exacerbated by the broader context of

</p>
<p>land disputes in C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire, which has included volatile policy changes and political 
instrumentalization, and has contributed to the cycle of conflicts in the country, creating 
contention between &#8222;native&#8223; and &#8222;migrant&#8223; rights to land.29 With new waves of 
displacements and returns over the years, and changing power dynamics, new layers of 
occupation and land disputes have been added. In some cases, &#8222;native&#8223; Ivoirians occupying 
lands previously held by &#8222;migrants&#8223; who had fled during the 2002 conflict were then 
themselves displaced in the 2010 post-election violence, resulting in new waves of 
occupation by non-displaced or new migrants. During his visit to the west of the country, 
many IDPs and host communities the Special Rapporteur met with reported lack of access 
to land as a major concern, impacting their safety and their livelihoods.  
</p>
<p>56. Some IDPs living with extended family or friends in host communities reported 
being fearful of returning to their original villages due to occupation of their land by other 
groups. Others who had actually returned to their villages were allowed to remain there but 
were unable to access their land because it was being used by others, sometimes of a 
different ethnicity. According to one survey conducted in 2012, 50 per cent of people with 
land disputes experienced associated violence.30  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur found that the destruction of homes and farms during the 
post-election violence also continued to be a significant barrier to the sustainable return of 
IDPs. In the villages he visited in the west, returnees and community representatives 
stressed the severe need for the reconstruction of the homes that had been destroyed. While 
the village residents hosted the returnees, in many cases their own homes had also been 
damaged or destroyed. Some had built small, one-room makeshift shelters, which they now 
had to share with the returnees, so that 8 to 10 people sometimes shared this space. The 
Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn of the Emergency Programme for the 
Reintegration of Internally Displaced Persons in Du&#233;kou&#233;, officially launched in August 
2012, and which is part of the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance Project, supported by 
the World Bank.31 The Programme, which is aimed at ensuring that reconstruction activities 
support the reintegration of IDPs and contribute to social cohesion, is cross-sectoral in 
nature, requiring different government ministries to put in place the aspects of the project 
relevant to them. This includes the Ministry of Agriculture, which has been requested to 
take the necessary measures to facilitate the implementation of the land aspects of the 
project, which are particularly critical.32 While encouraged by this project, the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government and international community not to underestimate the 
extent and urgency of housing needs, especially in the west, which are estimated at over 
12,000 houses.33 Unmet shelter and housing needs result in overcrowding, exposure to the 
cold and lack of privacy, and pose particular protection problems for single female-headed 
households and young girls, who may be exposed to sexual abuse. In some villages he 
visited, the Special Rapporteur noted a disturbing and disproportionate number of underage 
pregnant girls or very young mothers, some appearing as young as 13 years of age.

<p><b> 5. Humanitarian needs, including food, access to basic services and livelihoods

<p>returned have had to rely on communities and family, who are in a dire situation 
themselves, to share with them the little they have in order to meet the bare necessities of 
life (food, shelter, clothes). A survey on durable solutions carried out in July 2011 in the 
Moyen-Cavally region found that returns had occurred under precarious conditions, and 
IDPs had not been provided the support necessary to ensure sustainable returns, with many 
remaining highly dependent on aid, especially if their lands were occupied.34 Of the 
returnees interviewed during that survey, 74 per cent identified food as their primary need, 
and over 60 per cent said that they relied on food aid.35  
</p>
<p>59. An assessment mission carried out nearly a year later by humanitarian actors 
working in the west of the country in June 2012 also identified significant humanitarian 
needs, including with regard to access to water and sanitation, health care, shelter and 
education, among the IDP population in Tai and other affected villages in the south-west. 
The continued risk of food insecurity was also confirmed, as many farmers were still unable 
to access their fields.36 A more recent evaluation of the situation in the west in November 
2012 estimated that 120,000 IDPs, and 32,000 returnees from Liberia are food insecure.37 
The lack of access to land has been closely tied to food insecurity for IDPs, since the 
majority of returnees had relied on their agricultural activities for their livelihoods before 
the post-election violence. A further 32 per cent engaged in small trade and 4 per cent had 
no revenue. However, by mid-2011, nearly 60 per cent of IDPs had no revenue. Among the 
most vulnerable were female-headed households, and widows who in many cases had lost 
all the family assets.38 The lack of civil identity documents and land tenure documents 
(where these existed), which may have been lost, destroyed or never issued, can also act as 
an impediment to livelihoods (e.g. in starting a business), initiating property claims or 
gaining access to other civil and socioeconomic rights.  
</p>
<p>60. Access to basic services, including health care, has also been affected by the post-
election violence, due to disruptions in supplies of medicine, looting and insecurity. Many 
displacement-affected communities the Special Rapporteur met with in the west said they 
did not have access to a functional health-care system for a variety of reasons, including 
distance to health-care points, the inability to pay for the services or medicine and the lack 
of medicine in dispensaries in their area. A survey carried out in mid-2011 found that 67 
per cent of those interviewed did not have effective access to health care, and that this was 
of particular concern in the area of maternal health.39  
</p>
<p>61. In the area of education, it is estimated that in the western part of the country, 
140,000 children missed out on their education in 2011, due to insecurity and the 
destruction and pillaging of school buildings.40 Education was also disrupted in the centre 
and east of the country, and in Abidjan. Even after the crisis, many young people who had 
dropped out of school because of the post-election violence have not been able to go back 
due to a lack of means. This has resulted in a high dropout rate, especially in the west of the 
country and Abidjan.41 The Special Rapporteur stresses that urgent measures are necessary 
to ensure that children, some of whom have seen their education repeatedly disrupted over

<p>the past decade, are provided with the necessary support to resume their education and, 
where necessary, to make up the years of lost schooling.  
</p>
<p>62. The question of the extent to which IDPs have found durable solutions to their 
displacement has remained unclear, not only for those displaced as a result of the more 
recent 2010 post-election violence, but also for those displaced by previous cycles of 
conflict. As such, the Special Rapporteur is especially encouraged by steps recently being 
undertaken by the Government and United Nations organizations to initiate a displacement 
profiling exercise,42 i.e., a data-collection exercise, on the durable solution needs and 
vulnerabilities of displacement-affected communities. This project will provide a much 
needed evidence base for humanitarian and development funding, and complement the 
implementation of the Secretary-General&#8223;s decision on durable solutions in C&#244;te d&#8223;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Protected forests and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>63. The achievement of durable solutions for IDPs coming from protected forests is 
particularly challenging, as a result of the legal status of these forests, which provides that 
settlement and plantations are not allowed in such areas. The Special Rapporteur has 
received information regarding IDPs who had originally settled in protected forests, in 
many cases without knowing it was illegal,43 and who were forced to flee as a result of the 
2002 conflict. While some agreements have been negotiated on a case-by-case basis to 
facilitate return, such as the 2008 Blol&#233;quin Agreement, this has been done largely in an ad 
hoc manner. Moreover, the 2010 post-election violence resulted in new widespread 
occupation in protected forests either from neighbours or new migrants, and a ban on entry 
to protected forests was proclaimed by the Prefect of Blol&#233;quin in 2012, both factors which 
can create obstacles to the return of persons displaced from protected forests during 
previous conflicts. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take all measures to 
mitigate the scope and effects of possible evictions from protected forests, to ensure that 
alternative solutions are provided and to facilitate durable solutions for affected 
communities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The </b>population of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has experienced a decade of multiple cris<b>es 
and displacement, due primarily to civil strife and conflict, which have been especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>accentuated since 2002. A number of other factors have fuelled the political crisis and 
</b></p>
<p><b>armed conflict, through their instrumentalization or the lack of solutions over the 
</b></p>
<p><b>years, including issues of land, citizenship and national identity, and inter-community 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicts. It is essential to address these issues in order to promote durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>for IDPs, and to provide protection against forced displacement in the future. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government has made some notable efforts towards re-establishing State structures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and law and order in the country. The security situation remains fragile however, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>has been affected by the slow progress in security sector reforms; disarmament, 
</b></p>
<p><b>demobilization and reintegration; and reconciliation efforts. The western part of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country in particular continues to be affected by cross-border attacks, inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>community tensions, banditry and reported human rights violations by elements of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the FRCI, Dozos and other armed elements. The slow return to full civilian authority

<p><b>in the west and the failure to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>also continue to perpetuate a climate of both actual and perceived insecurity, fear of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination and harassment, and persistent rumours of violent reprisals in 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement-affected communities.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>While it is a positive factor that the majority of IDPs returned spontaneously 
to their areas of origin or habitual residence within months of the end of the 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>post-election violence and that those remaining eventually left the camps and 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlements broadly on a voluntary basis, this has not been accompanied by a durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions strategy. As such, many IDPs and their host communities remain in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>precarious situation with regard to even their most basic needs. The destruction and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impoverishment resulting from the repeated waves of violence and displacement over 
</b></p>
<p><b>the last decade have reduced resilience and community structures and increased 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerability. Repeated displacements and returns have exacerbated contentious land 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues, especially in the west. In Abidjan, IDPs, many of whom have undergone 
</b></p>
<p><b>repeated displacements, have joined informal settlements in the city, with no security 
</b></p>
<p><b>of tenure, substandard housing and little access to public services. Many may face 
</b></p>
<p><b>eviction, as these settlements are on sites which may be targeted for development or 
</b></p>
<p><b>which are considered at risk of natural hazards. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>In view of the above, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations t</b>o the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  IDP legislative, policy and institutional frameworks  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Develop a comprehensive national policy, legislation and related institutional 
frameworks to address internal displacement, in line with the Guiding Principles on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Internal Displacement and the Kampala Convention, and ratify the latter at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>earliest opportunity. In t</b>he context of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, such a framework should place a 
</p>
<p><b>strong emphasis on prevention of internal displacement, durable solutions, eviction 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects related to development, conservation projects (e.g. protected forests) and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaster management.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Data collection on the humanitarian and durable solution needs of internally 
</b></p>
<p><b>displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Collect accurate, efficient and disaggregated data on the situation and 
continuing humanitarian, development and durable solutions needs of IDPs, and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>host/receiving communities. In this regard, give full support to the displacement-
</b></p>
<p><b>profiling project to be implemented in 2013, with the assistance of the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, and use information collected as an evidence base upon which to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>related national strategies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A comprehensive national durable solution strategy: to secure socioeconomic rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and promote livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Develop a comprehensive strategy to address the durable solution needs and 
dire living conditions of IDPs, with particular attention to vulnerable groups, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs of their host/receiving communities, and ensure coordination with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Secretary-</b>General&#8217;s decision on durable solutions, to be piloted in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. Such 
</p>
<p><b>a strategy should be founded, inter alia, on the principle of non-discrimination, </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>participation, on need and vulnerability, and include IDPs in both rural and urban 
</b></p>
<p><b>contexts.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The current humanitarian assistance and development needs of many IDPs 
continue to impede durable solutions, place vulnerable groups at risk of abuse and 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation, and exacerbate inter-community tensions. Strategies to address this 
</b></p>
<p><b>require: (a) measures to stabilize affected populations through short- and medium-
</b></p>
<p><b>term humanitarian and early-recovery activities; (b) the inclusion of displacement-
</b></p>
<p><b>affected communities in national development plans and livelihood projects; and (c) 
</b></p>
<p><b>strong cooperation between the humanitarian and development sectors.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Security, rule of law and reconciliation  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Finalize and implement comprehensive security sector reforms and a 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process which can address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>different groups and sources of insecurity, including non-State actors, banditry, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>illicit circulation of arms, ex-combatants, and areas in need of reform within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>security apparatus and the FRCI.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>With regard to the latter, reforms should include, inter alia; improved 
management of the FRCI, which ensures military hierarchy and discipline, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding its role in border areas or areas of ongoing militia activity; a vetting 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme that ensures that those accepted into the national army have a clean 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights record; and considerations relating to IDPs, including the need to gain 
</b></p>
<p><b>the trust of affected communities and build a culture of accountability and respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, especially in the west of the country.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Re-establish civilian authority, especially in the west, including by providing 
the police and the <i>gendarmerie</i> with the necessary resources to resume their rule-of-
</b></p>
<p><b>law and justice functions; strengthening rule-of-law infrastructures, legal services and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the judicial system; and ensuring that human rights violations, including against 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement-affected communities, are promptly investigated and the perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p><b>brought to justice, including in the case of the attack on the Nahibly IDP camp. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Provide the necessary political, human and financial support towards 
peacebuilding and reconciliation activities, including those of the Dialogue, Truth and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Reconciliation Commission. Such activities should include an outreach strategy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychosocial assistance, and broad-based participation by communities affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement in both recent and previous cycles of violence. The work of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission should include a thorough analysis of the root causes of conflict that is 
</b></p>
<p><b>accompanied by recommendations, including, inter alia, on areas requiring reforms, 
</b></p>
<p><b>key principles to govern such reforms (e.g. inclusiveness, human rights), compensation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and restitution for IDPs, and measures that can provide a guarantee of non-repetition 
</b></p>
<p><b>and safeguard human rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Land reform and related issues  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Facilitate the participation of IDP communities in the debate and process of 
land reform to ensure that considerations relating to displacement are integrated into 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant policies, decisions and laws. In particular: (a) review the 1998 land law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that IDPs can fully avail themselves of the law, without undue barriers, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>have their land rights dully recognized; (b) establish mechanisms to address the

<p><b>specific property disputes and issues which have resulted from displacement (e.g. 
</b></p>
<p><b>secondary occupation, compensation/restitution, inability to return to protected 
</b></p>
