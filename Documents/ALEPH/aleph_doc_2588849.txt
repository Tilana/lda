INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report includes “forward-looking statements” as defined by the SEC. Such statements include those concerning
strategic plans, our expectations and objectives for future operations, as well as other future events or conditions, and are
often identified by use of the words “expects,” “believes,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “forecasts,” “projections,” “estimates,” “plans,”
“expectations,” “targets,” “opportunities,” “potential,” “anticipates,” “outlook” and other similar terminology. Such forward-
looking statements are based on our examination of historical operating trends, the information used to prepare our
December 31, 2015 reserve reports and other data in our possession or available from third parties. Such statements are
subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Consequently, actual
future results could differ materially from our expectations due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
·the volatility of oil, gas and NGL prices, including the currently depressed commodity price environment;
 ·uncertainties inherent in estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves;
 ·the extent to which we are successful in acquiring and discovering additional reserves;
 ·the uncertainties, costs and risks involved in exploration and development activities;
 ·risks related to our hedging activities;
 ·counterparty credit risks;
 ·regulatory restrictions, compliance costs and other risks relating to governmental regulation, including with respect to
environmental matters;
 ·risks relating to our indebtedness;
 ·our ability to successfully complete mergers, acquisitions and divestitures;
 ·the extent to which insurance covers any losses we may experience;
 ·our limited control over third parties who operate some of our oil and gas properties;
 ·midstream capacity constraints and potential interruptions in production;
 ·competition for leases, materials, people and capital;
 ·cyberattacks targeting our systems and infrastructure; and
 ·any of the other risks and uncertainties discussed in this report, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings
with the SEC.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Devon, or persons acting on its behalf, are
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. We assume no duty to update or revise our forward-
looking statements based on new information, future events or otherwise.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and notes of Devon have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and
notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in Devon’s 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements furnished in this report reflect all adjustments that are, in the
opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of Devon’s results of operations and cash flows for the three-month
and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and Devon’s financial position as of June 30, 2016.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-
Based Payment Accounting. Its objective is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments,
including accounting for income taxes when awards vest or are settled, statutory withholding and accounting for forfeitures.
Classification of these aspects on the statement of cash flows is also addressed. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning
January 1, 2017. Devon is evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures and does not plan on early adopting.
The FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU will supersede the revenue
recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605, Extractive
Activities – Oil and Gas – Revenue Recognition. This ASU provides guidance concerning the recognition and measurement
of revenue from contracts with customers. Its objective is to increase the usefulness of information in the financial statements
regarding the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues. The effective date for ASU 2014-09 was delayed through the
issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Deferral of the Effective Date, to annual and interim
periods beginning in 2018, with early adoption permitted in 2017. The ASU is required to be adopted using either the
retrospective transition method, which requires restating previously reported results or the cumulative effect (modified
retrospective) transition method, which utilizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption
to account for prior period effects rather than restating previously reported results. Devon intends to use the cumulative effect
transition method and is evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. Devon does not plan on early adopting.
The FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU will supersede the lease requirements in Topic 840, Leases.
Its objective is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. This ASU provides guidance requiring
lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet. Lessor accounting does not significantly change from Topic 840,
except for some changes made to align with Topic 606. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning January 1, 2019 and will
be applied using a modified retrospective transition method, which requires applying the new guidance to leases that exist or
are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. Devon is
evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and does not plan
on early adopting.
2.Acquisitions and Divestitures
Devon Acquisitions
On January 7, 2016, Devon acquired approximately 80,000 net acres and assets in the STACK play for approximately $1.5
billion, subject to certain adjustments. Devon funded the acquisition with $847 million of cash and $659 million of common
equity shares. The allocation of the purchase price at June 30, 2016 was approximately $1.3 billion to unproved properties
and approximately $200 million to proved properties.

EnLink Acquisitions
On January 7, 2016, EnLink acquired Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets, along with dedicated
acreage service rights and service contracts, for approximately $1.5 billion, subject to certain adjustments. EnLink funded the
acquisition with approximately $215 million of General Partner common units and approximately $800 million of cash,
primarily funded with the issuance of EnLink preferred units. The remaining $500 million of the purchase price is to be paid
within one year with the option to defer $250 million of the final payment 24 months from the close date. The first $250 million
of undiscounted future installment payment is reported in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets with the remaining $250 million payment reported in other long-term liabilities. The accretion of the discount is
reported within net financing costs in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statement of earnings. A preliminary
allocation of the purchase price at June 30, 2016 was $1.0 billion to intangible assets and $420 million to property and
equipment.
On August 1, 2016, EnLink formed a joint venture to operate and expand its midstream assets in the Delaware Basin. The
joint venture is initially owned 50.1% by EnLink and 49.9% by the joint venture partner. EnLink contributed approximately
$230 million of existing assets to the joint venture and committed an additional $285 million in capital to fund potential future
development projects and potential acquisitions. The joint venture partner committed an aggregate of approximately $400
million of capital, including an initial contribution of approximately $115 million, and granted to EnLink call rights beginning
in 2021 to acquire increasing portions of the joint venture partner’s interest.
Devon Asset Divestitures
In December 2015, Devon announced its intent to divest certain non-core upstream assets in the U.S. and its interest in the
Access Pipeline in Canada. Proceeds from these divestitures are expected to be used primarily for debt repayment and to
support capital investment in Devon’s core resource plays.
On June 30, 2016, Devon sold its Mississippian assets for $200 million, subject to certain adjustments. Estimated proved
reserves associated with these assets were approximately 11 MMBoe, or less than 1% of total U.S. proved reserves. Under
full cost accounting rules, sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties are generally accounted for as adjustments to
capitalized costs, with no recognition of a gain or loss. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the Mississippian
assets.
During the second quarter of 2016, Devon entered into definitive agreements to divest approximately $1.8 billion of non-core
assets located primarily in east Texas, the Anadarko Basin and the Midland Basin to five separate purchasers. Through
August 3, 2016, Devon has closed approximately $1.2 billion of the announced asset divestitures. Devon expects to close
the remaining transactions in the third quarter of 2016. Devon is evaluating whether the impact of these divestitures will
result in an adjustment to its capitalized costs or in the recognition of a gain in the consolidated statement of earnings.
As of June 30, 2016, Devon held approximately $95 million in cash related to the pending transactions. The cash deposits
are restricted until the closing of the transactions. As a result, Devon has classified these amounts in other current assets and
other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Assets held for sale
In July 2016, Devon reached an agreement to sell its interest in the Access Pipeline for $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion Canadian
dollars). The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016. As of June 30, 2016, Devon’s Access Pipeline
assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale. Upon this classification change, Devon ceased recording depreciation
on Access Pipeline. Based on the contracted sales price, no fair value adjustment to the carrying value of these assets and
liabilities was warranted at June 30, 2016, and Devon expects to recognize a gain of approximately $400 million to $600
million upon the closing of the sale. Under the terms of the related transportation agreement, Devon’s Canadian thermal-oil
acreage is dedicated to Access Pipeline for an initial term of 25 years. A market-based toll will be applied to production from
Devon’s thermal-oil projects.

3.Derivative Financial Instruments
Objectives and Strategies
Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production to
hedge future prices received. Additionally, Devon and EnLink periodically enter into derivative financial instruments with
respect to a portion of their oil, gas and NGL marketing activities. These commodity derivative financial instruments include
financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options. Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps
to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates. As of June 30, 2016, Devon did not have any open foreign
exchange contracts.
Devon does not intend to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and has elected not
to designate any of its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment.
As of December 31, 2015, Devon’s other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet included $236
million of accrued settlements that it received in January 2016.
Counterparty Credit Risk
By using derivative financial instruments, Devon is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to
perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of
counterparties whom Devon believes are acceptable credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only
with investment-grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers.
Additionally, Devon’s derivative contracts generally contain provisions that provide for collateral payments, if Devon’s or its
counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels.
As of December 31, 2015, Devon held $75 million of cash collateral which represented the estimated fair value of certain
derivative positions in excess of Devon’s credit guidelines. The collateral is reported in other current liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Commodity Derivatives
As of June 30, 2016, Devon had the following open oil derivative positions. The first table presents Devon’s oil derivatives
that settle against the average of the prompt month NYMEX WTI futures price. The second table presents Devon’s oil

Oil and Gas Impairments
Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and deferred
income taxes, may not exceed the full cost “ceiling” at the end of each quarter. The ceiling is calculated separately for each
country and is based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at
10% per annum, net of related tax effects. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an
unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months.
The oil and gas impairments resulted from declines in the U.S. and Canada full cost ceilings. The lower ceiling values
resulted primarily from significant decreases in the 12-month average trailing prices for oil, bitumen, gas and NGLs, which
significantly reduced proved reserves values and, to a lesser degree, proved reserves.
EnLink Goodwill Impairments
In the first quarter of 2016, Devon recognized goodwill impairments related to EnLink’s business. Additional information
regarding the impairments is discussed in Note 13.

Reduction in Workforce
In the first six months of 2016, Devon recognized $236 million in employee-related costs associated with a reduction in
workforce that was made in response to the depressed commodity price environment. Of these employee-related costs,
approximately $67 million resulted from accelerated vesting of share-based grants, which are noncash charges. Additionally,
approximately $30 million resulted from estimated defined benefit settlements. These cash and noncash charges included
estimates for employees released from service during the first six months of 2016, as well as amounts based on the number
of employees expected to be impacted by certain of its non-core asset divestitures. Devon expects to complete these
pending divestitures in the third quarter of 2016.
As a result of the reduction in workforce and asset divestitures, Devon ceased using certain office space that was subject to
non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Consequently, Devon recognized $17 million of restructuring costs that
represent the present value of its future obligations under the leases. Additionally, Devon recognized $3 million of asset
impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space it ceased using.
Transaction Costs
In the first six months of 2016, Devon and EnLink recognized transaction costs primarily associated with the closing of the
acquisitions discussed in Note 2.

Devon estimates its annual effective income tax rate in recording its quarterly provision for income taxes in the various
jurisdictions in which it operates. Statutory tax rate changes and other significant or unusual items are recognized as discrete
items in the quarter in which they occur.
At December 31, 2015, Devon recorded a 100%, or $967 million, valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets
that largely resulted from the full cost impairments recognized during 2015. Through the first six months of 2016, Devon
provided an additional $1.3 billion valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets due to its continued financial
losses incurred largely by the additional full cost impairments.
In the first quarter of 2016, EnLink recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately $873 million. This impairment is not
deductible for purposes of calculating income tax and therefore has an impact on the effective tax rate.
Devon and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various state and
foreign jurisdictions. Devon’s tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing
authority. Devon is under audit in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business.

13.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Devon performs an annual impairment test of goodwill at October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. Sustained weakness in the overall
energy sector driven by low commodity prices, together with a decline in EnLink’s unit price, caused a change in
circumstances warranting an interim impairment test of EnLink’s reporting units in the first quarter of 2016. Based on that test,
EnLink recorded a noncash goodwill impairment of $873 million. This consisted of a full impairment charge of $93 million
related to its Crude and Condensate reporting unit and partial impairment to its Texas and General Partner reporting units of
$473 million and $307 million, respectively.
Other Intangible Assets
The following table presents other intangible assets reported in other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. See Note 2 for discussion of changes in other intangible assets resulting from EnLink acquisitions during

as of December 31, 2015 consists of $626 million of commercial paper and $350 million floating rate due on
December 15, 2016.
As of January 1, 2016, Devon adopted ASU 2015-03, Interest – Imputation of Interest (Topic 835): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This ASU requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be
presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an
asset. As a result of the adoption, Devon reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of $81 million as of December 31,
2015 from other long-term assets to a reduction of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.
Commercial Paper
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Devon reduced commercial paper borrowings by $626 million. As of June 30,
2016, Devon had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
Credit Lines
Devon has a $3.0 billion Senior Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, there were $66 million in outstanding letters of credit
and no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant.
This covenant requires Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no
greater than 65%. Under the terms of the credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial
write-downs such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of June 30, 2016, Devon was in compliance
with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.1%.

EnLink Debt
All of EnLink’s and the General Partner’s debt is non-recourse to Devon.
EnLink has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, there were $11 million in outstanding
letters of credit and $697 million in outstanding borrowings at an average rate of 2.12% under the $1.5 billion credit facility.
The General Partner has a $250 million secured revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, the General Partner had $15
million in outstanding borrowings at an average rate of 4.25%. EnLink and the General Partner were in compliance with all
financial covenants in their respective credit facilities as of June 30, 2016.
In July 2016, EnLink issued $500 million of 4.85% unsecured senior notes due 2026. EnLink intends to use the net proceeds
to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.

18.Noncontrolling Interests
Subsidiary Equity Transactions
During the first quarter of 2016, EnLink issued common units in conjunction with the acquisition discussed in Note 2. In
addition, during the first six months of 2016, EnLink issued approximately 3 million common units for net proceeds of $52
million. As a result of these transactions, Devon’s ownership interest in EnLink decreased from 28% at December 31, 2015
to 24% at June 30, 2016, excluding the interest held by the General Partner. Additionally, as a result of the transaction
described in Note 2, Devon’s ownership in the General Partner decreased from 70% to 64% during the same time period.
The net gains and losses and related income taxes resulting from these transactions have been recorded as an adjustment
to equity, with the change in ownership reflected as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests.
Distributions to Noncontrolling Interests
EnLink and the General Partner distributed $147 million and $118 million to non-Devon unitholders during the first six
months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

19.Commitments and Contingencies
Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable
outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known
about the matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling
similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to
Devon’s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals. Actual amounts could differ
materially from management’s estimates.
Royalty Matters
Numerous oil and natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging
royalty underpayments. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below-market prices, made improper
deductions, used improper measurement techniques and entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with
affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with oil, natural gas and NGLs produced and sold. Devon is
also involved in governmental agency proceedings and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary
course of business, some that may lead to additional royalty claims. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to
material exposure with respect to such royalty matters.
Environmental Matters
Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past
operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state
statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss accruals primarily consist of estimated uninsured
remediation costs. Devon’s monetary exposure for environmental matters is not expected to be material.
Other Matters
Devon is involved in other various legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge, there were
no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values in the table above.
Level 1 Fair Value Measurements
Cash equivalents – Amounts consist primarily of money market investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.
Level 2 Fair Value Measurements
Cash equivalents – Amounts consist primarily of commercial paper and Canadian agency and provincial securities
investments. The fair value approximates the carrying value.
Commodity, interest rate and foreign currency derivatives – The fair values of commodity, interest rate and foreign currency
derivatives are estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained
from independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements.
Debt – Devon’s debt instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The fair values of its debt are estimated
based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity. The fair values of commercial paper and credit facility
balances are the carrying values.

DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Unaudited)
Installment payment – The fair value of the EnLink installment payment as of June 30, 2016 was based on Level 2 inputs
from third-party market quotations.
Capital lease obligations – The fair value was calculated using inputs from third-party banks.
21.Segment Information
Devon manages its operations through distinct operating segments, which are defined primarily by geographic areas. For
financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment due to the similar
nature of the businesses. However, Devon’s Canadian E&P operating segment is reported as a separate reporting segment
primarily due to the significant differences between the U.S. and Canadian regulatory environments. Devon’s U.S. and
Canadian segments are both primarily engaged in oil and gas E&P activities.
Devon considers EnLink, combined with the General Partner, to be an operating segment that is distinct from the U.S. and
Canadian operating segments. EnLink’s operations consist of midstream assets and operations located across the U.S.
Additionally, EnLink has a management team that is primarily responsible for capital and resource allocation decisions.
Therefore, EnLink is presented as a separate reporting segment.

(1)Core earnings (loss) and core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon are financial measures not prepared in
accordance with GAAP. For a description of core earnings (loss) and core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon,
as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-GAAP Measures” in this Item 2.
(2)Core production is comprised of production in our key operating areas as outlined in our “Oil, Gas and NGL Production”
table in this Item 2.
(3)Excludes any impact of oil, gas and NGL derivatives.
(4)Except for balance sheet amounts, which are presented as of June 30.
During the first six months of 2016, commodity prices continued to be volatile. The WTI oil price has ranged from
approximately $30/Bbl to $50/Bbl and NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices have ranged from approximately $1.75/Mcf to
$3.00/Mcf in 2016. As compared to the first quarter of 2016, we have seen moderate improvements in the commodity price
environment; however, commodity prices are substantially lower than the second quarter of 2015. Despite the improvements
over the first quarter of 2016, relatively low prices remained a challenge for us and the upstream energy sector. In spite of
this, we have continued to execute on our strategy and position our company for long-term success. To that end, we have
taken financial and operational steps during 2016 by making prudent investments and upgrades to our portfolio of assets,
bringing the value of certain non-core oil and gas assets forward through divestiture, further optimizing our production
operations to minimize production declines and controlling costs to strengthen our balance sheet. Specifically, we had
several key achievements:
·Expanded our position in the STACK by acquiring approximately 80,000 net acres and assets for $1.5 billion.
 ·Reduced exploratory and developmental capital investment by 69% as compared to the first six months of 2015.
 ·Raised net proceeds of $1.5 billion in an offering of our common stock.
 ·
Entered into agreements totaling $3.2 billion to sell non-core assets across our portfolio, surpassing the top end of our
Entered into agreements totaling $3.2 billion to sell non-core assets across our portfolio, surpassing the top end of our
guidance range. These agreements include our non-core Mississippian, east Texas, Anadarko Basin and Midland Basin
assets, bringing total E&P non-core transactions to $2.1 billion. Subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into an agreement
to sell our interest in the Access Pipeline for $1.1 billion.
 ·Raised 2016 production guidance for core assets by 3%.
30
·Reduced LOE by $28 million or 6% as compared to the first quarter of 2016 and by $146 million or 26% compared to the
second quarter of 2015. 
 ·Reduced gross G&A by $67 million as compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily through cost reduction initiatives
resulting from our February 2016 workforce reduction, the full benefits of which have yet to be realized. Through the first six
months of 2016, our gross G&A is approximately $200 million lower than the same time period in 2015. The reductions are
expected to decrease gross G&A costs by approximately $400 million on an annualized basis.
 ·Exited the second quarter of 2016 with $4.6 billion of liquidity, consisting of $1.7 billion of cash and $2.9 billion of capacity
on our Senior Credit Facility. We have managed our debt maturity schedule to provide maximum flexibility with near-term
liquidity; we have no major long-term debt maturities until December 2018.
In conjunction with the workforce reduction and transactions discussed above, we incurred $271 million of restructuring and
transaction costs in the first six months of 2016. Additionally, during the first six months of 2016, we recognized $4.5 billion of
asset impairments related to the continued depressed prices for commodities. While these impairments significantly
impacted our earnings, they had no effect on our operating cash flow or debt covenants.

Oil, gas and NGL sales decreased due to a change in production volumes during the second quarter and the first six months
of 2016. While continued development of our Delaware Basin and our enhanced positions in the STACK drove production
increases, these increases were more than offset by reduced completion activity in the Eagle Ford and natural production
declines in the Barnett Shale and in our non-core properties. Additionally, our bitumen production increased primarily due to
Jackfish 3 exceeding nameplate capacity in the first six months of 2016.
Oil, bitumen, gas and NGL sales decreased in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 due to significant price
decreases for all commodities. The decrease in oil and bitumen sales resulted from lower average WTI crude oil index
prices, which were 26% lower than the first six months of 2015. The decreases in gas and NGL sales were due to lower
North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based and lower NGL prices at the Mont Belvieu, Texas
hub.

Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to various commodity
derivatives. In addition to cash settlements, we also recognize fair value changes on our oil, gas and NGL derivative
instruments in each reporting period. The changes in fair value resulted from new positions and settlements that occurred
during each period, as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves. Including the
cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas
34
and NGL derivatives incurred net losses in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015. Including the cash settlements discussed
above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives incurred a net loss in the first six months of 2016 and generated a net gain in the first
six months of 2015.

The overall decrease in marketing and midstream margin in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily due to lower margins
on Devon’s downstream marketing commitments. The overall decrease in the marketing and midstream margin in the six
months ended period was due to lower margins on Devon’s downstream marketing commitments partially offset by EnLink’s
acquisition activity in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.

LOE and LOE per Boe decreased during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 primarily due to our well
optimization and cost reduction initiatives and changes in the Canadian to U.S. foreign exchange rate. Our cost reduction
initiatives have been primarily focused on reducing costs associated with water disposal, power and fuel, compression and
workovers.
Upon closing the Access Pipeline divestiture discussed in Note 2 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial
Statements,” we expect LOE to increase approximately $35 million to $40 million in the last six months of 2016 as a result of
our transportation commitment on the pipeline.

Gross G&A and capitalized G&A decreased during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 largely due to lower
Devon employee costs resulting from recent workforce reductions, as discussed in Note 6 in “Part I. Financial Information –
Item 1. Financial Statements,” and other cost reduction initiatives. Reimbursed G&A decreased primarily due to a reduction
in drilling activity in response to the decline in commodity prices.

Production taxes decreased during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 on an absolute dollar basis primarily
due to a decrease in our U.S. revenues, on which the majority of our production taxes are assessed. Furthermore, property
and other taxes decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of lower property value assessments from the local taxing
authorities across our key operating areas. Property taxes do not change in direct correlation with the decline in oil, gas and
NGL sales, and are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.

DD&A from our oil and gas properties decreased in the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 compared to the
second quarter and the first six months of 2015 largely due to lower DD&A rates, as a result of the oil and gas asset
impairments recognized in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Other DD&A increased primarily due to EnLink’s acquisitions
in 2016 and 2015.
Asset Impairments
We recognized asset impairments during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 and 2015. For further
discussion, see Note 5 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report.
Restructuring and Transaction Costs
During the first six months of 2016, we recognized restructuring costs of $256 million as a result of the workforce reductions,
which were driven by our cost reduction initiatives and anticipated divestitures of non-core properties. These restructuring
costs include estimated employee-related cash and non-cash severance costs afforded under the terms of our severance
policy. When estimating these costs, certain assumptions were made with respect to the timing of employee terminations and
the number of employees that may receive employment offers from the purchasers of our divested assets. Based on the
percentage of employees receiving offers from purchasers through the date of this report, we do not expect to incur
significant additional severance costs related to the pending divestiture transactions. In addition, we incurred lease
obligation costs due to non-cancellable operating lease agreements and asset impairments related to the vacated office
space. See Note 6 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report.
36
During the first six months of 2016, we recognized transaction costs of $15 million, primarily associated with the closing of
the acquisitions discussed in Note 2 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report.

Net financing costs increased during the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 primarily due to an increase in
Devon and EnLink fixed-rate borrowings and accretion of future installment payments related to EnLink acquisition activity in
the first quarter of 2016. For further discussion of the accretion of future installment payments, see Note 2 in “Part I. Financial
Information – Item 1. Financial Statements.”
As discussed in “Liquidity” in this Item 2. we anticipate using a portion of divestiture proceeds for debt repayment. Upon
repayment of outstanding debt, and excluding one-time costs we expect to incur upon retirement, we would expect a decline
in net financing costs in future reporting periods. The extent of the decline will be largely dependent upon the timing of
closing the divestiture transactions, as well as the amount and timing of debt retired. As such, we are unable to estimate the
magnitude of the impact of debt repayments on net financing costs at this time.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 82% primarily due to lower commodity prices and the impact of cash
settlements associated with our commodity derivatives during 2015.
Excluding payments made for acquisitions, our consolidated operating cash flow funded 39% and 87% of our capital
expenditures during the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, leveraging our liquidity, we also used cash
balances and proceeds from our common stock offering to fund our acquisitions and capital expenditures.
Issuance of Common Stock
In February 2016, we issued 79 million shares of our common stock to the public, inclusive of 10 million shares sold as part
of the underwriters’ option. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.5 billion.
Divestitures of Property and Equipment
On June 30, 2016, we sold our non-core Mississippian assets for approximately $200 million. For further discussion, see
Note 2 in “Part 1. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements.”

Capital expenditures consist of amounts related to our oil and gas exploration and development operations, midstream
operations, other corporate activities and EnLink growth and maintenance activities. The vast majority of Devon’s capital
expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties. In response to lower commodity
prices, Devon’s 2016 capital program is designed to be substantially lower than 2015, evidenced by a 69% decrease in
exploration and development costs from the first six months of 2015 as well as a 53% decrease from the last six months of
2015 to the first six months of 2016.
Capital expenditures for Devon’s and EnLink’s midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of oil
and gas gathering facilities and pipelines. Midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling and
development activities.
Acquisition capital for the first six months of 2016 primarily consisted of Devon’s acquisition of assets in the STACK play for
approximately $1.5 billion and EnLink’s acquisition of Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets for $1.5
billion. Approximately $847 million and $800 million, respectively, was paid in cash at the closings with the remainder of the
purchase prices funded with equity consideration and debt. For additional information, see Note 2 in “Part I. Financial
Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report.
Debt Activity, Net
During the first six months of 2016, we reduced our debt by $329 million. The decrease was primarily due to reducing our
commercial paper balances by $626 million partially offset by EnLink’s increased credit facility borrowings to fund
acquisitions and growth capital expenditures.
In June 2015, we issued $750 million of 5.0% senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay the aggregate principal
amount of our December 15, 2015 floating rate senior notes, as well as outstanding commercial paper balances. Our net
debt borrowings during the first six months of 2015 increased $767 million, which was primarily due to EnLink borrowings
made to fund acquisitions and dropdowns.

Shareholder and Noncontrolling Interests Distributions
The following table summarizes our common stock dividends during the first six months of 2016 and 2015. In the second

EnLink and General Partner Distributions
Devon received $133 million and $137 million in distributions from EnLink and the General Partner during the first six
months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
EnLink Dropdowns
In the second quarter of 2015, Devon received $171 million in cash from EnLink in exchange for VEX.
Issuance of Subsidiary Units
In February 2016, as part of its acquisition of Anadarko Basin gathering and processing midstream assets, EnLink issued
50 million preferred units in a private placement generating proceeds of approximately $725 million. Also in conjunction with
this acquisition, the General Partner issued 15.6 million of common units with an aggregate value of $215 million.
Additionally, during the first six months of 2016, EnLink issued 3 million common units for net proceeds of $52 million.
Sale of Subsidiary Units
In March 2015, we conducted an underwritten secondary public offering of 23 million common units representing limited
partner interests in EnLink, raising proceeds of $569 million, net of underwriting discount. In April 2015, as part of the
secondary public offering, underwriters fully exercised their option to purchase an additional 3.4 million common units,
raising $85 million of net proceeds.
Liquidity
Historically, our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been our operating cash flow and cash on hand. Additionally,
we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to
supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. Available sources of capital and liquidity include, among others, debt
and equity securities that can be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, as well as the sale of
a portion of our common units representing interests in our investment in EnLink and the General Partner. The most
significant source of liquidity in 2016 will come from proceeds related to our asset divestitures. Through August 3, 2016 we
have closed approximately $1.2 billion of the announced asset divestitures. We expect to close the remaining transactions in
the third quarter of 2016. We estimate the combination of these sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund future
capital expenditures, debt repayments and other contractual commitments.
40
Operating Cash Flow
Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which are the prices of the oil, bitumen, gas and
NGLs we produce and sell. Our consolidated operating cash flow decreased 82% in the first six months of 2016 compared to
the first six months of 2015 as a result of the significant decreases in commodity prices, as well as in the settlement value of
our hedge contracts. In spite of this decline, we expect operating cash flow to continue to be a key source of liquidity as we
adjust our capital program in response to lower commodity prices. Additionally, we anticipate utilizing divestiture proceeds
and our credit availability to provide additional liquidity as needed.
To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our
production against downside price risk. For additional information, see Note 3 in “Part I. Financial Information – Item 1.
Financial Statements” in this report.
Capital Expenditures
With the success of the non-core asset divestitures discussed below, we increased our estimated capital program spending
$200 million. Excluding acquisitions and EnLink, our 2016 capital expenditures are expected to range from $1.4 billion to
$1.6 billion, including $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for our oil and gas capital program.
Credit Availability
As of June 30, 2016, we had $66 million in outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under our $3.0 billion
Senior Credit Facility. This credit facility supports our $3.0 billion commercial paper program. At June 30, 2016, we had no
outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total
funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than 65%. As of June 30, 2016, we
were in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 23.1%.
EnLink has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, and the General Partner has a $250 million secured revolving
credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, there were $11 million in outstanding letters of credit and $697 million in outstanding
borrowings under the $1.5 billion credit facility, and the General Partner had $15 million in outstanding borrowings under the
$250 million credit facility.
Asset Divestitures
In December 2015, we announced our intent to divest our interest in the Access Pipeline and certain non-core upstream
assets targeting total proceeds of $2 billion to $3 billion. During the second quarter of 2016, we closed the divestiture of our
Mississippian assets for approximately $200 million. Additionally, in June 2016, we entered into definitive agreements to sell
the remaining upstream assets in the U.S. for approximately $1.8 billion. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we
entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 50% ownership interest in the Access Pipeline for approximately $1.1 billion.
The remaining transactions have or are expected to close in the third quarter of 2016 and will conclude our divestitures with
expected proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion, surpassing the top end of our guidance range. We anticipate using a
portion of these asset divestiture proceeds for debt repayment in the second half of 2016.
EnLink Capital Resources and Expenditures
In January 2016, EnLink acquired additional gathering and processing midstream assets in the Anadarko Basin for
approximately $1.5 billion in cash and equity, subject to certain adjustments. The first installment of $1.02 billion for the
acquisition was paid at closing, and the final installment of $500 million is due no later than the first anniversary of the
closing date, with the option to defer $250 million of the final installment up to 24 months following the closing date.
Debt Ratings
We receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the U.S. In determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a
number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality,
reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales, near-term and long-term production growth opportunities and
capital allocation challenges. In February 2016, our credit rating was revised by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services from
BBB+ with a negative outlook to BBB with a stable outlook. In March 2016, Fitch Ratings affirmed our BBB+ rating but
revised our outlook from
41
stable to negative. In July 2016, Moody’s Investor Service revised our senior unsecured rating from Ba2 with negative
outlook to a stable outlook.
There are no “rating triggers” in any of our or EnLink’s contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled
maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. However, these downgrades could adversely impact our and
EnLink’s interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.
Contractual Obligations
As discussed in Note 2 in “Part 1. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” of this report, we reached an
agreement to sell our 50% interest in the Access Pipeline. Under the terms of the agreement, we dedicated our thermal-oil
acreage to Access Pipeline for an initial term of 25 years. Upon closing of the transaction in the third quarter of 2016, we
expect our annualized LOE to increase approximately $100 million.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Full Cost Method of Accounting and Proved Reserves
Under the full cost method of accounting, sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties are generally accounted for as
adjustments to capitalized costs, with no recognition of a gain or loss. The determination of whether a gain or loss is to be
recognized is dependent upon whether the disposition significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves, the conclusion of which involves a significant amount of judgment. We are evaluating whether the pending
non-core oil and gas property divestiture transactions discussed in Note 2 in “Part 1. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial
Statements” of this report will result in the recognition of a gain. The final determination will largely depend on factors such
as how and whether the disposal transactions are aggregated.
We perform a full cost ceiling impairment test each quarter for our U.S. and Canadian oil and gas properties. The ceiling
tests for the first six months of 2016 resulted in recognizing ceiling impairments on our U.S. and Canadian properties totaling
$3.7 billion.
Depending on the relationship between our capitalized costs and calculated full cost ceiling at the time of the most recent
ceiling test performed, uncertain future prices limit our ability to predict and measure potential future full cost impairments.
However, because the ceiling test computation uses a 12-month trailing price to determine future cash flows, we can
typically predict when circumstances will result in future impairments that are material, particularly in the next one to two
quarters. However, due to the nature of estimating future cash flows, measuring any potential impairments is more difficult.
Based on prices from the last nine months of the trailing 12-month average and the short-term pricing outlook for the third
quarter of 2016 and an assumption that we complete the Access Pipeline divestiture in the third quarter, we expect to
recognize an additional Canadian full cost impairment in the third quarter of 2016. We expect the impairment on our
Canadian oil and gas properties to approximate amounts recognized in the first and second quarter of 2016. As discussed
above, we are currently evaluating the accounting impact of the U.S. divestiture transactions, which would impact the amount
of any impairment recorded on our U.S. full cost pool. Our full cost impairments have no effect on liquidity or capital
resources. However, they adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized.
Goodwill
We test goodwill for impairment annually at October 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that
the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Sustained weakness in the overall energy sector driven by low
commodity prices, together with a decline in the EnLink unit price, caused a change in circumstances warranting an interim
impairment test for EnLink’s reporting units.
The goodwill assessment is performed at the reporting unit level and primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis,
supplemented by a market approach analysis in the assessment. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an
appropriate discount rate, terminal year multiples and estimated future cash flows, including volume forecasts and estimated
operating and G&A costs. In estimating cash flows, current and historical market information, among other factors, are
incorporated.
Using the fair value approaches described above, in the first quarter of 2016 it was determined that the estimated fair value of
EnLink’s Texas, General Partner and Crude and Condensate reporting units were less than their carrying amounts, primarily
due to changes in assumptions related to commodity prices and discount rates. Through the analysis, a goodwill impairment
loss of $473
42
million, $307 million and $93 million for EnLink’s Texas, General Partner and Crude and Condensate reporting units,
respectively, was recognized in the first quarter of 2016.
As of March 31, 2016, the goodwill allocated to the Crude and Condensate reporting unit was fully impaired. Other than
those mentioned above, no other goodwill impairment was identified or recorded for the remaining reporting units as a result
of the interim goodwill assessment, as their estimated fair values were in excess of carrying values. However, the fair value
of EnLink’s Texas and General Partner reporting units are not substantially in excess of their carrying value. The fair value of
the Texas and General Partner reporting units approximates their carrying values after considering the impairment loss
above and, as of June 30, 2016, $230 million and $1.1 billion of goodwill remains allocated to the reporting units,
respectively.
Our impairment determinations involved significant assumptions and judgments, as discussed above. Differing assumptions
regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations. If actual future results are not
consistent with these assumptions and estimates, or the assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may
be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges, which would be recognized in the period in which we would
determine that the carrying value exceeds fair value. We would expect that a prolonged or sustained period of lower
commodity prices would adversely affect the estimate of future operating results, which could result in future goodwill
impairments for other reporting units due to the potential impact on the cash flows of our operations.
The goodwill impairment has no effect on liquidity or capital resources. However, it adversely affects net earnings in the
period recognized.
Income Taxes
The amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial
and foreign tax jurisdictions. We recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period
and the applicable statutory tax rates. We routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and
establish accruals for such amounts. We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences,
operating losses and other tax carryforwards. We routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a
valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets that largely
resulted from the full cost impairments recognized during 2015. As a result of the continued financial losses in the second
quarter of 2016, we continued to have a 100% valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2016.
The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are often based on assumptions that are subject to a significant amount of
judgment by management. These assumptions and judgments are reviewed and adjusted as facts and circumstances
change. Material changes to our income tax accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing audits,
changes in legislation or resolution of other pending matters.
Non-GAAP Measures
We make reference to “core earnings (loss) attributable to Devon” and “core earnings (loss) per share attributable to Devon”
in “Overview of 2016 Results” in this Item 2. that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-
GAAP measures are not alternatives to GAAP measures, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Core earnings (loss) attributable to Devon, as well as the per share amount,
represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their
published estimates of our financial results. Our non-GAAP measures are typically used as a quarterly performance
measure. Amounts excluded for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 relate to derivatives and financial instrument
fair value changes, noncash asset impairments (including an impairment of goodwill), deferred tax asset valuation allowance
and restructuring and transaction costs. Amounts excluded for the second quarter and first six months of 2015 relate to
derivatives and financial instrument fair value changes and noncash asset impairments. We believe these non-GAAP
measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. We also believe
these non-GAAP measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our
peers.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Commodity Price Risk
As of June 30, 2016, we have commodity derivatives that pertain to a portion of our production for the last six months of 2016,
as well as 2017. The key terms to our open oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments are presented in Note 3 in “Part
I. Financial Information – Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report.
The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At
June 30, 2016, a 10% change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have
changed our net asset positions by the following amounts:

At June 30, 2016, we had total debt of $12.7 billion. Of this amount, $11.6 billion bears fixed interest rates averaging 5.4%,
and approximately $1.1 billion is comprised of floating rate debt with interest rates averaging 1.9%.
As of June 30, 2016, we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in Note 3 in “Part I. Financial Information –
Item 1. Financial Statements” in this report. The fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of
the forward curves of the 3-month LIBOR rate. A 10% change in these forward curves would not have materially impacted
our balance sheet at June 30, 2016.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such
amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries are
translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues, expenses and
cash flow are translated using an average exchange rate during the reporting period. A 10% unfavorable change in the
Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not have materially impacted our June 30, 2016 balance sheet.
Our non-Canadian foreign subsidiaries have a U.S. dollar functional currency. However, some of our subsidiaries hold
Canadian-dollar cash and engage in intercompany loans with Canadian subsidiaries that are based in Canadian dollars.
The value of the Canadian-dollar cash and intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the cash
and loans into the U.S. dollar functional currency.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Devon, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior
management and the Board of Directors.
Based on their evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as
of June 30, 2016 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC rules and forms.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. Other Information
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
We are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. However, to our knowledge as of the date of this
report, there were no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is subject.
Devon Gas Services, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is currently in negotiations with the Environmental
Protection Agency with respect to alleged noncompliance with the leak detection and repair requirements of Environmental
Protection Agency regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act at its Beaver Creek Gas Plant located near Riverton,
Wyoming. Although management cannot predict the outcome of settlement negotiations, the resolution of this matter may
result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
There have been no material changes to the information included in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Under the Devon Plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of our common stock through an investment in the Devon
Stock Fund, which is administered by an independent trustee. Eligible employees purchased approximately 16,400 shares
of our common stock in the second quarter of 2016, at then-prevailing stock prices, that they held through their ownership in
the Stock Fund. We acquired the shares of our common stock sold under the Devon Plan through open-market purchases.
Similarly, eligible Canadian employees may purchase shares of our common stock through an investment in the Canadian
Plan, which is administered by an independent trustee, Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. Shares sold under the
Canadian Plan were acquired through open-market purchases. These shares and any interest in the Canadian Plan were
offered and sold in reliance on the exemptions for offers and sales of securities made outside of the U.S., including under
Regulation S for offers and sales of securities to employees pursuant to an employee benefit plan established and
administered in accordance with the law of a country other than the U.S. In the second quarter of 2016, there were no shares
purchased by Canadian employees.
