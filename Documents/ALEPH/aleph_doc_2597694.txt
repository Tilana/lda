Chairman’s review
6
In another year of volatility for our industry, 
Senex proved itself a sustainable business  
with the credentials to deliver future growth.
Global markets continued to falter throughout my second 
year as Senex Chairman. The Brent crude oil price index 
reached a 12 year low of under US$27/bbl in January 2016. 
Global demand for hydrocarbons continued to grow, albeit 
slower than in recent years. Oversupply in both global oil 
and LNG markets became a dominant market factor, with 
rebalancing at least in sight by year end for oil, if not quite 
yet for global gas. Religious and political tensions in parts 
of the world rose and spilled over into conflict. And leaders 
of some of the world’s largest economies reached their first 
ever agreements on future goals for carbon emissions and 
a reduction in the rate of global temperature increases.
It is an interesting time to be an oil and gas company.
The unique times in which we are investing create both challenges 
and opportunities. I am pleased to say Senex was able to 
successfully navigate the financial and operational challenges 
arising from the uncertainty, and I feel it has come out stronger and 
ready for the opportunities ahead of  it.
Senex has ended FY16 in a strong financial position, with 
$102 million in the bank. This result was achieved despite the 
impact of  capital deferrals into the company’s lowest production 
result in three years and against the backdrop of  lower prices 
received for its product. This is no small feat, and is the result of  
solid business management and a clear commitment to the long 
game. I am certain that few businesses outside of  the oil and gas 
sector could demonstrate the same resilience in the face of  an 80% 
reduction in their selling price.
Senex continued to hold safety paramount in its operations despite 
the volatility, and it is pleasing to report that safety performance 
improved over the period with a 71% reduction in TRIFR. As a 
Board, we remain committed to ensuring the safety of  our people is 
always the primary focus.
The FY16 year for Senex’s operating business was about 
preserving cash during this period of  uncertainty to deliver growth 
in the future. A robust and well-timed hedging strategy protected 
revenue for one million barrels of  oil sales delivered during FY16, 
guaranteeing an average Brent crude oil floor price of  A$72 per 
barrel for the second half  FY16. Alongside this, a number of  
difficult decisions were taken through the year to deliver a leaner 
organisation with more efficient work flows. This showed clear 
evidence of  the company’s ability to adapt quickly to the changes 
in its marketplace.
Robust capital management and allocation to strategically suitable 
opportunities remains a key focus for the Board as a key driver of  
future returns. A continued reduced and self-funded Cooper Basin 
capital program focused on production and exploitation of  existing 
assets remained sensible in the lower oil price environment. Senex 
invested time in redesigning its exploration and project work flows 
to ensure it retains its focus on the right projects at the right time. 
The Senex portfolio remains in good shape providing optionality for 
continued growth.
The East Australian gas market continued to shape up as an 
exciting opportunity for gas producers during the year. We remain 
firm believers in a strong outlook for gas prices on the East 
Coast, and are actively progressing towards establishing material 
gas production through our gas projects in both the Surat and  
Cooper Basins. We will continue to build capability in these areas, 
and remain alert for new opportunities in this exciting part of  
our industry.
The ramp up of  the Western Surat Gas Project gained pace 
during FY16, with the company making material progress towards 
delivering its first gas into the East Coast gas market – an 
excellent growth opportunity for the company. The transformational 
agreements reached with Santos GLNG in September 2015 
provide the framework for Senex to accelerate the appraisal and 
development of  its acreage. This step also brings Senex closer to 
meeting its goal of  becoming a material gas producer.
I took great delight in visiting the Surat Basin this year with the rest 
of  the Board and the Executive Committee. It gave me a sense of  
anticipation to see the local community and landscape first hand, 
whilst also teaching me much about the divergent landscapes 
Senex has to operate in between the Cooper and Surat Basins. We 
had the opportunity to meet with our neighbours and commercial 
partners, Santos GLNG, while in the area and tour the extensive 
existing infrastructure. It was rewarding to see industry working 
collaboratively and sharing learnings. 
The Senex strategy relies on the successful discovery and 
exploitation of  oil and gas reserves as the foundation for the growth 
of  a material and sustainable energy business. The Board remains 
confident in this strategy, and in the company’s ability to deliver 
on it. We believe that Senex continues to be headed in the right 
direction for growth in the future and for delivering long term value 
to shareholders. 
I was pleased with the appointment of  Dr John Warburton to 
the Board during the period, aimed at further strengthening our 
subsurface skills in our core business to deliver on our growth 
strategy. His capability in the geosciences realm across both 
conventional and unconventional petroleum plays enhances the 
Board’s ability to strategically, commercially and technically assess 
our growth opportunities. 
I would like to acknowledge my fellow Directors for the role they 
play in supporting Senex to achieve its goals throughout the year. 
And, to all Senex staff  who played a part in the continued success 
of  the company – thank you for your continuing commitment, 
energy and drive. 
A sincere thank you to our Managing Director, Ian Davies, for 
his continued passion and positivity in leading the company 
forward through a difficult year. Along with an extremely capable 
management team I have no doubt the coming year will be one of  
progress and growth for Senex.

Managing  
Director’s report

The year has been one of change, yet as I look back it 
is very clear that our strategy, assets and people have 
continued to perform even when surrounded by the 
stresses of uncertainty. We have managed to not only 
sustain our business and position it for healthy growth in 
the future, but have also spent valuable time improving 
work flows and realising efficiencies.
Putting our people’s safety first 
I am pleased that our health and safety performance 
remained strong throughout 2016 with a recorded TRIFR of  
1.8, a reduction of  71% from the previous year. In a period 
when operational activity was low, we used the capacity in 
the business to partner with Sentis, leaders in sustainable 
business and cultural improvement, to conduct a Safety Culture 
Research Project across our business. Combined teams from 
Executive Management, Operational Management, Field 
Supervisory and Operational Staff  undertook training in a Zero 
Injury Program which is now being practiced throughout the 
company and further enhancing a strong safety culture.
We are also collaborating more broadly with industry to share 
knowledge and implement safer practices and processes 
across the industry. We are achieving this through our proactive 
and hands on support of  the Safer Together Forum for 
Queensland Natural Gas Exploration & Production Industry. 
As a leader in the industry, I value the time to focus on the 
fundamentals of  what it means to work safely.
Protecting our business through volatility
Despite the continued depressed oil prices we managed 
to close FY16 in a strong financial position with $102 million 
of  cash and $180 million of  total liquidity. We achieved this 
by going back to basics – reducing our capital expenditure 
by 66% to a five year low of  $27.8 million, taking risk out of  
our revenue line with a well-timed hedging program, and 
applying a grass roots focus on bringing down operating and 
corporate costs.
We have delivered a solid 
result in a year of remarkable 
change and volatility.  
We are well-positioned to 
aggressively pursue growth 
in our business.
Managing Director’s report

Sustainability 
We are privileged to operate in some of  Australia’s most 
unique environments, and remain deeply respectful of  
the responsibility this entails. We continue to apply robust 
environmental controls, performance standards and monitoring 
systems across all activities, with a focus on minimising and 
mitigating our impacts.
On the Western Surat Gas Project we undertook baseline 
studies to set the benchmark for assessing potential impacts 
and developing appropriate mitigation strategies. We are 
focused on understanding the environmental values we will 
be working with in the Surat Basin, and ensuring we both 
preserve these for other users of  the land and uphold our 
corporate responsibilities.
Understanding and supporting our 
stakeholders
We continued through the year to build long-standing  
mutually beneficial relationships by working together with  
our stakeholders and supporting the communities in which  
we operate.
Our continued support of  the Medivac 24 helicopter and the 
Royal Flying Doctor Service in the Cooper Basin has provided 
critical life-saving services in remote areas. This service has 
helped with evacuations and retrievals of  oil and gas workers 
and community members alike.
Our joint venture relationships have continued to strengthen 
and develop over the past year as we work together to manage 
the needs of  all parties.
In the Surat Basin we continue to work on building our 
relationships within the community. We established a small 
local presence in the region; worked together with our 
tenement landholders; commenced community consultation 
sessions; rolled out our local content policy to local suppliers 
and formed new relationships with the Maranoa Council and 
local industry groups.
Senex also supports the indigenous communities we work with, 
including the Dieri, the Yandruwandha Yawarrawarrka and the 
Mandandanji peoples in the Cooper and Surat Basins and we 
look forward to strengthening these important relationships as 
we progress our projects.
We also substantially de-risked the future of  our Western Surat 
Gas Project through a series of  transformational agreements 
with neighbouring producer, Santos GLNG. The agreements 
saw us divest the Maisey block for $42 million cash, while at 
the same time securing a flexible Gas Sales Agreement for 
up to 50 TJ/day and access to a valuable technical database 
that enhances our understanding of  the reservoir and geology. 
Bringing the Western Surat Gas Project online is an important 
step in diversifying and growing Senex’s business.
Operating performance 
This year was one of  consolidation for our business in  
response to uncertainties in the markets in which we operate.  
We greatly reduced capital expenditure and focused our 
efforts on creating efficiencies throughout the business in 
readiness for market recovery and the pursuit of  growth.
In the Cooper Basin we focused on maximising cash flow 
from producing fields; progressing field development plans 
for existing fields; and transforming our way of  exploring 
and evaluating high prospectivity areas for our next 
exploration campaign.
Oil production remained our core business for the year 
with solid production from our fields, combined with a focused 
cost out program. The overall decline in production against last 
year’s performance follows natural field decline and a reduced 
work program for the year.
Our exploration activities are a key growth focus. While we 
reduced exploration spend in response to low oil prices, we 
continued to work with the substantial subsurface database 
we have built through previous seismic and drilling activities to 
build a robust prospect inventory to carry forward as oil prices 
recover. During FY16, this included embedding a regional 
focus to play assessment and prospect evaluation.
The unconventional gas joint venture with Origin Energy 
drilled its first two gas wells during the year, with the fracture 
stimulation of  the first well following in Q1 FY17. This was 
an exciting first step in the evaluation of  potentially material 
gas resources in the Allunga and Patchawarra Troughs in the 
Cooper Basin. If  successful, these areas have the potential to 
supply large volumes of  gas into the East Coast market.
The company’s largest growth project, the Western Surat Gas 
Project in the Surat Basin, achieved a major milestone in the 
period. The suite of  commercial agreements reached with 
Santos GLNG saw us secure a trifecta of  critical benefits – 
funding for our initial appraisal and development phase, a 
binding Gas Sales Agreement for up to 50 TJ/day on flexible 
terms, and access to valuable data which is informing our 
subsurface modelling and appraisal planning. The agreements 
provided the foundations for detailed planning of  our initial 
Phase I appraisal works which will commence in the second 
half  of  2016. These are substantial steps towards the 
development of  a transformational project for Senex.
Outlook for the future 
We are in good shape for the future growth of  our business 
and have remained financially resilient in markets which have 
been depressed for an extended period. I believe our strategy 
remains strong and is delivering.
The fundamentals of  our markets also remain strong. Oil 
demand continues to grow globally, and we are well-placed along 
the cost curve to compete.
In the Cooper Basin we will continue the focus on our unit 
operating costs to maintain healthy margins from production. 
We are confident of  the potential for remaining large oil and 
gas resources in the Cooper Basin, and will continue to invest 
in targeted exploration.
Gas demand on the East Coast remains robust and we are 
building our supply position to meet this demand.
Over the next year we will continue to ramp up our efforts to 
appraise and develop the Western Surat Gas Project with the 
first wells to be online by the end of  2016.
First and foremost, we will focus on keeping our people and 
communities in which we operate safe by being responsible 
corporate citizens in our operations. We take pride in our focus 
on two way conversations with our stakeholders, so that long-
term, meaningful relationships can be formed and the value from 
Australia’s resources wealth can be delivered to all.
And, to our Executive team and talented staff, a sincere thank 
you for your continued commitment and dedication in a year 
that has been both challenging and volatile.

Senex strategy
10
Our vision is to be Australia’s leading independent 
oil and gas exploration and production company.
Senex is a growth-focused oil and gas exploration and production company. At the 
foundation of this ambition is an extensive portfolio of high quality exploration and 
production acreage in well-established hydrocarbon provinces and a talented and 
highly motivated team.

The Senex oil business
Exploiting a material position  
in the Cooper Basin
The Senex gas business
Realising the oppportunity of the  
East Coast gas market
In global oil markets, the correction has been both sharp and 
prolonged. While industry has reacted quickly to curtail capital 
spend in the short-term in response, the mid and longer term 
fundamentals remain strong. Oil demand globally continues 
to grow and global supply side continues to flex in response 
to global prices. Large amounts of  capital have already been 
deferred in response to the current price downturn, and Senex 
continues to see great opportunity for those operators who can 
achieve low-cost capability across the full value chain of  oil 
discovery to production as oil prices stabilise in coming  
years. With the Cooper Basin offering the rare combination  
of  a proven petroleum system, extensive infrastructure, and 
large swathes of  underexplored acreage, Senex believes  
its operations are well positioned to deliver low price oil  
into the future.
The Senex oil strategy therefore continues to focus on growth 
through the discovery and delivery of  low cost oil to market, 
supported by its core production operations at already 
discovered fields.
Gas markets globally have also seen a challenging year, with 
the commissioning of  new projects and global trends on 
renewable and coal-fired electricity generation creating an 
oversupply of  LNG. Despite this, Australia’s East Coast gas 
market is experiencing unprecedented demand growth locally 
as a result of  LNG project start-ups in Gladstone continuing 
to create near-term pricing pressure. We believe there are 
excellent supply opportunities for companies able to bring gas 
to market in the coming years. With margins on gas projects 
generally lower than oil, Senex believes the key to competing 
successfully in this market is creating scale and efficiency.
In recent years, Senex has actively pursued this market 
opportunity by building its gas business both through the 
evaluation and exploration of its existing Cooper Basin acreage, 
as well as the acquisition of its Western Surat Gas Project in the 
Surat Basin. Our priorities in gas remain to bring material volumes 
of gas to market at the lowest possible cost. This would see Senex 
achieve a diversified, long term, and steady source of cash flow, 
to complement the higher margin, but more volatile oil business.
Our objectives in oil are:
PRODUCE EFFICIENTLY
Our objectives in gas are:
IN THE SURAT BASIN
Bring material gas reserves to market and diversify the 
company’s revenue stream.
IN THE COOPER BASIN
Prove up material reserves to access the East Coast gas 
market opportunity over the coming years.
Discovered oil is the cash flow engine for future growth. 
Senex is relentlessly focused on driving down costs through 
efficiency and innovation.
DEVELOP THOROUGHLY
Maximising recovery of  discovered fields is the lowest risk 
growth available to Senex. The Company is committed 
to investigating and evaluating all options to maximise oil 
recoveries up.
EXPLORE EFFECTIVELY
Pushing the envelope on exploration success and the 
minimisation of dry holes drives organic growth. Embracing 
new technologies, rigorous desk top evaluation and continued 
learning are at the core of Senex’s exploration methodology.
VENTURE SELECTIVELY
Pursuing inorganic growth only where it can provide low 
life cycle costs and a fit with strategy without compromising 
Senex’s fiscal strength.

Operating performance overview
FY16 was a year of consolidation for Senex as 
it responded to uncertainties in the global and 
domestic markets in which it operates.
The company reduced capital expenditure significantly as volatility increased in 
global oil markets. Senex instead focused valuable energy and resources on creating 
efficiencies in its businesses and setting stronger foundations for recovery and growth. 
This measured approach to a challenging year allowed Senex to materially progress 
strategy delivery while preserving financial strength.

Production
Reserves
Senex produced 1.01 mmboe in FY16, in line with market 
guidance for the financial year. This result reflects a solid 
contribution from the Company’s existing oil fields, which 
performed at or ahead of  expectations for the year. Production 
was down on prior years given the limited number of  new wells 
brought online as a result of  the substantially reduced capital 
programs in FY15 and FY16 in response to the fall in global  
oil prices.
In addition, Senex and the joint venture saw the deferral of  
anticipated production from the Vanessa discovery as a result 
of  pipeline integrity issues downstream of  Vanessa after the 
completion of  Senex’s production facilities.
Reserve increases were realised in both 1P and 2P  
(after adjustment for the sale of  Maisey block sale) as a  
result of  the work programs undertaken in the year.
The reserve movement for the year reflects the realisation  
of  the following factors:
¡
Increased confidence in gas volumes and project 
economics in the Surat Basin
¡ Minor technical revisions across several fields in
the Cooper Basin
Further discussion of  reserve movements is provided in  
the operational sections below.
Drilling activity  
Senex and the joint venture drilled five oil and gas wells in the Cooper Basin during FY16, and brought  
four western flank oil wells on-line. The results of  the program are detailed in the table below.

Financial review
The continued low oil price impacted revenue  
and profit, and was the catalyst for reduced capital 
expenditure. Reduced operating costs and solid 
business management saw us end FY16 in a strong 
financial position despite the volatility in oil markets.

Key differences compared to 2015
Profit on sale of Maisey block
A profit on sale of  $38.2 million on the sale of  the Maisey 
block in the Western Surat Gas Project to Santos GLNG 
was recorded in the first half  of  FY16. This was part of  
the transaction with Santos GLNG for the development of  
the Western Surat Gas Project completed in December 
2015 that also resulted in a 20 year gas sales agreement 
as well as access to significant data on gas wells close to 
Senex tenements.
Impairment
Impairment charges of $69.7 million reflected the decline in global 
oil prices and a reassessment of the value of exploration assets.
Operating costs
Operating costs decreased to $30.6 million as a result of  lower 
volumes and focused cost control, together with lower royalties. 
Oil operating costs (excluding royalties) fell to $28.1 million 
compared to $43.9 million in FY15.
Excluding royalties, oil operating cost per barrel fell to a five year 
low of $28.0 per barrel, compared to $32.5 in FY15. This 
reduction in unit operating cost was achieved through strong 
cost control and some restructuring of operations, and in spite  
of reduced volumes over which fixed costs are recovered.
Oil operating costs per barrel
Oil operating costs (excluding royalties) A$m
Oil UOC (excluding royalties) A$/bbl produced
Exploration expense
Exploration expense of  $2.3 million mainly related to the write 
off  of  the Fulcrum-1 well which was drilled, plugged and 
abandoned in August 2015 after finding the reservoir was 
poorly developed. The large expense in FY15 was a result of  
the expensing of  seven exploration wells as part of  a 13 well 
drilling program.
Sales revenue
Sales revenue decreased by 40% to $69.3 million as a result of  
lower volumes produced and lower realised oil prices.
Sales volumes declined by 27% as a result of  natural field 
decline and minimal drilling to replace existing production in a 
low oil price environment.
Realised oil prices declined by $A17/bbl to $A71/bbl, due to 
the significant decline in Brent oil prices during the FY16 year. 
Senex was protected from the full impact of  the declining oil 
price by the hedging program in place across the full financial 
year. The hedging program delivered settlements (net of  
premiums paid) to Senex of  $13/bbl.
Income tax expense
No income tax expense or benefit was recognised in FY16 due 
to carry forward tax losses and offsets derived largely from our 
ongoing exploration programme. The net deferred tax asset 
position is only recognised to the extent of  future expected tax 
liabilities, resulting in a nil tax expense. An income tax benefit 
of  $10.7 million was recorded in FY15.

COOPER BASIN OIL BUSINESS
Senex’s FY16 program in its Cooper Basin oil business focused on:
 ¡ Maximising cash flow from producing fields through focused cost reduction
 ¡ Progressing field development planning activities to maximise future recovery of oil from discovered fields
 ¡ Regional exploration studies and seismic interpretation to inform the next exploration campaigns.
Production operations
Oil production from the Cooper Basin remained at the core 
of  the Company’s business in FY16, with solid production 
supported by a well-timed hedging program and a focused 
cost reduction program. Oil production of  1.00 million barrels 
was achieved in the year.
The decline in overall production in the current year against 
prior year was in line with natural field declines and a direct 
result of  the reduced capital spend in FY16 and the second 
half  of  FY15. Four new wells were connected in the year, 
including Martlet North-1 and Growler-14 (drilled in FY15) and 
Martlet-2 and Spitfire-7 (drilled in FY16). All wells and fields are 
performing in line with, or better than, expectations.
Production and Capex trends
Production (mmboe)
Capex (A$m)

The Company’s profitability from its oil production activities 
was also maintained during FY16 as a result of  the hedging 
program secured in the latter part of  FY15. This program 
provided Senex with settlements (net of  premium) of  $A13/bbl.
Senex’s focus going forward for its producing oil fields remains 
on maximising production for minimum cost to market.
Appraisal and development, existing fields
Senex continued to evolve its field development planning on 
critical producing fields within the period, resulting in minor 
technical revisions to 1P and 2P reserves.

FY16
Alongside the reduced drilling and connection work program, 
Senex ran a focused and highly successful cost reduction 
program across its operations in the basin. Upstream oil unit 
operating costs (excluding royalties) per barrel of  oil produced 
reduced from A$32/bbl during FY15 to under A$28/bbl during 
FY16, allowing Senex to remain profitable even as oil prices hit 
a 12 year low in the early part of  calendar year 2016.
19
Western flank oil fields
The western flank oil fields account for the majority of  2P 
reserves booked in the Cooper Basin, and maximising recovery 
of  the discovered volumes in these fields remains a core focus 
for the business.
During FY16, Senex extended the limits of  the Martlet and 
Spitfire oil fields in the western flank, as well as completing key 
field tests and further planning to progress secondary recovery 
options on the largest of  the discovered fields in the area.
At the Growler field (Senex 60% and operator), the joint venture 
continued to undertake key activities to evaluate a future water 
flood project which is under evaluation for the first phase of  
secondary recovery at the field. This included the connection 
of  the Growler-14 appraisal well (Drilled in February 2015 
and brought online in August 2015) which extended the 
field and provided further confidence in the reservoir model 
along with a low cost shut-in test of  Growler-6. The shut-in 
of  the well resulted in a reduction in operating costs and an 
overall enhancement of  full field recovery. This test provided 
critical data on the natural aquifer support in the Birkhead 
Reservoir and is currently being incorporated in the full field 
dynamic modelling.
The Snatcher oil field continued to produce above expectations 
for the period, during which time the joint venture completed 
planning activities for the Liberator seismic program. This 
program will be executed in H1 FY17 and will cover the 
unmapped northern extent of  the field. This additional 
information will be critical to determine the most appropriate 
future development activities in the field.
The Spitfire field development planning also materially 
progressed during the period. The Spitfire-7 appraisal well 
(Senex 60% and operator) was drilled in September 2015 and 
encountered 6.6 metres of net pay. The well extended the known 
limits of the Birkhead Reservoir at Spitfire, and was brought 
on-line in October 2015. The joint venture also completed a new 
dynamic model of the Spitfire field and is currently evaluating 
the forward development plan.
The Martlet-2 oil development well (Senex 60% and operator) 
was drilled in November 2015. The well encountered 
4.5 metres of  net pay within the Namur Sandstone and was 
brought on line in January 2016 to accelerate production from 
the field.
During the year, Senex also connected the Martlet North-1 well 
(Senex 60% and operator) which was drilled in January 2015.

Operating review (continued)
20
Southern oil fields
Senex progressed field development planning across its 
southern oil fields during the period, as well as progressing its 
evaluation of  the tight oil potential of  the Murta Formation.
The Murta Formation is a tight structural oil play with 
known accumulations across the Eromanga Basin and is 
considered to have extensive potential in Senex’s 100% held 
southern acreage.
A tight oil pilot exploitation program was undertaken during 
FY16 involving the successful fracture stimulation and flow 
testing of  existing well bores. The tests were designed to 
minimise capital outlay by using existing well bores at Mirage-6 
and Ventura-2. Initial objectives of  the test were to evaluate 
whether fracture stimulation of  the Murta could be successfully 
controlled, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of  stimulation 
techniques in enhancing production from the reservoir.
The program was executed successfully in Q3 FY16, with fluid 
rates increasing and fracture control clearly demonstrated. 
Since execution, the well bores have however been producing 
at a higher water cut than expected. Senex is currently
evaluating the test results and seeking to undertake further 
petrophysical and geological studies to determine the most 
appropriate next steps in the evaluation program.
Exploration
Cooper Basin exploration remains a core focus for future 
growth of  the Senex business. While capital investment in 
exploration was curtailed during FY16 due to the global 
volatility in oil prices, Senex continued to focus on developing 
strong foundations for its next exploration campaign.
Regional geological and geophysical analysis
Senex commenced building a comprehensive regional 
petroleum system model of  the Cooper Basin in FY16 following 
the period of  intense seismic survey data collection and 
drilling in FY14 and FY15. This work leverages the Company’s 
extensive acreage position and is focused on identifying and 
de-risking structural and stratigraphic traps with favourable 
reservoir qualities and commercial reserve potential.
This regional approach will eventually consolidate the

seismic survey data with the substantial database created 
by the long history of  industry activity in the basin. This 
complex, multi-staged approach will be ongoing to 
progressively align geological and risk evaluations.
This investment supports our target to maintain a technically 
robust exploration portfolio of  drillable prospects that are 
assessed consistently and high-graded on a consistent risk 
weighted basis using proven exploration methodolgy and 
leading edge technology.
Drilling activities
The company significantly reduced its exploration drilling 
program in FY16, drilling only one exploration well in the 
western flank.
Fulcrum-1 (Senex 60% and operator) was located 2 kms to 
the southwest of  the Spitfire Field and was drilled in August 
2015. The well encountered hydrocarbon shows within 
the Birkhead Formation. A successful drill stem test was 
completed over a 9 metre interval, however results indicated 
that the reservoir was poorly developed and the well was 
plugged and abandoned.

COOPER BASIN GAS BUSINESS
Senex’s FY16 program in its Cooper Basin gas business focused on 
progressing key projects with the aim of:
 ¡ Establishing gas production as part of the Senex portfolio in the Basin, and
 ¡ Exploring for new material gas resources with sufficient scale to warrant future appraisal and development.
Appraisal and development, existing fields
The Company’s appraisal and development program for FY16 
was focused on the Vanessa and Hornet gas projects.
Vanessa gas project
During FY16, Senex constructed surface facilities at the 
Vanessa gas field (Senex 57% and operator) with the  
objective of  bringing the field to production through the  
SACB JV Moomba infrastructure. The Vanessa field is a small 
conventional gas field originally discovered in the northern 
Cooper Basin in 2007. Senex successfully tested the Vanessa 
ST-1 well under a 50-hour production test during FY15, with 
gas flows achieved at an average rate of  5.0 mmscf/d from the 
Toolachee and Epsilon Formations. The well also produced 
condensate at an average rate of  15 barrels per mmscf/d 
under test.
The joint venture achieved mechanical completion of  the 
surface facilities at Vanessa in Q2 FY16. Subsequent to
this however, integrity issues in the SACB JV infrastructure 
downstream of  Vanessa have led to delays in achieving tie-in 
and commissioning. Senex is continuing to work with the 
infrastructure owners on solutions to the integrity issues, and 
currently expects to bring this gas to market during FY17.
Hornet gas appraisal project
Extended production testing of  the Hornet gas project was 
completed early in FY16, with the Hornet-1 and Kingston 
Rule-1 wells now shut in. Test results were at the lower end of  
expectations, primarily due to higher water saturation levels 
than forecast. With the benefit of  this data, the areal extent 
of  the Patchawarra play has been reduced, and the 2C 
contingent resource booked against these fields decreased. 
Further evaluation of  the complex tight reservoir is ongoing 
and Senex will revisit future appraisal plans in the area 
following the completion of  the regional exploration evaluation 
discussed on page 20 and evaluation of  the broader portfolio 
of  opportunities.
Map: Vanessa gas project
23
Exploration
Cooper Basin gas exploration activities in FY16 focused on 
the commencement of  drilling activities for the unconventional 
gas joint ventures with Origin Energy and Planet Gas. The joint 
ventures are targeting two unconventional gas plays – Permian 
tight gas in the Allunga Trough region of  PEL 637 (Senex 60% 
and operator, Origin 40%) in the southern Cooper Basin, and 
Permian basin-centred gas in the Patchawarra Trough in PEL 638 
(Senex 53.75% and operator, Origin 33.75%, Planet 12.5%) 
in the northern Cooper Basin. No contingent resources are 
currently booked for this project.
The initial work program in both areas is being undertaken as 
part of  a $105 million farm-in program with Origin Energy.
Southern joint venture, PEL 637 (Senex, Origin)
The joint venture completed its evaluation of  the Bauhaus 
3D seismic survey in FY15, and identified an initial two well 
program in the Allunga Trough to evaluate stratigraphic traps in 
the Patchawarra Formation.
Efficient-1 was drilled in October 2015, 1.1 km north-west of  
the Bauhaus-1 gas discovery and 14 km south of  the Big Lake 
gas field. The well reached a total depth of  3,196m. Drilling 
results confirm net pay and gas saturations in line with pre-drill 
estimates, confirming the presence of  a tight Permian gas play 
in the region. The well was cased and suspended ahead of  
fracture stimulation and testing.
Ethereal-1, located approximately 2.5 km north-east of  the 
Bauhaus-1 gas discovery and 3.5 km south-west of  the 
Sasanof-1 well was spudded in December 2015 and reached  
a total depth of  3,234 m in January 2016. The well encountered 
Permian gas in line with prediction and stratigraphically similar 
to Efficient-1. The well was also cased and suspended,  
and a fracture stimulation and testing program commenced  
in July 2016. The Ethereal-1 extended production test is 
planned to run for 90 days, after which the joint venture will 
review, apply learnings and optimise the fracture stimulation 
and testing program to the Efficient-1 well.

Northern joint venture PEL 638 (Senex, 
Origin, Planet)
In the north, the joint venture with Origin Energy and Planet 
Gas completed the interpretation of  the Mudrangie and 
Jonothon seismic surveys identifying several potential drill 
locations targeting both basin-centred and stratigraphic 
gas potential.
Following technical ranking of  potential locations, the joint 
venture reached agreement on the drilling location of  Silver 
Star-1, which will be the first well in the northern farm-in 
program. Silver Star-1 will evaluate basin-centred gas potential 
in the Patchawarra Trough and is expected to be drilled during 
the first half  of  FY17.

SURAT BASIN GAS BUSINESS
Building a material gas business in the Surat Basin is a key component of 
Senex’s corporate strategy, allowing it to geographically diversify its operations 
away from the Cooper Basin and bring a material project to production.
Commercial agreement with Santos GLNG
The company considers the outlook for gas suppliers on the 
East Coast of  Australia to be favourable, and it is proactively 
pursuing this opportunity. The development of  this project is 
underpinned by a twenty year gas sales agreement with the 
partners of  the Santos GLNG Project.
Senex entered into a series of  major agreements with Santos 
GLNG in Q1 FY16 which were transformative for the Western 
Surat Gas Project. The suite of  agreements are outlined in the 
table below, along with the key benefits to Senex.
Senex’s FY16 program in the Surat Basin focused on 
progressing development of  its Western Surat Gas Project, and 
achieved many key strategic milestones.

Appraisal and development
The company’s activities during the year have focused on 
consolidating the benefits of  the Santos GLNG transactions 
with the ongoing planning activities being undertaken in the 
business for initial pilot testing. This work has culminated in 
revised initial development planning and a material upgrade to 
gas reserves, reflecting increased confidence in gas volumes 
and project economics.

The inaugural booking of  1P reserves reflects a high level of  
confidence in the resource and the project. This has been 
gained through the analysis of  production and subsurface data 
from over 250 adjacent Santos GLNG wells in the Roma field, 
together with historical appraisal production and subsurface 
data from 100 wells on the project acreage.
The movement in 2P reserves has also been supported by 
field development planning work undertaken during the year. 
This work indicates that an increased proportion of  previously 
identified volumes in place will be economically producible.  
2C contingent resource has reduced reflecting this conversion 
into 2P reserves.
Senex is progressing its execution planning for initial pilot 
works at Glenora and Eos in parallel to the longer term 
development planning activities. The company expects to 
sanction initial pilot works during early FY17.
The initial appraisal program will involve pilot testing at two 
locations in the south of  the WSGP area, Glenora and Eos. 
The work program will involve the drilling of  production and 
monitoring wells, the completion of  existing wells for production 
in the Glenora block, as well as the construction of  raw gas 
infrastructure and water handling facilities. The company is 
currently working towards the tie-in of  production from the 
Glenora wells to Santos GLNG’s neighbouring facilities under 
the agreements discussed above.
In June, Senex commenced civil works on the project 
acreage, with services provided from several local Roma-
based contractors, in line with the Company’s local content 
policy. Senex is excited by the opportunity presented by the 
WSGP, and is committed to working with local communities 
and landowners to ensure the project provides a positive 
contribution locally.

Effective Risk Management
Senex ERM Framework
At Senex, risk management is an integral part of  everything 
we do, from setting and evaluating successful strategy to 
organising and planning jobs on the ground. The “Senex 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework” enhances 
governance, reliability of  decisions and decision making, 
brand and reputation, communication, and the ability to take 
on new opportunities. Senex’s ERM has been developed in 
accordance with AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009, the Australian and 
international standard for risk management. Given the nature 
of  Senex’s business it is essential that the entire organisational 
shares a common language around risk identification and 
management – this extends from our operations in remote 
areas through to our corporate teams based in Brisbane.
Approach
The Senex ERM incorporates an entity-level view of  risk, an 
understanding of  risk management options and the use of  
consistently developed risk information to support decision 
making and management practices. The Senex ERM helps us 
focus on the most relevant risks to achieving organisational 
goals, from operational and business activities through 
to strategy implementation. The Senex ERM approach is 
designed around key attributes as illustrated in Figure 1:
FIGURE 1: Senex ERM process
Risk Identiﬁcation
& Assessment
Risk Monitoring
& Reporting
Risk Response
During the year, Senex invested time in improving our risk 
management framework based on guidance in the Australian 
standard and the following key principles:
¡ Clear governance and management structure and
documentation
¡ Defined type of  activities to be risk assessed
¡ Defined key roles and responsibilities
¡ Common risk definitions and categories
¡ Common risk assessment tools and techniques
¡ Consistent risk assessment recording
(i.e. risk registers, forms, etc.)
¡ Consistent risk assessment event format
(i.e. meetings, workshops, etc.)
The process of  identifying, assessing and managing  
material business risks is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk and where appropriate accept risk to generate 
returns. The acceptance and management of  enterprise risk is 
included in the company’s strategy process.
Governance
The framework includes clearly defined oversight 
responsibilities for the Board, who are supported by the  
Audit & Risk Committee and the Executive Committee to 
enable effective risk identification, evaluation and management 
across Senex. The key responsibilities throughout Senex are 
outlined in Table 1 below. Figure 2 depicts the ERM Governance 
structure in Senex outlining key roles, responsibilities and 
their subsequent responsibility for maintaining critical ERM 
documentation.

Principal Risks and uncertainties at 30 June 2016
The principal risks and uncertainties in this section have been categorised into strategic risks (commercial, geopolitical,  
market and industrial), financial risks (financial, foreign exchange-interest rate-inflation, credit and liquidity and reputation), 
operational risks (exploration & development, operations, projects, people and health-safety-environment) and compliance risks 
(stakeholder and governance). The principal risks and uncertainties outlined in this section may materialise independently, 
concurrently or in combination and may impede Senex’s ability to meet strategic objectives, either directly or by triggering  
a succession of  events that in aggregate become material to Senex.
EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT RISK
Senex financial condition is 
directly related to our ability 
to acquire, discover and 
develop new resources.
Cause: Exploration and drilling 
activities are inherently risky 
and dependent on access to 
prospective acreage, funding 
and analysis of data. In addition, 
changes in global economic 
conditions may impact economic 
assumptions and commerciality 
of discoveries.
CATEGORY: OPERATIONAL
Impact: Senex’s future financial 
condition is directly related to 
the success of  our exploration 
(and acquisition) efforts and 
our ability to generate future 
reserves and production.
Mitigations: Senex is analysing 
existing acreage for exploration 
drilling prospects by applying 
best-in-class technologies and 
processes to the evaluation 
of  the extensive Cooper Basin 
geoscience database. Senex has a 
range of conventional development 
and enhanced oil recovery projects 
in progress and is actively pursuing 
acquisition targets.
JOINT VENTURES
Senex operates the majority 
of the tenements we hold, 
our growth strategy is 
dependent on technical 
and commercial alignment 
within joint ventures.
Cause: Market conditions 
have impacted the availability 
of  investment capital, which 
then impacts the approach to 
prioritisation of  exploration and 
development opportunities.
CATEGORY: OPERATIONAL/STRATEGIC
Impact: Delayed investment 
approvals may impact Senex 
cash flow and growth strategy.
Mitigations: We encourage 
and promote ongoing and open 
dialogue with our joint ventures, 
including appropriate planning of  
activities.
GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION
CATEGORY: OPERATIONAL/STRATEGIC
At present, all of Senex’s 
revenue is derived from oil 
and gas production in the 
Cooper Basin.
Cause: Oil and gas  
operational activities currently 
focused on Cooper Basin, 
leaving Senex exposed to 
downsides associated with 
weather conditions and 
infrastructure failure.
Impact: Issues in the Cooper 
Basin could impact revenue 
flows or result in cost overruns.
Mitigations: We are actively 
investigating alternate routes to 
market and new ventures outside 
of  the Cooper Basin. We also 
ensure that appropriate insurance 
is in place to mitigate the impact of  
business interruption. In addition 
we are developing a major gas 
project in the Surat Basin.
SAFETY AND HEALTH
High levels of safety 
management are required 
to minimise the risk of harm 
to employees, contractors 
and communities near our 
operations, particularly in 
remote locations.
CATEGORY: HSE/OPERATIONAL
Cause: Oil and gas operational 
activities are inherently 
hazardous, such as drilling and 
driving in remote areas.
Impact: In addition to injury or 
damage to health, impacts may 
include reputational damage 
and fines.
Mitigations: Health and safety 
are a very high priority for 
Senex. We have developed 
detailed management plans, 
including detailed communication 
protocols. We also continue to 
fund a night-vision equipped 
helicopter and support the  
Royal Flying Doctor Service  
in the Cooper Basin for 
emergency response.
HYDROCARBON SPILLS AND LEAKS
CATEGORY: HSE/OPERATIONAL/FINANCIAL
High levels of 
environmental management 
are required to minimise 
the risk of harm to habitat, 
employees, contractors 
and communities near our 
operations from a loss of 
containment of oil or gas.
Cause: Oil and gas operational 
activities involve the storage 
and transport of  the produced 
oil and gas as well as waste 
materials.
Impact: In addition to 
environmental damage, impacts 
may include safety issues, 
reputational damage and fines.
Mitigations: Environmental 
management is a very high 
priority for Senex. We have 
developed detailed standard 
procedures to monitor and limit 
the impact of  our operations on 
the environment.
31
REGULATORY CHANGE
Changes to regulatory 
or fiscal regimes may 
significantly impact Senex 
financially and operationally.
Cause: Governments are 
under increasing pressure from 
activist groups and the general 
public to more restrictively 
regulate certain aspects of  the 
oil and gas industry.
CATEGORY: STRATEGIC
Impact: Approvals for Senex 
projects may be delayed or 
denied, or costs associated with 
the projects may impact their 
economic viability.
Mitigations: We actively 
monitor regulatory and 
political developments on a 
continuous basis and seek to 
engage constructively in public 
discussions where appropriate.
COMMODITY PRICES
The price obtained by Senex 
from oil and gas production 
is subject to both USD price 
volatility and AUD/USD 
exchange rate volatility.
Cause: Commodity prices and 
exchange rates are determined 
by global supply and demand 
and the state of  the global 
economic environment.
CATEGORY: STRATEGIC
Impact: Price and exchange 
rate volatility impacts Senex’s 
revenue, cash flows and asset 
values. Sustained periods of  
low oil price may impact the 
viability of  growth projects.
Mitigations: We actively review 
capital expenditure programs  
and hedging programs to 
mitigate commodity and 
exchange rate volatility.
ACCESS TO INFRASTRUCTURE
CATEGORY: OPERATIONAL
Facilities for storing, 
transporting and processing 
Senex’s oil and gas are 
critical to continued delivery  
to market.
Cause: Our operations are in 
remote locations and we often 
rely on third parties to process 
and transport our oil and gas  
to market.
Impact: Senex’s sustainability 
and growth may be impacted by 
the failure to obtain appropriate 
supporting facilities. Our ability to 
deliver oil and gas to purchasers 
may be delayed or face 
increased costs.
Mitigations: We seek to  
work closely with suppliers of  
infrastructure to mitigate the risk 
of  delays or failure. We continue 
to explore alternative routes  
to market to diversify risk  
where possible.
ACCESS TO FUNDING
Senex’s ability to fund 
operations and future 
growth.
Cause: Volatility or uncertainty 
in capital markets could  
restrict willingness of  debt  
and equity investors to  
provide additional capital.
CATEGORY: STRATEGIC/FINANCIAL
Impact: Senex’s growth 
aspirations require the 
investment of  significant capital 
to generate returns. Our ability 
to explore for and develop oil 
and gas reserves is dependent 
on our ability to generate and 
otherwise access capital to  
fund these activities.
Mitigations: We have 
internal prudent expenditure 
management and forecasting 
with a Board approved budget 
to maximise cash available from 
operations. Senex prioritises 
balance sheet strength to ensure 
the ability to access suitable 
funding. Senex actively seeks 
partnering opportunities to assist 
in funding key activities on a 
project-by-project basis.

People remain at the 
heart of Senex’s success
Resilience in the face of uncertainty
Senex responded to continued depressed market conditions 
across the oil and gas industry, delivering against our plan to 
size and shape the company to be resilient in the face of  oil 
and gas sector volatility and uncertainty. This entailed reducing 
capital and operating expenditure and workforce numbers.
At the end of  the year the Senex Team comprised 146 people 
(FY15:185).
People remain at the heart of  Senex’s success. Achieving a 
collaborative, cohesive and values-led culture is a key objective 
to building a high performance culture. With this in mind we 
undertook the following people-focused activities.
Rewarding and recognising our people
We continued our reward and recognition program for 
outstanding and values-led performance using a combination 
of  On-the-Spot Recognition Awards along with Living The 
Values Awards. The aim of  our reward and recognition 
program is to acknowledge and promote quality work that adds 
value to Senex and assists us to motivate and strengthen our 
productivity and culture.
Learning and development
In 2016, we reduced spending on formal education programs 
in step with our cost reduction initiatives to meet market 
challenges. Our learning and development focus moved 
towards in-house learning using on the job experience, 
relationship-based learning, mentoring and presentations.
We continued to offer external learning and development 
through conference attendance, study assistance, webinars 
and workshops.

The Senex Board has adopted measurable objectives in relation to gender and other workplace objectives. Progress against these 
objectives for the 2016 financial year is outlined in the table below:
Diversity & Workplace Objective
FY16 Progress
Ensure that in the interview process for each executive 
position there is at least one female on the interview panel
The recruitment process for executive roles has included at 
least one female present during interviews
Consider diversity when reviewing Board succession 
plans with the aim of  improving gender representation 
and diversity
The Board and the Remuneration and Nominations committee 
comply with the Senex Diversity Policy when discussing and 
reviewing Board appointments
Wherever there is a vacancy at Board and senior 
management level, the Company seeks to find a person with 
the most appropriate qualifications and experience to fulfil 
the role given the need to balance a range of  criteria that is 
required for an effective Board and management team
Review remuneration, recruitment and selection 
practices to ensure they are free from gender bias
Vacancies at Board level are recruited through the use 
of  independent recruitment agents. Senior management 
level roles are recruited to specific role specifications with 
consideration to team dynamics
The remuneration process is reviewed annually and the 
recruitment process is reviewed bi-annually, by the Senex 
Human Resources team. The selection of  new employees is 
comprehensively based on qualification, skills and experience 
relevant to the role
Increase the number of graduate and vacation 
employment positions available and ensure that women 
are provided with opportunities to participate
Six university students gained work experience in the 
Operations, Finance and Exploration teams within Senex. Of  the 
work experience students, one was female and five were male
Employees returning to the workplace after extended 
periods of leave have access to the induction program, 
which helps fast track them back into the business.  
(eg. employees on parental leave and long term personal 
carers leave)
One executive and three non-managers accessed 
parental leave
Health & wellbeing 
Our Health and Wellbeing Program continued to provide benefits during the year for our people. Access to these benefits was 
taken up by 63% of  people these included annual skin checks, discounted gym membership, as well as nominal contributions 
towards health and wellbeing activity. Access to the annual influenza vaccination was taken up by 25% of  people. Our people  
and their families are encouraged to participate in sponsored events and charity activities. We also provide lockers, bike racks  
and showers so people are able to ride or run to work as part of  their daily health activities.

Collaborating for a safer industry
Safer Together 
Safer Together is the Queensland Natural Gas Exploration & 
Production Industry Safety Forum. Senex has been a member 
of  Safer Together since March 2015, and over the past year we 
have increased our level of  participation in the forum materially.
This participation has taken the form of  attending and 
contributing to numerous working groups and industry  
safety forums; undertaking paired leadership site visits to field, 
talking and listening to field staff  and their opinions about 
safety and how it can be improved; and drafting materials such 
as fact sheets and posters for use in educating audiences and 
supporting the forum.
Safer Together is a not-for-profit member-led organisation 
of  operating companies and contract partner companies 
committed to creating the leadership and collaboration needed 
to build a strong and consistent safety culture in the ever 
changing natural gas exploration and production industry in 
Queensland. Our CEO and Managing Director Ian Davies is 
an active member of  the Safety Leaders Group and our EGM 
People and HSE Suzanne Hockey is an active member of  the 
Safety Leaders Working Group. The Safety Leaders Working 
Group exists to support leaders to demonstrate effective and 
visible safety leadership and behaviours. The emphasis of  the 
Group is on everyone, at all levels of  an organisation, being a 
Visible Safety Leader.
Senex will continue to be an active member of  this group, 
helping to drive consistent and continuous improvement of  
safety standards through the creation and implementation of  
practical solutions that can be adopted across the industry.
Continued support for vital link to Royal Flying 
Doctor Service 
FY16 saw Senex continue to support the funding and provision 
of  the Cooper Medivac 24 helicopter based at Moomba in the 
Cooper Basin, South Australia. The helicopter, which is the 
first night-vision equipped helicopter to operate in the area, 
is a vital link to saving time and lives by delivering critically-
ill patients to the Royal Flying Doctor Service at the nearest 
available airstrip so they can then transport the patient to the 
nearest hospital.
Over the year, the helicopter has been called out to community 
call-outs on nine occasions including patient transfers and 
search and rescue tasks. Having this service, which is also 
accompanied by a permanent paramedic, provides a high 
degree of assurance for the health and safety of Senex workers, 
industry, visitors and the communities of remote South Australia.
Moving towards improved health and safety 
In 2017, we will continue to focus on and improve our health 
and safety culture, leadership and systems. We will do this 
by providing strong visible health and safety leadership; 
promoting ownership of  health and safety; monitoring 
indicators of  a positive health and safety culture and reviewing 
the current H&S Management system to ensure it is relevant 
and flexible enough to meet continuing operations.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
2016 key highlights
Recorded a 71% reduction in TRIFR to 1.8
Partnered with Sentis to deliver a Safety Culture and Zero 
Injury Program to Executive Management, Operational 
Management, Field Supervisory and Operational staff
Actively participated in the collaborative industry group 
Safer Together
2016 Health and Safety Performance
We demonstrated strong performance in health and safety 
throughout 2016. Despite decreased operational activity owing 
to the market downturn, and a difficult environment due to staff  
and structural changes we continued putting safety first for all 
our people, activities and assets.
There were no work-related fatalities or recordable injuries 
with the potential for fatality. We had one Lost Time Injury (LTI) 
over the year resulting in a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) of  1.8 for FY16, slightly above that of  FY15 at 1.04. 
Given the 42% decrease in total exposure hours to 559,435 for 
the year overall from 961,151 for FY15, this is a considerable 
improvement statistically.
With the reduced operational activity levels in the Cooper, 
and a heightened emphasis on health and safety, audits were 
prioritised to key target risk areas and assets. The past year 
saw us complete 70 detailed health and safety audits.
Improved safety culture and performance 
Sentis Zero Injury Program (ZIP)
In FY16, Senex partnered with Sentis, leaders in sustainable 
business and cultural improvement, to conduct a Safety Culture 
Research Project across our business.
The project involved site visits and safety culture surveys to 
assess staff, field management and executive management 
attitudes and feelings towards safety throughout Senex.  
From this assessment a training program specific to Senex  
was developed based on the Sentis ZIP program. The ZIP 
program is a psychologically based safety training using the 
latest research and techniques from neuroscience to provide 
tools and techniques that impact on a genuine personal 
commitment to safety.

The future of Senex’s operational and project success 
in both the Cooper and Surat Basins depends on 
strong and rigorous environmental performance.
ENVIRONMENT
2016 Key highlights
Developed targeted program of environmental inspections 
based on risk assessment data
Reduced environmental spills by 72%
Appointed dedicated environmental specialist for 
the Western Surat Gas Project and progressed 
baseline studies
Senex continues to apply robust environmental 
controls, performance standards and 
monitoring systems across all activities, 
continuing to minimise and mitigate impacts in 
the areas in which we operate.
All information presented in this section relates to the 
Company’s Cooper Basin operations in South Australia unless 
specifically stated otherwise.
WSGP – a developing project 
Environmental assessment and approvals work is rapidly 
progressing for Senex’s Western Surat Gas Project with 
several environmental surveys completed over FY16. Senex 
has also appointed a dedicated environmental specialist to 
the team during the year to assist with managing the project’s 
environmental requirements.
Senex is evaluating the most appropriate approach to full field 
development and approvals for the project. Considerable 
assessments have been completed in order to evaluate 
baseline environmental values for the project, which have 
included desktop and site validation as well as meetings with 
relevant stakeholders.
Key aspects assessed include:
Land use
Ecology, soils, hydrology, 
surface water, climate, 
transport networks
Social & amenity
Including Cultural Heritage
Subsurface
Groundwater
With a baseline now established for these aspects, it provides 
the basis for assessing the potential scale of  any adverse 
impacts of  further developing the Western Surat Gas Project, 
including the development of  appropriate mitigation strategies.
Compliance
Senex’s Environment Team conducted 27 targeted 
environmental inspections and audits of  priority operational 
areas during FY16 (FY15 104 inspections). With the reduced 
operational activity levels in the Cooper, inspections were 
prioritised to key target areas and assets. The inspections 
were designed to assess compliance against relevant 
legislation, regulations and licence conditions as well as 
ensuring learnings were incorporated into processes for 
future improvements.
The environmental performance of  wells and facilities is 
ranked using indicators of  high, medium and low. There 
were no high ranked non–compliances which maintained our 
strong compliance record (FY15:0). Regulatory authorities 
also conducted inspections of  Senex operations. From the 
inspections in 2016, one environmental improvement notice 
was issued by the South Australia Government, in line with 
the previous period. All improvement items identified have 
been completed.
Senex continued to apply its policy of  internally reporting and 
examining all environmental incidents regardless of  severity as 
a matter of  best practice and continuous improvement. During 
the reporting period, five reportable spills occurred (FY15:18) 
reducing by 72%. Senex has implemented a number of  
additional measures to support the continued downward trend 
of  this figure in the year ahead.
One serious environmental incident occurred during the 
year. This was a spill of  approximately 500L of  waste oil from 
a tanker on grounds within Senex’s operational area. The 
incident was immediately addressed through containment 
and remediation of  the affected soil. An investigation led to 
process improvements to ensure a reduced risk of  these 
incidents occurring.
41
Land Management
Senex actively works to minimise disturbance to the 
environment as a result of  its activities. This is a critical focus 
to ensuring we continue to maintain our license to operate, 
managing environmental risk and making decisions based on 
robust information.
The Company’s experienced team works closely with 
stakeholders to ensure we reduce our environmental footprint 
wherever possible, implement mitigation measures and 
progressively rehabilitate disturbed areas.
Senex achieved its annual South Australian environmental 
offset requirements through contributions to Operation Flinders, 
a charitable organisation that runs a wilderness adventure 
program for young people at risk. Senex’s offset benefit 
contributions were used for the development and management 
of  the organisation’s Yankaninna Station Conservation Zone, 
aiding in the continuation of  the program.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Senex continues to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
annually under National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 
2007 (NGER). The scheme measures energy produced, energy 
consumed and greenhouse gas emissions, and Senex has 
reported under this scheme since 2011. Senex has reported 
to the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) since 2013, measuring 
emissions to air, land and water.
NGER and NPI calculations for the 2015 financial year are 
provided in this annual report, while calculations for the 2016 
reporting period will be completed in late calendar year 2016. 
The majority of  Senex’s air emissions relate to emissions from 
fuel combustion and flaring or venting, which occur at various 
points during well construction and production.
Water Management
Senex has continued to focus on water management during 
the period. The Company has robust requirements in place for 
the management of  water within the production and drilling 
processes. All water used in the drilling of  wells is sourced 
from existing produced water or from approved water bores. 
All produced water is processed through multi–stage, lined 
interceptor ponds before being transferred to approved 
evaporation ponds. The Company also continues to supply 
treated and tested produced water to local graziers aiding 
them to maintain their livestock watering.

Senex works together with our stakeholders to 
build long-lasting mutually beneficial relationships 
by communicating openly and leveraging each 
other’s strengths.
Economic contribution to communities  
and stakeholders
We are committed to ensuring our economic impact on the 
communities in which we operate is benefical to all parties 
and sustainable. Our activities can have a measurable 
impact through our tax and royalty payments, our community 
programmes, our local procurement strategy and the direct 
and indirect employment we generate.
We are an economic contributor to the local, state and 
national jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax and royalty 
payments assist governments in developing, maintaining and 
growing public services for now and far beyond the life of  
our operations.

WSGP – a developing project 
The past year has seen new stakeholder relations formed 
and existing ones expanded to begin planning, negotiations, 
briefings and allocation of  work packages for the Western 
Surat Gas Project. We have begun studies to support our 
environmental approvals process for the Project. Continued 
holistic and transparent engagement with all stakeholders  
is an important component of  commercialising this coal seam 
gas resource.
Indigenous Relations
In South Australia, Native Title agreements are in place with the 
three traditional owner groups associated with Senex permits. 
Representatives of  the Yandruwandha Yawarrawarrka People 
and the Dieri People conducted work area clearances during 
the year to identify and safeguard cultural heritage sites and 
minimise any impact from Senex activities.
In Queensland, representatives of  the Mandandanji People 
conducted a number of  cultural heritage clearances 
throughout the year on Senex operated permits in the Surat 
Basin, north of  Roma for the development of  the Western Surat 
Gas Project.
Landholder and Community Relations
Senex continued to engage with local landholders and 
the communities in which it operates. This included the 
negotiation of  land access and compensation agreements 
with a number of  landholders in the Cooper and Surat Basins. 
These agreements ranged from conduct and compensation 
agreements to water use agreements, and are aimed 
at offering mutually beneficial outcomes for both Senex 
and landholders.
With the commencement of  the Western Surat Gas Project in 
Queensland, Senex initiated discussions with the community 
including directly affected landholders, neighbouring 
community members, Maranoa Regional Council, Commerce 
Roma, local businesses and suppliers. In Roma, a small 
Senex office was established to offer increased local visibility 
and accessibility to company staff  who are able to talk to 
local stakeholders and answer their questions on the ground. 
Stakeholder engagement will continue and expand during 
FY17 in support of  Senex’s activities in the Surat Basin.
43
Senex continued with its local sponsorship and donation 
program during the year. Landholders, local and indigenous 
communities and potential community partners are able to 
apply for sponsorship or donation funding to aid with local 
causes meeting Senex’s assessment criteria. Senex supported 
a number of  local community initiatives during the year within 
the Cooper and Surat Basins, including:
¡
¡
Funding for the Royal Flying Doctor Service,
Funding for the Cooper Medivac 24 night-vision helicopter,
¡ Sponsorship or donations for South Australia and
Queensland community events such as camp drafts and 
local charity events.

Denis led Senex through significant growth and development after 
joining in 2008. His background of more than 25 years in senior

with annual production of over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent 
and a substantial portfolio of oil and gas growth projects.

and gas industry.

spent four years at Maersk Oil 
and just before joining Senex,

GRAHAM YERBURY  
Chief Financial Officer 
BCom, MBus, CA
Responsible for
Graham is responsible for 
corporate finance, investor 
relations, governance, 
procurement, IT, Legal and 
business improvement.
Experience 
Graham has been with Senex 
for about eight months as 
CFO. His career spans over 
37 years including executive 
and senior finance roles with 
ASX-listed and multi-national 
resources and professional 
services companies. Graham 
was CFO at Cardno Limited 
prior to Senex, and previously 
at Macarthur Coal Limited, 
Site Group International and 
coal seam gas producer Arrow 
Energy. Prior to returning to 
Australia in 2008 he spent eight 
years with BP in the United 
Kingdom and United States  
and six years with ARCO  
pre-merger with BP.
As part of this corporate repositioning, Denis engineered the 
establishment of a fresh and innovative management team 
with Ian Davies at the helm. Having assembled a group of 
talented leaders, Denis applied himself tirelessly to the task 
of mentoring and coaching with an understated humility and 
professionalism that was his trademark at Senex. 
The rebranding was only the beginning of the transformation 
that Denis oversaw in his time as Chairman. Shortly after this, 
Denis oversaw the merger of Senex and Stuart Petroleum 
to create a portfolio of quality oil and gas acreage across 
the highly prolific Cooper Basin – the largest independent 
position in this world class hydrocarbon basin outside of the 
longstanding and tightly held South Australian Cooper Basin 
Joint Venture assets. This portfolio remains at the heart of the 
Senex story today. 
Denis’ leadership saw the company proactively execute two 
successful capital raisings which ultimately underpinned the 
financial strength the business still enjoys today. This focus 
on financial strength has also seen the business respond 
rapidly to emerging opportunities in the sector, securing the
unconventional gas joint venture with Origin Energy, and the 
complex and company-changing asset swap with QGC that 
was the inception of the Western Surat Gas Project.
After stepping down as Chairman, Denis continued his 
dedication to and stewardship of Senex as a non-executive 
director providing ongoing support during the transition to 
Trevor Bourne as incoming Chairman. The successful and 
seamless transition to the next generation of board members 
under Trevor’s leadership has been a tribute to Denis’ 
professionalism and humility. Senex became a fundamentally 
different company under Denis’ steerage. On a personal level, 
his unwavering commitment and support to the Senex team 
at all levels, and in particular to the Managing Director and 
CEO Ian Davies, has been both professionally remarkable and 
keenly appreciated. 
It is with deep respect and gratitude that we farewell Denis 
from the Board of Senex, and on behalf of shareholders, his 
fellow directors and the Senex team wish him every enjoyment 
in his retirement.

and ensuring the Company’s operations deliver against 
stakeholder expectations. To this end, Senex complies 
with all eight Principles in the ASX Corporate Governance 
Council’s Principles and Recommendations (3rd Edition) (ASX 
Guidelines).
Our Corporate Governance Statement highlights the 
Company’s approach to important corporate elements such 
as risk management, internal controls, audit measures, board 
composition and remuneration, board committees, compliance, 
integrity in financial reporting, disclosure, securities trading, 
diversity, and managing conflicts of  interest.
Specific details of  the Company’s corporate governance 
framework and approach to compliance with the ASX 
Guidelines are set out in the FY16 Corporate Governance 
Statement located on the Company’s website at  
http://www.senexenergy.com.au/about/corporate-governance
We believe good 
corporate governance 
is critical to delivering 
shareholder value and 
stakeholder expectations.
Senex Annual Report 2016
Building a culture of  
good governance and 
continuous improvement
Ensuring we meet our governance obligations, 
shareholder value and stakeholder expectations is 
critical to sustainable and ongoing operations for Senex.
Implementing the Senex BMS has resulted in a more 
cohesive and efficient operating framework by providing 
a common and consistent way to work independent 
of where our people are based. This framework is 
supporting us to deliver our corporate strategy. 
The BMS is the key integrator of strategy, process 
and organisation, and was designed to meet our 
requirements for control, efficiency, risk management 
and organisational cohesion. The framework is 
continuously improving to meet our evolving business 
requirements, incorporating lessoned learned and more 
effective ways of operating.
Key benefits of the BMS include:
•   A refined enterprise risk management framework
•  Project delivery methodologies to ensure capital is
allocated and applied prudently
•   Processes for developing and delivering against
strategy, business plans and budgets
•   A clearer and more comprehensive delegation
of authority from the board to the CEO to senior 
management
•   Easy access to important policies that govern the
Company’s operations, and
•   A compliance management framework aligned across
the entire business.
Subject matter experts and functional practitioners from 
across the business have collaborated to identify, map 
and improve processes from the executive level through 
to the functional level. This collaboration is ensuring 
there is a common and repeatable way of delivering 
company practices and processes. In addition we have 
a framework upon which future improvements in the 
management of governance compliance and practices 
can be assessed and implemented. The past year has 
demonstrated our processes and practices in support 
of delivering good governance and organisational 
capability are maturing.
The BMS is an effective support tool to allow the 
Company to execute its strategy within the boundaries 
set by the Board and the CEO. Importantly, it embodies 
and promotes the Company’s vision, mission and values 
that are embedded in everything we do.

prior year.
Auditor independence
A copy of the auditor’s independence declaration as required under s.307C of the Corporations Act is set out on page 82.
Rotation of lead audit partner
Mr Andrew Carrick, a partner of Ernst & Young, is the lead audit partner for his firm’s audit of the Company’s accounts. 
FY16 was the sixth successive financial year in which he was the lead audit partner. As lead audit partner he is, under the 
Corporations Act, “an individual who plays a significant role in the audit”.
The Corporations Act prohibits any individual from playing a significant role in the audit of a listed company for more than five 
successive financial years without approval of the company’s board.
In April 2015, on the recommendation of the Audit & Risk Committee, the Board granted approval pursuant to s.324DAA(1) of  
the Corporations Act for Mr Carrick to play a significant role in the audit of Senex Energy Limited group after FY15. The Board 
considered that:
 ¡
the interests of the Company would be best served by retaining the services of Mr Carrick as lead audit partner, especially 
in view of his experience, his industry knowledge and exposure, and his knowledge of the company’s business;
the extension of Mr Carrick’s term as lead audit partner would maintain the quality of the audit and would not give rise to a 
conflict of interest;
the extension would allow the Board to review the role, responsibilities and membership of the Audit & Risk Committee from 
FY16 onwards before it is required to choose the lead audit partner who will take over from Mr Carrick;
in the event of a change in the membership of the Audit & Risk Committee, the extension would also facilitate an orderly 
handover; and
the existing independence and service metrics in place were sufficient to ensure that auditor independence would not be 
diminished by the extension.

Remuneration philosophy
The performance of Senex depends upon the quality and 
performance of its Non-executive Directors, the CEO, 
Senior Executives and staff. To be successful and maximise 
shareholder wealth, Senex must attract, motivate and retain 
highly skilled individuals.
The Company’s remuneration philosophy is focused on 
promoting long term growth in shareholder returns by:
 ¡
aligning remuneration outcomes with strategic, operational 
and financial goals;
incentivising performance and rewarding performance 
outcomes fairly and reasonably; and 
striking a balance between short term and long term 
growth-related objectives, and providing an incentive for 
superior performance without encouraging irresponsible 
risk taking.
¡
¡
Senex recognises that people are a major asset and that 
remuneration is part of an integrated approach to people 
management. The Company remunerates all people other 
than Non-executive Directors based on performance by 
having a part of their “opportunity to earn” at risk, with this 
being more material for the CEO and Senior Executives. 
Remuneration incentives are considered annually and aligned 
with prevailing market conditions to ensure attraction and 
retention of appropriately skilled employees and executives.
In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the 
structure of Non-executive Director remuneration is separate 
and distinct from the structure of executive remuneration.
Remuneration governance
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee (Committee) 
oversees and formulates recommendations to the Board 
on Senex’s remuneration policies and practices, including 
the remuneration of Non-executive Directors, the CEO and 
Senior Executives. In all of its activities, the Committee aims 
to promote investor understanding and confidence in Senex’s 
remuneration and nomination processes by ensuring formal 
and transparent processes.
The Committee has three primary functions:
 ¡
To support and advise the Board on remuneration and 
remuneration-related matters.
To advise the Board on alignment of the interests of  
employees and shareholders in remuneration matters.
To examine the selection and appointment practices of  
the Board and advise the Board in these matters.
¡
¡
The Committee’s charter can be viewed or downloaded from 
the Senex website.
In recognition of the six successive financial years in which 
he has been the lead audit partner, and in acknowledgement 
of Corporations Act requirements and corporate governance 
expectations, Mr Carrick will not act as lead audit partner for 
Ernst & Young’s audit of the Company’s accounts for FY17. 
The Board has approved the engagement of Mr Anthony 
Jones in place of Mr Carrick as lead audit partner for the 
firm’s audit of the Company’s accounts for FY17.
Indemnification of auditors
To the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to 
indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of the terms 
of its audit engagement agreement, against claims by third 
parties arising from the audit (for an unspecified amount). 
No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young 
during or since the financial year.
Rounding
The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations 
(Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 
2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and  
Investments Commission. Accordingly, amounts have been 
rounded off in accordance with that legislative instrument, 
unless otherwise indicated.

Dr Ralph Craven serves as the Chair of the Committee. 
Mr Trevor Bourne, although not a member of the Committee, 
attends Committee meetings ex officio as Chairman of the 
Board. The CEO attends parts of Committee meetings that do 
not involve discussion of his own arrangements. Other Senior 
Executives may also attend Committee meetings to provide 
management support, as required.
The Board has approved a remuneration policy that provides 
for fixed and performance-based remuneration, and permits 
the offer of a proportion of performance-based remuneration 
to employees in the form of equity.
The Board will continue to assess the remuneration policy and 
practices for the CEO and Senior Executives to ensure they 
are appropriate for the Company in future years. Senex has a 
policy relating to Directors and Senior Executives limiting their 
exposure to risk in equity instruments they hold in or relating to 
the Company.
External advisors and remuneration advice
In performing their roles, the Board and the Committee 
directly commission and receive information, advice and 
recommendations from independent external advisors. 
These assist the Directors to make informed decisions when 
considering Senex’s remuneration policies and practices.
The Board has adopted a protocol for engaging and seeking 
advice from remuneration consultants, which ensures 
remuneration recommendations in relation to KMP are free 
from undue influence by the Executive KMP.
In accordance with the Board approved protocol the 
Committee engaged Guerdon Associates in March 2016 to 
assist with review of Executive KMP remuneration for FY17.

Senex made the following arrangements to ensure that the 
remuneration recommendations would be free from undue 
influence by the member or members of KMP to whom the 
recommendations relate:
 ¡
¡
The Board approved Guerdon as an external remuneration 
consultant under paragraph 206K(2)(a) of the Corporations 
Act to provide remuneration recommendations in relation 
to KMP of the Company.
The terms of appointment of Guerdon included:
 –
That the Board or Committee will from time to 
time commission specific projects related to 
KMP remuneration.
That the remuneration consultant may only provide 
KMP remuneration recommendations to Non-executive 
Directors of Senex.
–
–
That if the remuneration consultant is approached by a 
Senex executive or executives to perform work that will 
not give rise to KMP remuneration recommendations 
then the remuneration consultant should ensure that 
the Board is aware of and accepts that it is reasonable 
for the remuneration consultant to undertake 
that work and will not affect the remuneration 
consultant’s independence.
The Board is satisfied that the remuneration advice was 
provided free from undue influence.
Remuneration of employees other than CEO  
and Senior Executives
The Company seeks to offer remuneration to Senex 
employees, and periodically review their remuneration, in 
accordance with the remuneration philosophy described on 
page 57 of this report.
On 20 July 2016 the Board approved an incentive payment 
to eligible Senex employees (other than the CEO and Senior 
Executives) in recognition of corporate performance in FY16.
The Board determined that the incentive payment was justified 
on the basis of several factors, including the outcomes of  
the FY16 corporate performance scorecard. The corporate 
performance scorecard for Senex employees was substantially 
the same as the FY16 STI corporate performance scorecard 
for the CEO and Senior Executives, which is discussed on 
pages 62 and 63 of this report. The Board noted that:
 ¡
the Company’s achievement in three of the four areas of  
Focus in the scorecard (Licence to Operate, Reserves and 
Financial Performance) had been at or above the Stretch 
hurdle;
even though the Company’s achievement in the other area 
of Focus (Production) had not contributed to the rating, 
the production outcome had been within market guidance;
the results in both Production and Reserves were 
achieved notwithstanding severe cutbacks in capital 
expenditure and reductions in operating expenditure in 
FY16, in both cases below budget;
the results in all areas had been achieved with significantly 
reduced personnel and at significantly lower cost; and
the Company had ended the year in a strong financial 
position with oil price hedging in place, over $100 million 
in cash and access to an $80 million unsecured corporate 
debt facility.
¡
¡
¡
¡
The Board approved the incentive payment to eligible Senex 
employees for FY16 corporate performance in lieu of an offer 
of Performance Rights under the Senex Employee Incentive 
Plan (EIP).
59
An outline of the structure purpose and operation of the EIP was provided in the Company’s 2013, 2014 and 2015 annual 
reports, and the Board approved offers of Performance Rights to Senex employees under the EIP in recognition of corporate 
performance in FY13 and FY14.
The Company will not make an offer under the EIP for FY16, and incentive arrangements for Senex employees (other than the 
CEO and Senior Executives) for FY17 and beyond are under review.
FY16 Executive Remuneration snapshot
Executive KMP receive an annual remuneration package consisting of: 
 ¡
 ¡
 ¡
a total fixed remuneration (TFR), principally base salary and superannuation contributions, that is not at risk; 
an offer of a short term incentive (STI); and
an offer of a long term incentive (LTI).
REMUNERATION STRUCTURE 
FOR EXECUTIVE KMP IN FY16
TFR FOR EXECUTIVE KMP 
IN FY16
STI OFFERED TO EXECUTIVE 
KMP FOR FY16
The Board approved for each Executive KMP (including the CEO) a remuneration 
package for FY16 consisting of:
 ¡
 ¡
an agreed level of TFR; plus 
an STI (FY16 STI) that represented (at STI Grant Date) a maximum uplift of up to 66% 
of the executive’s FY16 TFR (Maximum STI); plus 
an LTI (FY16 LTI) in two tranches that represented (at LTI Grant Date) a maximum 
uplift of up to 50% of the executive’s FY16 TFR (Maximum LTI).
There was no increase in TFR for the CEO in FY16. His TFR remained at the level that 
was first provided to him in FY14. 
There was no increase in full time equivalent (FTE) TFR in FY16 for four of the six 
individuals (other than the CEO) who continued as Executive KMP from FY15. 
The aggregate FTE TFR for FY16 for those six Senior Executives was only 2.2% higher 
than their aggregate FTE TFR for FY15.
Three of the six individuals (other than the CEO) who continued as Executive KMP 
from FY15 ceased to be KMP during FY16. The TFR of the two new hired executives 
who became Executive KMP in FY16 was market determined. 
The aggregate FTE TFR for FY16 for the five individuals (other than the CEO) 
who served as Executive KMP at the end of FY16 was only 2.5% higher than the 
aggregate FTE TFR of the five individuals (other than the CEO) who served in those 
positions at the start of FY16.
The STI offered to the Executive KMP (including the CEO) for FY16 was similar to the 
STI offered to the Executive KMP for FY15. It was an opportunity to receive an STI 
award determined by the Board on the basis of corporate performance for FY16.
The performance condition for the STI was the Board’s determination of the corporate 
performance rating for FY16 based on criteria relevant to corporate performance 
(see page 62 of this report). The Board also considered the extent to which 
the performance, team work and adherence to Senex values by the executives 
contributed to the performance of the Group.
If the Board determined to make an STI award, 50% of the award was to be paid 
in cash after Board approval of the full year financial report for FY16 and the other 
50% was to be provided by the vesting of contingent Performance Rights (FY16 STI 
Rights) subject to 12 month deferral, (i.e. not vesting until 1 July 2017). 
The offer of FY16 STI Rights to the CEO was subject to shareholder approval (granted 
at 2015 AGM).

OUTCOME OF FY16 STI
LTI OFFERED TO EXECUTIVE 
KMP FOR FY16
LTI PROGRAM CHANGES  
FROM PREVIOUS YEAR
¡
The Board determined that the corporate performance rating for FY16 was 75%  
(see page 63 of this report).
¡ On that basis the Board awarded STI for FY16 to the Executive KMP averaging
70.6% of their maximum STI, representing an average 46.6% uplift of their FY16 
Participating TFR.
¡
¡ Of the FY16 STI Rights granted to the Executive KMP, 29.4% lapsed on 20 July 2016 
(the date of the Board’s determination) and the remaining 70.6% will vest if they are 
Senex employees on the vesting date, 1 July 2017.
The LTI offered to the Executive KMP (including the CEO) for FY16 was different in 
terms, level and structure from the LTI offered to the Executive KMP for FY15 and 
previous years. 
The FY16 LTI was provided in the form of two tranches of share appreciation rights 
under the Senex SARs Plan (FY16 LTI SARs) subject to three year performance and 
three year vesting.
¡
¡ Each tranche is subject to a performance condition and a vesting condition over a 
three year performance period, and will only vest if and to the extent that the Board 
determines that the LTI performance condition for that tranche (LTI Performance 
Condition) is satisfied at the end of the three year performance period for that tranche 
and the executive is a Senex group employee on the vesting date for that tranche.
¡ SARs representing 70% of FY16 LTI (Tranche 1 SARs) are subject to an LTI
Performance Condition (Relative TSR Performance Condition) that the Company 
achieves total shareholder return (TSR) at or above the 50th percentile of the TSR of  
a comparator group of companies (S&P/ASX 300 Energy Index) over the three year 
performance period.
¡ SARs representing 30% of FY16 LTI (Tranche 2 SARs) are subject to an LTI
Performance Condition (2P Reserves Target Performance Condition) that the 
Company achieve a stated target number of 2P oil and gas reserves  
(100 – 125 mmboe) over the three year performance period. 
The offers of FY16 LTI SARs, including the offer to the CEO, were approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
For FY13, FY14 and FY15, the Board granted LTI Rights that were subject to a 
performance condition and a vesting condition over a three year performance period.
FY13 LTI Rights, FY14 LTI Rights and FY15 LTI Rights only vest if and to the extent 
that the Board determines that the LTI performance condition is satisfied at the end 
of the respective three year performance period and the executive is a Senex group 
employee at the end of the performance period (the LTI vesting date).
The performance condition for FY13 LTI Rights, FY14 LTI Rights and FY15 LTI Rights 
was absolute TSR over the three year period in each case, with achievement of a 
stretch target of 20% per annum compound growth required for 100% vesting.
¡
¡
¡
¡
¡ All FY13 LTI Rights lapsed on 1 July 2015 when the Board determined that the three
year absolute TSR performance condition was not satisfied.
¡ All FY14 LTI Rights lapsed on 20 July 2016 when the Board determined that the three
¡
year absolute TSR performance condition was not satisfied. 
The three year absolute TSR performance period for FY15 LTI Rights ends on  
30 June 2017.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
¡ No LTI Rights granted in FY13, FY14 or FY15 vested in FY16.
 ¡
Fees paid to Non-executive Directors did not increase in FY16.

Remuneration framework
Framework for Executive KMP remuneration
The table below shows the key objectives of Senex’s remuneration policy for Executive KMP and how these are implemented 
through the Company’s remuneration framework.
ATTRACT AND RETAIN 
TALENTED AND QUALIFIED 
EXECUTIVE KMP
ENCOURAGE EXECUTIVE KMP 
TO STRIVE FOR SUPERIOR 
PERFORMANCE
ALIGN EXECUTIVE KMP AND 
SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS
¡ Remuneration levels are market-aligned against similar roles within industry peer
companies and other listed companies of comparable size and complexity.
¡ A significant component of remuneration is ‘at risk’ under short term and long term 
incentive plans. Value to the executive is dependent on meeting challenging targets.
¡ Consistently high-performing executives are also rewarded through higher base
remuneration.
¡ Short term incentives are aligned to key performance milestones including safety,
¡
¡
¡
profitability and growth.
Long term incentives are delivered through equity instruments linked to 
ordinary shares.
Long term incentives are subject to a three year performance condition and a three 
year vesting condition.
Long term incentives are ‘at risk’ and executives cannot hedge equity instruments 
that are unvested or subject to restrictions.
Vesting on change of control
The Senex Performance Rights Plan and the Senex SARs Plan respectively provide that in the event of change of control of  
the Company:
 ¡ All unvested Performance Rights and all unvested SARs that are subject only to a service condition will vest immediately on
change of control.
¡ All unvested Performance Rights and all unvested SARs that are subject to a performance condition will be tested for 
satisfaction of the performance condition on two alternative bases, and to the extent that the performance condition is 
satisfied under those tests part or all of those unvested Performance Rights and unvested SARs will vest immediately on 
change of control.
¡ All vested SARs (including those that vest on Change of Control) will be deemed to have been exercised at the time the
¡
Change of Control occurs 
The Board has an overriding discretion to vest or increase vesting of unvested Performance Rights and unvested SARs in the 
event of change of control.
Clawback 
Each offer of STI or LTI to Executive KMP has included a term that, in the event that any measure of the Company’s performance 
against an STI or LTI performance condition is subsequently discovered to have been misstated, the Board will have a right at its 
discretion to clawback, out of any unvested entitlements (including unvested Performance Rights and SARs) and any vested but 
unexercised entitlements (including vested Performance Rights and SARs) that the executive holds at that time or subsequently, 
the amount or value of any incentive remuneration (e.g. the number of Performance Rights or SARs, if any) that vested 
incorrectly in reliance on the misstated level of performance.
Employment agreements and termination entitlements
The employment agreement that the Company has entered into with each member of Executive KMP has no fixed term of  
employment. The termination provisions applicable to the Executive KMP are shown below.

Link between performance and remuneration for CEO and Senior Executives
Short term incentive (STI)
At the commencement of each performance year, the Board determines the corporate performance scorecard for the year, 
including the metrics by which short term (12 month) corporate performance will be measured and the level of achievement 
required to achieve “Threshold”, “Target” and “Stretch” performance under each metric. At the end of the year the Board 
determines the corporate performance rating for the year on the basis of the level of achievement under those metrics, and 
awards STI to the CEO and Senior Executives for that year on the basis of that determination. The Board also takes into account 
other factors that are material to the exercise of their discretion.
The short term performance metrics and hurdles in the corporate performance scorecard were chosen to encourage outcomes 
and behaviours that support the safe operation and delivery of the base business while pursuing long-term growth in 
shareholder value. Table 2 presents the corporate performance metrics and Target level hurdles for FY16 and the rationale for 
their selection to determine the corporate performance rating.
For each metric the Board also determined:
¡
¡
a Stretch level hurdle that was perceived to represent the upper limit of possible outcomes that were planned for and a very 
challenging goal that was unlikely to be achieved. The Stretch hurdle was generally aligned with outstanding performance 
and the reward associated with it was 150% of the reward for achievement of the Target hurdle;
a Threshold level hurdle that was perceived to be the minimum level of performance deserving of reward. The Threshold 
hurdle was generally set just below the challenging but achievable Target hurdle and the reward associated with it was 50% 
of the reward for achievement of the Target hurdle.

FY16 STI Performance
The Board conducted performance evaluation of the CEO in 
FY16, and the CEO (in consultation with the human resources 
team and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee) 
conducted performance evaluations of each Senior Executive. 
The performance evaluation of each Senior Executive involved 
obtaining feedback from employees in the executive’s 
business unit and the executive’s peers as well as an 
assessment of the individual executive’s performance against 
agreed measures, an examination of their effectiveness in 
their role, identification of areas of potential improvement 
and assessment as to whether expectations of the CEO, 
shareholders and other stakeholders had been met by 
the individual.
The Board noted the following outcomes in the FY16 STI 
corporate performance scorecard:
 ¡
the achievement in three of the four areas of Focus in the 
scorecard (Licence to Operate, Reserves and Financial 
Performance) had been at or above the Stretch hurdle;
even though the achievement in the other area of Focus 
(Production) had not contributed to the rating, it had been 
within market guidance;
the results in both Production and Reserves were 
achieved notwithstanding severe cutbacks in capital 
expenditure and reductions in operating expenditure in 
FY16, in both cases below budget;
the results in all areas had been achieved with 
significantly reduced personnel and at significantly lower 
cost; and
the Company had ended the year in a strong financial 
position with oil price hedging in place, over $100 million 
in cash and access to an $80 million unsecured corporate 
debt facility.
¡
¡
¡
¡
On that basis the Board determined that the corporate 
performance rating for FY16 was 75%.
After adjustments for individual performance, the Board 
awarded STI for FY16 to the CEO and Senior Executives 
averaging 70.6% of their maximum STI (representing an 
average 46.6% uplift of their FY16 Participating TFR).
Of the FY16 STI Rights granted to the CEO and Senior 
Executives, 29.4% lapsed on 20 July 2016, the date of the 
Board’s determination and the remaining 70.6% will vest if  
they are Senex employees on the vesting date, 1 July 2017.
The offer of FY16 STI Rights to the CEO was subject to 
shareholder approval (granted at 2015 AGM).
63
Long term incentive (LTI)
FY16 LTI
The LTI offered to the CEO and Senior Executives for FY16 
was different in terms, level and structure from the LTI offered 
to the Executive KMP for FY15 and previous years.
The FY16 LTI was provided in the form of two tranches of  
share appreciation rights (SARs) under the Senex SARs Plan 
(FY16 LTI SARs) subject to three year performance and three 
year vesting.
Each tranche is subject to a performance condition and a 
vesting condition over a three year performance period, and 
will only vest if and to the extent that the Board determines 
that the LTI performance condition for that tranche (LTI 
Performance Condition) is satisfied at the end of the three 
year performance period for that tranche and the executive is 
a Senex group employee on the vesting date for that tranche.
SARs representing 70% of FY16 LTI (Tranche 1 SARs) are 
subject to an LTI Performance Condition (Relative TSR 
Performance Condition) that the Company achieves total 
shareholder return (TSR) at or above the 50th percentile of  
the TSR of a comparator group of companies (S&P/ASX 300 
Energy Index) over the three year performance period.
SARs representing 30% of FY16 LTI (Tranche 2 SARs) are 
subject to an LTI Performance Condition (2P Reserves Target 
Performance Condition) that the Company achieve a stated 
target number of 2P oil and gas reserves (100 – 125 mmboe) 
over the three year performance period.
Relative TSR was chosen as the metric for Tranche 1 SARs 
(representing 70% of FY16 LTI) because it provides a 
benchmark of performance against Senex’s peers in the 
market. The S&P/ASX 300 Energy Index was chosen based on 
consideration of a number of factors including the number of  
constituents, its median volatility rank, its size and the fact that 
the group operates in largely the same industry and is faced 
with the same operational and economic risks as Senex.
A 2P oil and gas reserves target of 100 – 125 mmboe was 
chosen as the metric for Tranche 2 SARs (representing 30% 
of FY16 LTI) to reflect median market expectations for Senex’s 
asset portfolio at the end of the three year performance 
period, including having regard to the current level of  
reserves, future budgets and drilling programs and likelihood 
of success in those programs recognising what is already 
known about the properties held and their prospectivity.
The potential remuneration uplift that the FY16 LTI offered to 
the CEO and Senior Executives represented at grant date up 
to 50% of each executive’s FY16 TFR (their maximum LTI).
The number of FY16 LTI SARs granted to the CEO and each 
Senior Executive was calculated by dividing the executive’s 
maximum LTI by the participation price for FY16 LTI SARs.
64
The participation price for FY16 LTI SARs was $0.061 for Tranche 1 and $0.072 for Tranche 2, being the Company’s 
determination of the value of each FY16 LTI SAR granted 9 September 2015, taking into account the LTI Performance Conditions, 
the vesting condition, the starting price, the exercise period, the prices at which Senex shares trade on ASX and the risk and 
volatility of the ASX market in Senex shares, rounded to three decimal places of the currency unit (the dollar).
The offers of FY16 LTI SARs, including the offer to the CEO, were approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.

FY13, FY14 and FY15 LTI
For FY13, FY14 and FY15, the Board granted LTI Rights that were subject to a performance condition and a vesting condition 
over a three year performance period.
The performance condition for FY13 LTI Rights, FY14 LTI Rights and FY15 LTI Rights respectively was absolute TSR over the 
three year period in each case, with achievement of a stretch target of 20% per annum compound growth required for 100% 
vesting. The vesting condition in each case required the executive to be a Senex employee at the end of the performance period.
All FY13 LTI Rights lapsed 1 July 2015 when the Board determined that the three year absolute TSR performance condition was 
not satisfied.
All FY14 LTI Rights lapsed 20 July 2016 when the Board determined that the three year absolute TSR performance condition was 
not satisfied.
The three year absolute TSR performance period for FY15 LTI Rights ends 30 June 2017.
No LTI Rights granted in FY13, FY14 or FY15 vested in FY16.

Performance for the TSR condition will be measured by the increase in value of a Senex share over the LTI Performance Period principally by comparing the 
20 day VWAP of Senex shares traded in the last 20 trading days on ASX up to the end of June 2017 with the 20 day VWAP of Senex shares traded in the last 
20 trading days on ASX up to the end of June 2014. 
 Where TSR achieved is below Threshold level, vesting (if any) of FY 15 LTI Rights for Senior Executives will be at the Senex Board’s discretion, and the Senior 
Executives will have no entitlement.
 Where TSR achieved is between performance levels, vesting is pro rata.
 Where TSR achieved is below Stretch level, vesting (if any) of FY15 LTI Rights for the CEO will be at the Senex Board’s discretion, and the CEO will have 
no entitlement.
Overview of CEO remuneration
The Non-executive Directors directly engaged and received independent external advice on Mr Davies’ remuneration package, 
which was benchmarked against the remuneration paid to CEOs of a group of ASX-listed companies identified as the most 
comparable peers of Senex in the oil and gas sector. This advice was received and considered by the Remuneration and 
Nomination Committee and the Board without management being present.

SHORT TERM INCENTIVES
What was the maximum STI that the

How much STI did the CEO receive for 
FY16 performance?
How is overall performance assessed for 
STI purposes?
The CEO’s TFR was $850,000 in FY16 which has not increased since FY14.
The maximum STI that the CEO could achieve for FY16 represented at grant date 
an uplift of up to 66% of his FY16 TFR, with 50% of any FY16 STI award (if any) to 
be paid in cash after Board approval of the full year financial report for FY 2016, 
and the other 50% provided by the vesting of contingent Performance Rights 
(FY16 STI Rights) subject to 12 month deferral, (i.e. not vesting until 1 July 2017 
and subject to the CEO still being a Senex employee on that date).
The offer of FY16 STI Rights to the CEO was subject to shareholder approval 
(granted at 2015 AGM).
On the basis of its determination of a 75% corporate performance rating for FY16 
the Board awarded an STI to the CEO representing an uplift of 48.375% of his 
FY16 TFR. 
These are discussed on page 62 and table 2.

How much annual LTI was granted to the 
CEO in FY16?
FY16 LTI is described on page 63 of this report.
Senex granted to the CEO:
 ¡
 ¡
4,877,049 Tranche 1 FY16 LTI SARs, and 
1,770,833 Tranche 2 FY16 LTI SARs
as his LTI for FY16. These SARs are the maximum LTI that the CEO can earn for 
FY16, representing at grant date an uplift of 50% of his FY16 TFR. The number of  
FY16 LTI SARs granted was calculated by dividing:
 ¡
70% of the maximum LTI that the Company offered the CEO for FY16 (35% of  
his FY16 TFR) by the participation price for Tranche 1 FY16 LTI SARs, and
30% of the maximum LTI that the Company offered the CEO for FY16 (15% of  
his FY16 TFR) by the participation price for Tranche 2 FY16 LTI SARs.

These are discussed on page 63 of this report.
All FY13 LTI Rights lapsed on 1 July 2015 when the Board determined that the 
three year absolute TSR performance condition was not satisfied.
All FY14 LTI Rights lapsed on 20 July 2016 when the Board determined that the 
three year absolute TSR performance condition was not satisfied.
The three year absolute TSR performance period for FY15 LTI Rights ends on 
30 June 2017.
No LTI Rights granted in FY13, FY14 or FY15 vested in FY16.
Following a review of the CEO’s performance and remuneration in FY16, the 
Board intends to offer him the same TFR for FY17 that he received in FY16, and 
to offer him amounts levels and structures of STI and LTI for FY17 substantially 
similar to the STI and LTI that he was offered for FY16.
The Board expects to review the CEO’s remuneration annually in accordance with 
the key objectives of Senex’s remuneration policy.
At risk remuneration – CEO
In FY16, 53.7% of the maximum potential remuneration offered to the CEO was at risk being subject to performance conditions 
(30.6% for short term performance, 23.1% for long term performance) and vesting conditions (15.3% vesting 1 July 2017, 23.1% 
vesting September 2018).

Overview of Senior Executive remuneration
FIXED REMUNERATION

What was the increase in fixed 
remuneration for Senior Executives 
in FY16?
SHORT TERM INCENTIVES
What was the maximum STI that the 
Senior Executives could achieve in FY16?
How were STI payments calculated?
How was FY16 performance assessed for 
STI purposes?
There was no increase in FTE TFR in FY16 for four of the six individuals (other 
than the CEO) who continued as Executive KMP from FY15.
The aggregate FTE TFR for FY16 for those six Executive KMP was only 2.2% 
higher than their aggregate FTE TFR for FY15.
Three of the six individuals (other than the CEO) who continued as Executive 
KMP from FY15 ceased to be KMP during FY16. The TFR of the two new hired 
executives who became Executive KMP in FY16 was market determined.
The aggregate FTE TFR for FY16 for the five individuals (other than the CEO) 
who served as Executive KMP at the end of FY16 was only 2.5% higher than the 
aggregate FTE TFR of the five individuals (other than the CEO) who served in 
those positions at the start of FY16.
The terms, level and structure of FY16 STI for the Senior Executives were the 
same as for FY16 STI for the CEO (see page 62 of this report). The maximum STI 
that each executive could achieve for FY16 represented at grant date an uplift of  
up to 66% of their FY16 TFR, with 50% of any FY16 STI award (if any) to be paid 
in cash after Board approval of the full year financial report for FY16, and the 
other 50% provided by the vesting of contingent Performance Rights (FY16 STI 
Rights) subject to 12 month deferral, (i.e. not vesting until 1 July 2017 and subject 
to the executive still being a Senex employee on that date).
The STI offered to the Executive KMP (including the CEO) for FY16 was similar  
to the STI offered to the Executive KMP for FY15. It was an opportunity to receive 
an STI award determined by the Board on the basis of corporate performance  
for FY16.
The performance condition for the STI was the Board’s determination of the 
corporate performance rating for FY16 based on criteria relevant to corporate 
performance (see page 62 of this report). The Board also considered the extent 
to which the performance, team work and adherence to Senex values by the 
executives contributed to the performance of the Group.
If the Board determined to make an STI award, 50% of the award was to be paid 
in cash after Board approval of the full year financial report for FY16 and the other 
50% was to be provided by the vesting of contingent Performance Rights (FY16 
STI Rights) subject to 12 month deferral, (i.e. not vesting until 1 July 2017).
The Board determined that the corporate performance rating for FY16 was 75% 
(see page 63 of this report).
On that basis the Board awarded STI for FY16 to the Executive KMP averaging 
70.6% of their maximum STI, representing an average 46.6% uplift of their FY16 
Participating TFR.
Of the FY16 STI Rights granted to the Executive KMP, 29.4% lapsed 20 July 2016, 
the date of the Board’s determination and the remaining 70.6% will vest if they 
are Senex employees on the vesting date, 1 July 2017.
The offer of FY16 STI Rights to the CEO was subject to shareholder approval 
(granted at the 2015 AGM).
The performance measures for STI for the Senior Executives were the same  
as the performance measures for STI for the CEO for FY16 (see page 62  
of this report).
68
SHORT TERM INCENTIVES CONTINUED
What proportion of prior year STI grants 
vested in FY16?
All FY15 STI Rights lapsed 17 August 2015 when the Board determined that there 
would be no award of STI to the CEO or the Senior Executives for FY15.
LONG TERM INCENTIVES
How much annual LTI was granted 
in FY16?
On the basis of the Board’s determination of the corporate performance rating for 
FY14, 66.3% of the FY14 STI Rights held by the FY14 Senior Executives lapsed 
in August 2014. The remaining FY14 STI Rights were due to vest 1 July 2015, 
subject to satisfaction of the vesting condition. 67.7% of the remaining FY14 STI 
Rights vested 1 July 2015, and the others lapsed when the vesting condition was 
not satisfied.
The terms, level and structure of FY16 LTI for the Senior Executives were the same 
as for FY16 LTI for the CEO. The FY16 LTI offered to the Executive KMP (including 
the CEO) was different in terms, level and structure from the LTI offered to the 
Executive KMP for FY15 and previous years (see page 63 to 65 of this report).
The number of FY16 LTI SARs granted to each executive was calculated 
by dividing:
 ¡
70% of the maximum LTI that the Company offered the executive for FY16 
(35% of their FY16 TFR) by the participation price for Tranche 1 FY16 LTI 
SARs, and
30% of the maximum LTI that the Company offered the executive for FY16 
(15% of their FY16 TFR) by the participation price for Tranche 2 FY16 LTI 
SARs.
¡
What proportion of prior year LTI grants 
vested in FY16?
What are the performance conditions for 
the FY16 LTI?
The offers of FY16 LTI SARs, including the offer to the CEO, were approved by 
shareholders at the 2015 AGM. 
For FY13, FY14 and FY15, the Board granted LTI Rights that were subject to a 
performance condition and a vesting condition over a three year performance 
period.
The performance condition for FY13 LTI Rights, FY14 LTI Rights and FY15 LTI 
Rights respectively was absolute TSR over the three year period in each case, 
with achievement of a stretch target of 20% per annum compound growth 
required for 100% vesting. The vesting condition in each case required the 
executive to be a Senex employee at the end of the performance period.
All FY13 LTI Rights lapsed 1 July 2015 when the Board determined that the three 
year absolute TSR performance condition was not satisfied.
All FY14 LTI Rights lapsed 20 July 2016 when the Board determined that the three 
year absolute TSR performance condition was not satisfied.
The three year absolute TSR performance period for FY15 LTI Rights ends  
30 June 2017.
No LTI Rights granted in FY13, FY14 or FY15 vested in FY16.
These are discussed on page 63 of this report.
OUTLOOK
Will the Senior Executives’ remuneration 
increase in FY17?
69
Senex offers levels of fixed and total remuneration for Senior Executives to be 
competitive with industry peers and other listed companies of comparable size 
and complexity. Following a review of the Senior Executives performance and 
remuneration in FY16, the Board intends:
 ¡
to offer some of them an increase in their TFR for FY17 to ensure their 
remuneration level is market-aligned against similar roles within industry peer 
companies and other listed companies of comparable size and complexity; 
and
to offer all of them amounts levels and structures of STI and LTI for FY17 
substantially similar to the STI and LTI that the Company offered to the Senior 
Executives for FY16.
¡
What is the outlook for the Senior 
Executives’ remuneration beyond FY17?
The Board expects to review the Senior Executives’ remuneration annually 
in accordance with the key objectives of Senex’s remuneration policy for the 
remuneration of the Senior Executives.
At risk remuneration – Senior Executives 
In FY16, 53.7% of the maximum potential remuneration offered to each Senior Executive was ‘at risk’ (compared to 58.3% in 
FY15), being subject to performance conditions (30.6% for short term performance, 23.1% for long term performance) and 
vesting conditions (15.3% vesting 1 July 2017, 23.1% vesting September 2018).

Non-executive Director remuneration
The Board seeks to set aggregate remuneration for Non-executive Directors at a level that gives the Company the ability to 
attract and retain directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is reasonable, competitive and acceptable to 
shareholders.
Framework for Non-executive Director remuneration
The table below shows the key objectives of Senex’s remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors and how these are 
implemented through the Company’s remuneration framework.

 ¡
Fee levels do not vary according to Company performance or individual Director 
performance from year to year.
¡ Market capitalisation is considered in setting the aggregate fee pool and in
benchmarking Board and Committee fees.
¡ Senex encourages its Non-executive Directors to build a long term stake in the
Company.
¡ Non-executive Directors can acquire shares through acquisition on market during
trading windows.
70
Maximum aggregate amount of annual remuneration 
The maximum aggregate annual remuneration of Non-executive Directors must not exceed $950,000, being the amount 
determined by Senex shareholders at the 2014 annual general meeting. The Directors agree the amount of remuneration for 
Non-executive Directors each year (which cannot exceed the maximum amount determined by shareholders) and the manner in 
which it is divided between Directors.
Each year, the committee reviews the amount of the maximum aggregate annual remuneration approved by shareholders 
and the manner in which it is apportioned amongst Directors. The Board’s current practice is to apportion a higher fee to the 
Chairman than to the other Non-executive Directors. Each Non-executive Director receives an additional fee for each Board 
committee to which they are appointed, with a higher fee for the chair of each Board committee.

Superannuation and retirement benefits 
In addition to the fees set out above, the Company made superannuation contributions on behalf of Non-executive Directors at 
the statutory rate of superannuation contribution in FY16. Non-executive Directors are not entitled to retirement benefits (other 
than mandatory statutory entitlements).
Realised remuneration 
Table 7 shows the remuneration actually realised in FY16 by the CEO and the Senior Executives who were KMP at 30 June 
2016, and includes any STI received in respect of short term performance measures for FY16, and the value of any LTI from 
prior years that was actually received in FY16. This is additional and different to the disclosures required by the Corporations 
Act and Accounting Standards, particularly in relation to LTI. Total remuneration amounts determined in accordance with the 
requirements of the Corporations Act are set out in Tables 8 and 9 on pages 72 and 74.
As a general principle, the Accounting Standards require a value to be placed on LTI based probabilistic calculations at the time 
of grant. By contrast, this table values the LTI Rights on the basis of the closing price of Senex shares on the date of vesting 
for the quantity of rights that actually vest. In the case of options, a value is attributed only if the options vest and are exercised 
resulting in the issue of shares to the executive, calculated on the basis of the difference between the exercise price and the 
market price of Senex shares on the date of exercise of the options.
The Company believes that the additional information provided in Table 7 is useful to investors as recognised by the Productivity 
Commission in its Report on Executive Remuneration in Australia. The Commission noted that the usefulness of remuneration 
reports to investors was diminished by complexity and omissions and in particular recommended that the report should include 
reporting of pay actually realised by the executives named in the report.

AASB 15
TITLE 
(SUMMARISED) SUMMARY
Revenue from 
Contracts with 
Customers
"AASB 15 establishes principles for reporting useful information to users 
of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with 
customers. AASB 15 supersedes:
(a)  IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
(b)  IAS 18 Revenue.
(c)  IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
(d)   IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate.
(e)  IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers.
(f)   SIC-31 Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services.
The core principle of AASB 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to 
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be 
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognises 
revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the 
following steps:
(a)  Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
(b)   Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
(c)  Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
(d)   Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract.
(e)   Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation.
Early application of this standard is permitted.
The initial application of AASB 15 is not expected to materially affect the 
recognition of revenue in the Groups financial statements. Application 
of the standard is expected to result in changes in the presentation and 
disclosure of information relating to revenue. The Group is currently in the 
process of assessing the impact, if any, of AASB15.

Leases
AASB 16 supersedes:
(a)  AASB 117 Leases;
(b)   Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a
Lease;
(c)  SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives; and
(d)   SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal
Form of a Lease.
AASB 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model and requires:
Lessee accounting
 ¡
Lessees are required to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases 
with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of  
low value.
¡ A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to other non-financial
assets and lease liabilities similarly to other financial liabilities.
¡ Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a
present value basis. The measurement includes non-cancellable lease 
payments (including inflation-linked payments), and also includes 
payments to be made in optional periods if the lessee is reasonably 
certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an 
option to terminate the lease.
¡ AASB 16 contains disclosure requirements for lessees.
Lessor accounting
 ¡ AASB 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting
requirements in AASB 117. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify 
its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for 
those two types of leases differently.
¡ AASB 16 also requires enhanced disclosures to be provided by
lessors that will improve information disclosed about a lessor’s risk 
exposure, particularly to residual value risk.
The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, provided the new revenue 
standard, AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been 
applied, or is applied at the same date as AASB 16.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of AASB 16 on the 
Group's accounting for its operating leases.

AASB 9
TITLE 
(SUMMARISED) SUMMARY
AASB 9 
Financial 
Instruments 
(December 
2014)
AASB 9 Financial Instruments, published in December 2014, which 
replaces AASB 9 Financial Instruments (December 2009), AASB 9 
Financial Instruments (December 2010), existing guidance in AASB 139 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and Interpretation 
9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives. AASB 9 includes revised 
guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, 
including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment 
on financial assets, and new general hedging accounting requirements. 
It also carries forward guidance on recognition and derecognition of  
financial instruments from AASB 139. AASB 9 is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning 1 July 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the application 
of AASB 9. Application of the standard is expected to result in 
changes in the presentation and disclosure of information relating to 
financial instruments.
(d)  Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group as at 30 June each year.
The controlled entities are all those entities over which the Group has power, exposure or rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity, and the ability to use its power over the entity to affect its returns.
The financial statements of the controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using 
consistent accounting policies.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses and profit 
and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated in full.
The controlled entities are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control is accounted for as an 
equity transaction.
(e)   Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity), whose operating 
results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated 
to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available.
Operating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision makers – being the 
executive management team.

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(f)   Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Both the functional and presentation currency of Senex Energy 
Limited and its controlled entities is Australian dollars ($).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in 
the functional currency by applying the exchange rates at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
of exchange at the reporting date and any resulting gain or 
loss is taken to profit or loss.
(g)  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in 
hand and short-term deposits that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
(h)  Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-60 day terms, are 
recognised and carried at the original invoice amount.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Individual debts that are known to be uncollectible are 
written off when identified. An allowance for impairment is 
recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect the receivable.
Inventories
(i) 
Inventories include consumable supplies, maintenance 
spares and materials and parts used in the process of drilling 
wells and the construction of associated surface facilities. 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and 
includes direct costs. Inventories determined to be obsolete or 
damaged are written down to net realisable value.
(j)  Oil inventories
Oil inventories represent the value at balance date of  
hydrocarbons in storage tanks or pipelines. Oil inventories 
are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net 
realisable value is calculated based on the current oil price 
less estimated processing, transport and selling costs.
(k)  Financial instruments
During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group elected 
to early adopt AASB 9 Financial Instruments as issued in 
December 2013 (AASB 2013-9) and the consequential 
amendments in AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian 
Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 (December 
2010) (as amended). AASB 2013-9 replaces the provisions 
of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement that relate to the recognition, classification 
and measurement of financial assets and financial 
liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments and hedge 
accounting. The Group has not early adopted AASB 9 
Financial Instruments as issued in December 2014, including 
the expected-loss impairment model or consequential 
amendments to AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian 
Accounting Standards and AASB 2014-7 Amendments 
to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 
(December 2014).
Non-derivative financial assets
The Group initially recognises financial assets on the date 
at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows from the financial assets have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value. In the 
case of financial assets not subsequently accounted for at fair 
value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the assets are included in the 
initial measurement.
On initial recognition, the Group classifies its financial assets 
as subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair 
value, depending on its business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics 
of the financial assets.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost
A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
using effective interest method and net of any impairment 
loss, if:
 ¡
The asset is held within the business model whose 
objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual 
cash flows; and
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on 
specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of  
principal and interest.
¡
93
(m)   Farm-outs in the exploration and evaluation phase
The Group does not record any expenditure made by the 
farmee on its account. It also does not recognise any gain or 
loss on its exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements, 
but redesignates any costs previously capitalised in relation 
to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained. 
Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is 
credited against costs previously capitalised in relation to 
the whole interest with any excess accounted for as a gain 
on disposal.
(n)
Farm-outs – outside the exploration and 
evaluation phase
In accounting for a farm-out arrangement outside the 
exploration and evaluation phase, the Group:
 ¡ Derecognises the proportion of the asset that it has sold
to the farmee;
¡ Recognises the consideration received or receivable from
the farmee, which represents the cash received and/or 
the farmee’s obligation to fund the capital expenditure in 
relation to the interest retained by the farmor;
¡ Recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset disposed of. A gain is 
recognised only when the value of the consideration can 
be determined reliably. If not, then the Group accounts for 
the consideration received as a reduction in the carrying 
amount of the underlying assets; and
Tests the retained interests for impairment if the terms of  
the arrangement indicate that the retained interest may be 
impaired.
¡
The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of  
property, plant and equipment or an intangible asset is 
recognised initially at its fair value by the Group. However, if  
payment for the item is deferred, the consideration received 
is recognised initially at the cash price equivalent. The 
difference between the nominal amount of the consideration 
and the cash price equivalent is recognised as interest 
revenue. Any part of the consideration that is receivable in the 
form of cash is treated as a definition of a financial asset and 
is accounted for at amortised cost.
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The Group assesses at each reporting period whether there is 
objective evidence that a financial asset (or group of financial 
assets) is impaired. For financial assets carried at amortised 
cost, the amount of loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of  
estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that 
have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s 
original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the 
asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in 
the income statement.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income
The Group may make an irrevocable election on initial 
recognition to present in other comprehensive income 
subsequent changes in the fair value of an investment in an 
equity instrument that is neither held for trading nor contingent 
consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business 
combination to which AASB 3 applies.
Non-derivative liabilities
The Group initially recognises loans and debt securities 
issued on the date when they are originated. Other financial 
liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date. The 
Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual 
obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised a 
fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest in joint operations
(l) 
The Group has interests in joint arrangements that are joint 
operations. A joint operation is a type of joint arrangement 
whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement.
In relation to its interests in joint operations, the Group 
recognises its:
 ¡ Assets, including its share of any assets held jointly.
 ¡
Liabilities, including its share of any liabilities 
incurred jointly.
¡ Revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising
from the joint operation.
¡ Expenses, including its share of any expenses
incurred jointly.
94
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(o)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised 
in profit or loss as incurred unless the costs are eligible 
for capitalisation.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the specific assets as follows:
 ¡ Office equipment, furniture and fittings – over 2 to 5 years;
 ¡
Field-based facilities, plant and equipment – over 5 to 
20 years; and
¡ Motor vehicles – over 5 years.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and amortisation 
methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
reporting date.
Derecognition
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset 
(calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in 
profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
Intangible assets
(p) 
Software
Acquired computer software and licences are capitalised on 
the basis of the cost incurred to acquire and bring into use 
the specific software. These costs are amortised on a straight 
line basis over 2 to 5 years.
(q)  Oil and gas properties
Oil and gas properties are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses 
and include capitalised project expenditure, development 
expenditure and costs associated with lease and 
well equipment.
The Group uses the units of production method to amortise 
costs carried forward in relation to its oil and gas properties. 
For this approach the calculations are based on Proved 
and Probable (2P) reserves as determined by the Group’s 
reserves determination.
Impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties is 
assessed based on Proved and Probable (2P) reserves on a 
cash-generating unit basis.
(r)
Impairment of non-financial assets (excluding 
goodwill and exploration assets)
Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. The Group conducts an internal review 
of asset values at each reporting date, which is used as 
a source of information to assess for any indicators of  
impairment. External factors, such as changes in expected 
future processes, technology and economic conditions, are 
also monitored to assess for indicators of impairment. If any 
indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount is calculated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which 
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. For the purposes of  
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels 
for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets (cash-generating units).
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment 
losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as an expense.
An assessment is also made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable 
amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss 
is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the 
last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable 
amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss. After 
such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future 
periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less 
any residual value, on a straight line basis over its remaining 
useful life.
95
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(s)  Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains 
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and 
requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or 
assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Provisions are measured at the present value of  
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the present obligation at the reporting date using a 
discounted cash flow methodology. If the effect of the time 
value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
Group as a lessee
Rehabilitation costs
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially 
all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the 
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at 
the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are 
apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of  
the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
recognised as an expense in profit or loss.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter 
of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term 
if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain 
ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in 
the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Operating lease incentives are recognised in the Statement of  
Comprehensive Income as part of the total lease expense.
Trade and other payables
(t) 
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised 
cost. Due to their short-term nature, they are not discounted. 
They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to 
the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid 
and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future 
payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and 
services. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid 
within 30 days of recognition.
(u)  Provisions and employee leave benefits
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it 
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the 
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the income statement 
net of any reimbursement.
The Group records the present value of the estimated cost 
of legal and constructive obligations to restore operating 
locations in the period in which the obligation arises. The 
nature of rehabilitation activities includes the removal 
of facilities, abandonment of wells and restoration of  
affected areas.
Typically, the obligation arises when the asset is installed 
at the production location. When the liability is initially 
recorded, the estimated cost is capitalised by increasing the 
carrying amount of the related asset. Over time, the liability 
is increased for the change in the present value based on a 
risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks 
inherent in the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recorded as an accretion charge within finance costs. The 
carrying amount capitalised is amortised over the useful life of  
the related asset.
Costs incurred which relate to an existing condition caused 
by past operations, and which do not have a future economic 
benefit, are expensed. The estimated costs of rehabilitation 
are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate for 
changes in legislation, technology or other circumstances.
Employee leave benefits
Wages, salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary 
benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected 
to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are 
recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the 
reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected 
to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Expenses for non-
accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is 
taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
Long service leave 
The liability for long service is recognised and measured as 
the present value of expected future payments to be made 
in respect of services provided by employees up to the 
reporting date using the projected unit credit method.
(v)  Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
96
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(w)  Share-based payment transactions 
Equity-settled transactions
The Group provides benefits to employees (including key 
management personnel) of the Group in the form of share-
based payments, whereby employees render services 
in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-
settled transactions).
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees 
is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted or with 
reference to the value of the services received. The fair value 
is determined by reference to the current share price in 
relation to fully paid shares and with the use of various pricing 
models in relation to options or rights to acquire shares.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken 
of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to 
the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions), 
if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
in which the performance and/or services conditions are 
fulfilled (the vesting period), ending on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the 
vesting date).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects 
(a) the grant date fair value of the award, (b) the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and (c) the Group’s 
best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will 
ultimately vest. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of  
market performance conditions being met as the effect of  
these conditions is included in the determination of fair value 
at grant date. The income statement charge for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised 
as at the beginning and end of that period.
If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a 
minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not 
been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-
based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee, as measured at the date of modification.
If an equity-settled award is cancelled (other than a grant 
cancelled by forfeiture when the vesting conditions are 
not met), it is treated as if it had vested on the date of  
cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the 
award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award 
is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as 
a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the 
cancelled and the new award are treated as if they were 
a modification of the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect, if any, of the outstanding options and 
performance rights is reflected as additional share dilution in 
the computation of earnings per share.
Cash-settled transactions
The Group recognises the fair value of cash-settled share-
based payment transactions as an employee expense with 
the corresponding liability in employee benefits. The fair 
value of the liability is measured initially, and at the end of  
each reporting period until settled, at the fair value of the 
cash-settled share-based payment transaction, taking into 
consideration the terms and conditions on which the cash-
settled share-based payment transactions were granted, and 
the extent to which the employees have rendered service 
to date.
(x)   Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised and measured at the fair value of  
the consideration received or receivable to the extent it is 
probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group 
and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following 
specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue 
is recognised:
Sale of oil and gas
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of the product have passed to the buyer and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Risks and 
rewards are considered to have passed to the buyer at the 
time of delivery of the product to the customer. For oil sales 
this is generally when crude is delivered by truck or pipeline to 
the Moomba processing facility.
Interest income
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective 
interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised 
cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income 
over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the 
net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Flowline revenue
Flowline revenue represents third party charges for usage of  
flowlines for transport of oil from Lycium to Moomba. Revenue 
is recognised in the period in which it is earned.
(y)  Technical service fees
Technical service fees represent charges for services 
provided to joint operations by Senex employees. These 
recharges are offset against general and administration 
expenditure and are recognised in the period in which they 
are earned.
97
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(z)  Oil and gas exploration costs
Exploration expenditure is expensed as incurred, except 
when such costs are expected to be recouped through the 
successful development and exploitation, or sale, of an area 
of interest. Exploration assets acquired from a third party are 
capitalised, provided that the rights to tenure of the area of  
interest is current and either (a) the carrying value is expected 
to be recouped through the successful development and 
exploitation or sale of an area of interest or (b) exploitation 
and/or evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at 
the reporting date reached a stage that permits a reasonable 
assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically 
recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, 
or relating to, the area of interest are continuing. If capitalised 
exploration assets do not meet either of these tests, they are 
expensed to profit or loss.
Each potential or recognised area of interest is reviewed 
at each reporting date to determine whether economic 
quantities of reserves have been found, or whether further 
exploration and evaluation work is underway or planned to 
support the continued carry forward of capitalised costs.
Where a potential impairment is indicated, an assessment is 
performed for each area of interest to which the exploration 
and evaluation expenditure is attributed. To the extent that 
capitalised expenditure is not expected to be recovered it is 
charged to profit and loss.
Income tax and other taxes
(aa) 
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior 
periods are measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities based on the 
current period’s taxable income. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences 
at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial 
reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, except:
 ¡ When the deferred income tax liability arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and that, at 
the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
¡ When the taxable temporary difference is associated
with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests 
in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax 
credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
 ¡ When the deferred income tax asset relating to the
deductible temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the 
taxable profit or loss; or
¡ When the deductible temporary difference is associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests 
in joint ventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future 
and taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is 
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset 
to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at 
each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it 
has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets 
and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority.
Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT)
PRRT is considered, for accounting purposes, to be a tax 
based on income. Accordingly, current and deferred PRRT 
expense is measured and disclosed on the same basis as 
income tax.
Income tax consolidation legislation
Senex Energy Limited and its controlled entities have 
implemented the tax consolidation legislation.
Senex Energy Limited is responsible for recognising the 
current and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the income 
tax consolidated group.
98
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
As a consequence, individual entities within the consolidated 
group will recognise current and deferred tax amounts 
relating to their own transactions, events and balances. 
Any recognised balances relating to income tax payable or 
receivable, or to tax losses incurred by the individual entity 
will then be transferred to the head entity of the consolidated 
group, Senex Energy Limited, by way of inter-company loan.
The tax consolidated group has entered into a tax sharing 
agreement which sets out the allocation of income tax 
liabilities amongst the entities should the head entity default 
on its tax payment obligations and the treatment of entities 
exiting the tax consolidated group. No amounts have been 
recognised in the financial statements in respect of this tax 
sharing agreement as payment of any amounts under this 
agreement are considered remote.
(ab)   Goods and Services Tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of goods and services tax (GST) except:
 ¡ When the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and
services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of  
acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 
applicable; and
¡ Receivables and payables, which are stated with the
amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, 
the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the Statement of Financial Position.
Cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of  
Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash 
flows arising from investing and financing activities, which 
is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are 
classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of  
the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority.
(ac)
Non-current assets and disposal groups held  
for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held 
for sale and measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount will 
be recovered principally through a sale transaction. They 
are not depreciated or amortised. For an asset or disposal 
group to be classified as held for sale it must be available for 
immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be 
highly probable.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent 
write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value 
less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent 
increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or 
disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative 
impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not 
previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-
current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date 
of derecognition.
(ad)   Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the 
acquisition method of accounting, whereby the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (identifiable net 
assets) are measured on the basis of fair value at the date 
of acquisition.
Where the fair value of consideration paid for a business 
combination exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share of  
the identifiable net assets acquired, the difference is treated 
as purchased goodwill. Where the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost 
of acquisition, the difference is immediately recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income as income.
Goodwill is not amortised, however its carrying amount 
is assessed annually against its recoverable amount. To 
the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the 
recoverable value of the assets, the goodwill is impaired and 
the impairment loss is charged to the profit or loss so as to 
reduce the carrying amount in the Statement of Financial 
Position to its recoverable amount.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously 
acquired business, any remaining balance of associated 
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal or termination.
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value 
or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets.
99
Hedges that meet the strict criteria of hedge accounting are 
accounted for as described below:
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge 
reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the statement of profit and loss as other 
operating expense.
The Group uses Australian dollar and US dollar denominated 
Brent oil puts and collars as hedges of its exposure to foreign 
currency and commodity price risk for forecast oil sales. The 
ineffective portion of the commodity hedge is recognised in 
other operating income or expenses.
Amounts recognised as OCI are transferred to profit or loss 
when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as 
when the forecast oil sales occur.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised without replacement or rollover (as part of the 
hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in OCI remains separately in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs.
Rounding of amounts
(af)  
The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations 
(Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 
2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission.
Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded off  
in accordance with that legislative instrument to the nearest 
thousand dollars, or in certain cases, to the nearest dollar.
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(ae)    Derivative financial instruments and
hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as 
crude oil collars and put options, to hedge its commodity 
price risk. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at 
fair value on each reporting date. Derivatives are carried as 
financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedges and the time value 
of options, which are recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income (OCI) and later reclassified to profit and loss when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss.
Cash flow hedges are those derivatives that hedge the 
Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or 
the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
At the inception of a hedge transaction, the Group formally 
designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it 
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The 
documentation includes identification of the hedging 
instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of  
the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the 
effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair 
value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged 
item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving 
offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are 
assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually 
have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting 
periods for which they were designated.
100
NOTE 3: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise of cash and cash equivalents, cash flow hedges, receivables, payables 
and other financial liabilities.
Risk measurement
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, and financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair 
value. Subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities depends on their classification, summarised in the table below.

Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are measured by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition, and fees or costs associated with the asset or liability. Due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities, 
their carrying value is assumed to approximate their fair value.
AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires disclosures of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy:
Level 1 – the fair value is calculated using quoted market prices in active markets.
Level 2 – the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
Level 3 – the fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The Group does not have any level 1 financial instruments as at 30 June 2016 or 30 June 2015.
*
Level 2 – the fair value of crude oil price contracts has been determined by reference to the Brent ICE forward price (USD) 
and forward exchange rate (AUD:USD) compared to the exercise price of the instrument (AUD) along with the volatility of the 
underlying commodity price and the expiry of the instrument. Gains or losses arising from movements in the fair value of the 
crude oil price contracts are recognised in OCI.
**    Level 3 – The carrying value of the other financial liability owing to Halliburton under the tight oil agreement approximates
fair value at 30 June 2016. Fair value has been determined by reference to the initial amount funded by Halliburton and 
discounted cash flows across the term of the agreement, with reference to expected production from the wells subject to the 
agreement, Brent ICE forward price (USD), forward exchange rate (AUD:USD), forecast operating costs and royalties and 
other commercial terms under the agreement.
Risk exposures and management
The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks through the Audit and Risk Committee and the Group’s risk management 
framework. The primary function of the Committee is to assist the Board to fulfil its responsibility to ensure that the Group’s 
internal control framework is effective and efficient.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk and price risk. The Group uses different 
methods to measure and manage different types of risks to which it is exposed. These include monitoring levels of exposure to 
foreign exchange risk and assessments of market forecasts for foreign exchange, commodity prices and others.
The Committee reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
101
NOTE 3: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Market Risk
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating entity in 
currencies other than the functional currency. The Group’s sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the operating entity making the sale. Funds are converted to Australian dollars on a regular basis.
The Group constantly analyses its transactional currency exposures.
At reporting date, the Group had the following exposure to foreign currency risk from its continuing operations, which are 
disclosed in Australian dollars (AUD):

These movements would not have any impact on other reserves other than retained earnings.
Management believes the reporting date foreign currency risk exposures are representative of the foreign currency risk 
exposure inherent in the financial instruments.
Commodity price risk
The Group’s exposure to commodity price risk relates to the market price of oil and natural gas. The Group entered into a 
series of Australian and US dollar denominated put and zero cost collar instruments covering a total of 1,000,000 barrels of  
oil production for the period 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016. The Group has also entered into a series of oil price hedges for the 
first half of the 2017 financial year covering a total of 400,000 barrels (see note 15 for further details). The Board will continue 
to monitor this risk and seek to mitigate it, if considered necessary. The effect on profit before tax disclosure below takes into 
consideration the Brent oil derivatives in place at 30 June 2016.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the commodity risk exposures in existence at the reporting date.

Liquidity risk
The liquidity position of the Group is managed to ensure sufficient liquid funds are available to meet the Group’s financial 
commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner.
It is the Group’s policy to continually review the Group’s liquidity position, including cash flow forecasts, to determine the forecast 
liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.
The remaining contractual maturities of the Group’s financial liabilities are:
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables – 6 months or less

The Group funds its activities through equity raisings and operating cash flows in order to limit its liquidity risk.
In April 2015, the Group also established an $80 million unsecured three-year debt facility for general corporate purposes.  
The multi-currency facility has a three year term and contains appropriate and non-restrictive covenants. Drawdowns have been 
made for bank guarantees on the debt facility as at 30 June 2016 totalling $2,788,000 (2015: nil) and the establishment fee of  
A$760,000 is being amortised over the term of the facility.
Funding available to the Group from undrawn facilities at 30 June 2016 is $77.2 million (2015: $80 million).
NOTE 4: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to 
assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements and estimates on historical 
experience and on various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the 
basis of the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions, and quantifying the effect of possible future changes is 
not practicable.
Management has identified the following critical accounting policies for which significant judgements, estimates and 
assumptions are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may 
materially affect financial results or the financial position reported in future periods.
Further details of the nature of these assumptions and conditions may be found in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
Recoverability of oil and gas properties and exploration assets
The carrying value of oil and gas properties is tested for impairment annually (as at 30 June) and when circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may be impaired. Exploration assets are assessed at each reporting date to determine if any indicators of  
impairment exist. The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation is set out in note 2(z). The application of this 
policy necessarily requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in 
particular the assessment of whether economic quantities of reserves have been found. Any such estimates and assumptions 
may change as new information becomes available.
103
NOTE 4: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
(CONTINUED)
If, after having capitalised expenditure under the Group’s 
policy, management concludes that the Group is unlikely to 
recover the expenditure by future exploitation or sale, then the 
relevant capitalised amount will be written off to profit or loss.
Oil and gas properties
The Group has determined that the significant decline in 
global oil prices and the deficiency of its market capitalisation 
compared with the carrying amount of its net assets are 
impairment indicators and as such performed impairment 
testing at 31 December 2015 and 30 June 2016.
The Group considers its producing Cooper Basin oil assets 
are a single cash generating unit (“CGU”) and has measured 
the recoverable amount of these assets using a fair value less 
costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) methodology. This methodology 
applies the level 3 of fair value hierarchy. In estimating the 
FVLCD, the Group has estimated the recoverable amount of  
the CGU by measuring the present value of future cash flows 
from the CGU. In estimating the future cash flows assumptions 
are made as to key variables including: economically 
recoverable reserves; future production profiles; commodity 
prices; foreign exchange rates; operating costs and future 
development costs necessary to produce the reserves.
In estimating its forecast cash flows at 31 December 2015, the 
Group adopted Brent oil price assumptions of US$48/bbl in 
2016, US$57/bbl in 2017 and a long term average of US$74/
bbl real and a long term AUD/USD exchange rate of 0.77. 
The recoverable amount is then determined by discounting 
the CGU’s forecast cash flows to their present values using a 
post-tax discount rate of 10.5% (30 June 2015: 10.1%).
In estimating its forecast cash flows for 30 June 2016 the 
Group has adopted Brent oil price assumptions based on 
consensus data of US$49/bbl in 2017, US$60/bbl in 2018 
and a long term average of US$70/bbl and an AUD/USD long 
term exchange rate of 0.72. The recoverable amount is then 
determined by discounting the CGU’s forecast cash flows to 
their present values using a post-tax discount rate of 10.5%.
The Group’s impairment testing of its Cooper Basin oil CGU 
determined no impairment was present at 31 December 
2015 or 30 June 2016, with limited valuation headroom. The 
recoverable amount and the FVLCD is sensitive to:
 ¡
 ¡ Production volumes and timing; and
 ¡ Cost assumptions.
Forecast oil prices and exchange rates;
Exploration assets
Consistent with the decline in global oil price and reduction 
in planned capital expenditure, the Group has assessed 
if impairment indicators exist in respect of its various 
exploration assets.
This analysis concluded that aside from expenditure on the 
gas exploration assets covered by the CBOS farm-in with 
Origin Energy, further expenditure in the near term on the 
Group’s Cooper basin conventional and unconventional gas 
exploration assets is not planned. This being the case, the 
Group has identified individual exploration assets with a nil 
FVLCD and accordingly, the cumulative carrying amount of  
these assets of $69,673,000 is not regarded as recoverable 
and a corresponding impairment charge against the carrying 
value of these assets has been booked.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions 
with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair 
value is determined using various pricing models as detailed 
in Note 32.
Reserves estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of proven and probable 
reserves, that are used to review the carrying value of  
oil and gas properties and amortisation of oil and gas 
properties, include assumptions regarding commodity prices, 
foreign exchange rates, discount rates, and production and 
transportation costs for future cash flows. It also requires 
interpretation of complex geological and geophysical models 
in order to make an assessment of the size, shape, depth 
and quality of reservoirs and their anticipated recoveries. The 
economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate 
reserves may change from period to period. Changes in 
reserves can impact asset carrying values, the provision for 
restoration and the recognition of deferred tax assets, due to 
changes in estimated future cash flows. Reserves are integral 
to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Units of production method of depreciation and 
amortisation
The Group applies the units of production method for 
amortisation of its oil and gas properties and assets based 
on hydrocarbons produced. These calculations require the 
use of estimates and assumptions. Significant judgement 
is required in assessing the available reserves and future 
production associated with the assets to be amortised under 
this method. Factors that must be considered in determining 
reserves and resources and future production are the Group’s 
history of converting resources to reserves in the relevant time 
frames, markets and future developments. When these factors 
change or become known in the future, such differences 
will impact pre-tax profit and carrying values of assets. It is 
impracticable to quantify the effect of these changes in these 
estimates and assumptions in future periods.

NOTE 4: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
(CONTINUED)
Rehabilitation obligations
The Group estimates the future removal costs of oil and gas 
wells and production facilities at the time of installation of the 
assets. In most instances, removal of assets occurs many 
years into the future. This requires judgmental assumptions 
regarding removal data, future environmental legislation, 
the extent of reclamation articles required, the engineering 
methodology for estimating future cost, future removal 
technologies in determining the removal cost, and a ten year 
government bond discount rate to determine the present value 
of these cash flows. For more detail regarding the policy in 
respect of the provision for rehabilitation, refer to note 2(u).
Recovery of deferred tax assets
The Group recognises deferred tax assets when it becomes 
probable that sufficient taxable income will be derived in 
future periods against which to offset these assets. At each 
reporting date, the Group assesses the level of expected 
future cash flows from the business and the probability 
associated with realising these cash flows, and makes an 
assessment of whether the deferred tax assets of the Group 
should be recognised.
Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT)
The PRRT regime applies to all Australian onshore and 
offshore oil and gas projects from 1 July 2012.
Under the regime, it is possible to seek to combine tenements 
and report for PRRT purposes on the combined PRRT taxable 
position. Senex Energy Limited and its controlled entities 
impacted by the PRRT regime have obtained a Combination 
Certificate enabling these entities to combine a number of  
tenements for PRRT purposes. The current and deferred 
PRRT calculations prepared for the purposes of these 
financial statements have been prepared on this basis.
Under the PRRT, Senex Energy Limited and its controlled 
entities impacted by the PRRT regime are eligible for a 
starting base deduction for projects existing at 1 May 2010, 
assuming a valid starting base return is lodged. The due 
date for lodgement of starting base returns for Senex Energy 
Limited and its controlled entities impacted by the PRRT 
regime was 1 June 2014, and these returns were duly lodged. 
Senex Energy Limited and its controlled entities impacted 
by the PRRT regime have included future augmentation 
on expenditure categories, including starting bases, in the 
calculation of future taxable profit when assessing the extent 
to which a deferred tax asset should be recognised in the 
financial statements in relation to PRRT. As a result, no PRRT 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in the financial 
statements for the period ended 30 June 2016. If future 
augmentation had not been included in the forecast of future 
taxable profits, a deferred tax asset of $173,120,000 may 
have been recognised in the financial statements at 30 June 
2016 (2015: $124,185,000).
The key assumptions and estimates for determining 
whether the Group has any future PRRT taxable profits have 
been applied consistently with those in other areas of the 
financial statements.
Acquisition and disposal of tenement interests
The Group accounts for changes in tenement interests on an 
accruals basis when the risks and rewards of ownership have 
substantively passed from the seller to acquirer.
NOTE 5: OPERATING SEGMENTS
Identification of reportable segments
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the 
internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive 
management team (the chief operating decision makers) 
in assessing performance and in determining the allocation 
of resources.
The operating segments identified by management are 
based on the geographical location of the resources which 
correspond to the Group’s strategy. Discrete financial 
information for each of these segments is reported to the 
executive management team on at least a monthly basis.
The reportable segments are based on operating segments 
determined by the geographical location of the resources, 
as these are sources of the Group’s major risks and have the 
most effect on the rates of return.
Geographical segments
Cooper/Eromanga Basins
The Cooper/Eromanga Basins are sedimentary geological 
basins located mainly in the north east part of South Australia 
and extending into south west Queensland.
Surat/Bowen Basins
The Surat/Bowen Basins are geological basins in 
eastern Australia.
Major customers
Revenue is predominantly derived from the sale of crude 
oil to two major customers – IOR Petroleum and the South 
Australian Cooper Basin Joint Venture (SACBJV), a consortium 
of buyers consisting of Santos Limited and its subsidiaries; 
Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd (Beach Energy) and Origin Energy 
Resources Limited.
Accounting policies 
The accounting policies used by the Group in reporting 
segments internally is the same as those used to prepare the 
financial statements in the current and prior period.
Certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not 
allocated to operating segments as they are not considered 
part of the core operations of any segment.
During the year an impairment of $69,673,000 
(2015: $96,963,000) was recognised for the Cooper/
Eromanga Basins.

Tax transparency
The Group currently only operates and has subsidiaries in Australia. During the financial year, the Group paid $5,185,000 of state 
taxes, fringe benefits tax and royalties in Australia (2015: $14,136,000).
Income tax losses
The above reconciliation of accounting profit/ (loss) to income tax expense shows that the Group did not pay income tax during 
the year ended 30 June 2016. At 30 June 2016, the Group had $149,145,000 (2015: $173,570,000) of carry-forward tax losses 
and offsets that are available for use in Australia. The Group therefore has deferred tax assets arising from these tax losses and 
offsets (not all of which have been recognised at 30 June 2016) of $44,744,000 (2015: $52,071,000) that are available for offset 
against future taxable profits of the income tax consolidated group, subject to the relevant tax loss recoupment requirements 
being met.

Unrecognised temporary differences – Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT)
The PRRT legislation provides for Senex Energy Limited and its controlled entities impacted by the PRRT regime to adopt a 
starting base for projects existing at 1 May 2010, which is deductible in determining any future taxable profit. Senex Energy 
Limited and its controlled entities impacted by the PRRT regime have included future augmentation on PRRT expenditure 
categories, including starting bases, in the calculation of future taxable profit when assessing the extent to which a deferred tax 
asset should be recognised in the financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2016. As a result, no deferred tax asset has 
been recognised in the financial statements for PRRT purposes for the period ended 30 June 2016.
The total of unrecognised temporary differences in respect of PRRT for existing projects is $618,286,000 (2015: $443,519,000). 
If future augmentation had not been included in the forecast of future taxable profits, a deferred tax asset of $173,120,000 
(2015: $124,185,000) may have been recognised in the financial statements at 30 June 2016. This is calculated at 28% of these 
unrecognised temporary differences, recognising the deductibility of PRRT for income tax purposes. The PRRT-only impact of  
these unrecognised temporary differences at 40% is $247,314,000 (2015: $177,407,000).
Senex Energy Limited and its controlled entities impacted by the PRRT regime also have a number of exploration permits 
which will not be subject to PRRT until they meet the definition of a production licence for PRRT purposes. Carry forward 
PRRT expenditures exist for these exploration permits which may give rise to a deferred tax asset should assessable receipts 
be generated from the tenement area in the future. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in relation to the temporary 
differences for the exploration permits as its realisation is not regarded as probable at 30 June 2016. The total amount of  
unrecognised temporary differences in relation to PRRT for exploration permits is $964,976,000 (2015: $935,221,000).

Cash flow hedges
Crude oil put and collar instruments measured at fair value through OCI are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow 
hedges of forecast oil sales in US and Australian dollars. These forecast transactions are highly probable and comprise the 
Group’s forecast expected production from existing well stock for the period 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016.
The Group entered into a series of US dollar denominated put instruments covering a total of 400,000 barrels of oil production

The rehabilitation provision is split between a current portion of $18,901,000 (2015: $10,530,000) based on rehabilitation 
expected to occur in the next 12 months and the non-current portion of $46,707,000 (2015: $52,197,000).
119
NOTE 25: NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES – PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)
Nature and timing of provisions
Rehabilitation
A provision for rehabilitation is recognised for costs such as reclamation, waste site closure and other costs associated with 
the restoration of an oil or gas site. Estimates of the restoration obligations are based on anticipated technology and legal 
requirements and future costs. In determining the rehabilitation provision, the Group has assumed no significant changes 
will occur in the relevant Federal and State legislation in relation to restoration of such properties in the future. It is expected 
that rehabilitation costs for assets will be incurred at the end of the assets’ useful lives. The assets’ useful lives are currently 
estimated between four and eighteen years.
Long service leave
Refer to note 2(u) for the relevant accounting policy applied in the measurement of this provision.
Onerous contracts
A provision has been recognised for certain contracts which are regarded as onerous due to the unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contracts exceeding the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract.
The onerous contracts include a rig standby contract under which the Group is required to pay certain standby charges for a 
drill rig. The amount of the charges payable varies depending on thresholds in the agreement and the extent to which the rig is 
used by the Group or third parties. Payments are made under the agreement on a six monthly basis and the final payment is due 
upon expiry of the contract in July 2017.
The onerous contracts also include a portion of the Group’s head office lease space (net of sub-let income) that is surplus to 
the Group’s current requirements. The lease expires on 30 June 2019 and the payments (net of the sub-let income) will vary 
depending on the duration and commercial terms of the sub-lease.
Other provisions
Other provisions include provisions relating to legal disputes, contractors’ claims and lease liability adjustments.

Capital management
When managing capital (being total contributed equity of $451,233,000 at 30 June 2016), management’s objectives are to 
ensure the Group continues as a going concern as well as to maintain optimal returns to shareholders through capital growth.
The Group funds its activities through equity raising, and in April 2015 also established an $80 million unsecured three-year debt 
facility for general corporate purposes. Drawdowns have been made on the debt facility for bank guarantees at 30 June 2016 
totalling $2,788,000 (2015: nil). The financial performance of the business is monitored against an approved annual budget and 
approved work plans to ensure that adequate funding will be available to carry out planned activities.

Exploration and development commitments
Due to the nature of the Group’s operations in exploration and evaluation of areas of interest, it is not possible to forecast the 
nature or amount of future expenditure, although it will be necessary to incur expenditure. In order to maintain its interests in 
present permit areas, the Group must expend by 30 June 2017 approximately $43,055,000 (2015: $38,493,000). Expenditure 
beyond 30 June 2017 is expected to total approximately $115,043,000 (2015: $136,076,000) to maintain the same interests.
Exploration and evaluation commitments disclosed above do not include amounts free carried by other parties under separate 
arrangements. These free carry amount totals approximately $43,580,000 (2015: $59,000,000).
NOTE 31: CONTINGENCIES
Other contingencies
The Group is aware of native title claims made in respect of areas in Queensland in which the Group has an interest and 
recognises that there might be additional claims made in the future. A definitive assessment cannot be made at this time of what 
impact the current or future claims, if any, may have on the Group.
There were no other unrecorded contingent assets or liabilities in place for the Group at 30 June 2016.

NOTE 32: SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share-based payments
Employee share options, performance rights and share appreciation rights
Performance rights, share appreciation rights and options are issued to employees on a case by case basis at the Board’s 
discretion and are assessed annually.
(a)  Options
Options granted carry no dividend or voting rights. All options on issue have vested and are exercisable at any time up to their 
expiry. When exercised, each option is convertible into one ordinary share.
Option holders do not have any right, by virtue of the option, to participate in any share issue of the Company or any related 
body corporate.
The exercise price of options is based on the Board’s assessment of a price which will provide appropriate performance 
incentive to the holder of the options.
No options were granted during the year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: nil).
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at the end of the period was 0.91 years  
(2015: 1.47 years).

Performance rights
The Company has adopted performance rights plans for 
executives and employees, which directly link equity-based 
incentives to performance conditions.
Short term incentive performance rights were granted to 
the CEO and Senior Executives during the year ended 
30 June 2016 (FY16 STI rights) subject to a performance 
condition requiring the Board’s determination of the corporate 
performance rating for FY16 on the basis of safety, oil 
production, reserves growth, operating costs and individual 
performance targets and a vesting condition requiring the 
executive to be a Senex employee on 1 July 2017. Those 
rights were valued with reference to employees’ total fixed 
remuneration, estimated corporate performance percentage 
and average individual performance percentage.
On the basis of the Board’s determination of the corporate 
performance rating for FY16, the Board awarded FY16 STI 
bonuses averaging 70.6% of maximum STI to the CEO and 
Senior Executives, so 29.4% of the FY16 STI Rights held by 
the CEO and Senior Executives lapsed on 20 July 2016, the 
date of the Board’s determination, and the remaining 70.6% 
will vest if they are Senex employees on the vesting date, 
1 July 2017.
On the basis of the Board’s determination of the corporate 
performance rating for FY15, all FY15 STI rights granted on 
similar terms to the CEO and Senior Executives during the 
year ended 30 June 2015 lapsed on 17 August 2015.
Long term incentive performance rights were granted to the 
CEO and Senior Executives during the years ended 30 June 
2013, (FY13 LTI rights), 30 June 2014, (FY14 LTI rights) and 
30 June 2015 (FY15 LTI rights), and each annual grant was 
subject to a performance condition requiring achievement 
of absolute total shareholder return hurdle over a three-
year period, and subject to a vesting condition requiring the 
executive to be a Senex employee at the end of the three year 
period. Those rights were valued using a monte carlo pricing 
model that takes into account grant date, share price at grant 
date, volatility of underlying share, dividend yield, expected 
term and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the right.
All FY 13 LTI rights lapsed on 1 July 2015 and all FY14 LTI 
rights lapsed on 20 July 2016, in each case on the basis of  
the Board’s determination that the absolute total shareholder 
return hurdle for those rights was not achieved. The three year 
performance period for FY15 LTI rights ends on 30 June 2017. 
No FY13 LTI rights, FY14 LTI rights or FY15 LTI rights vested 
in FY16.
Performance rights were granted to employees (other than 
the CEO and Senior Executives) under the EIP for the year 
ended 30 June 2013 (FY13 EIP rights) and the year ended 
30 June 2014 (FY14 EIP rights) in recognition of corporate 
performance in the areas of safety, oil production and 
reserves growth and individual performance in those years. 
50% of each grant vested immediately and the other 50% was 
subject to a vesting condition requiring the employee to be a 
Senex employee on 1 July 2015. When the vesting condition 
was satisfied, remaining FY13 EIP rights and FY14 EIP 
rights vested on 1 July 2015. Those rights were valued with 
reference to employees’ total fixed remuneration, estimated 
corporate performance percentage and average individual 
performance percentage.
On the basis of the Board’s determination of the corporate 
performance rating for FY15, no FY15 EIP performance rights 
were granted to employees under the EIP for the year ended 
30 June 2015. Similarly, no FY16 EIP performance rights will 
be granted. The Board has determined that the company 
will provide shares in FY17 to certain employees (other than 
the CEO and senior executives) in recognition of corporate 
performance for FY16.
If the performance condition applicable to a performance 
right is satisfied, and the performance right vests, the holder 
is entitled to receive, without payment, on the vesting date for 
that performance right, one fully paid ordinary share in the 
Company for each vested performance right.
Performance rights holders do not have any right, by virtue of  
the performance right, to participate in any share issue of the 
Company or any related body corporate.

Share appreciation rights
The Company has adopted a share appreciation rights plan for executives and employees, which directly links equity-based 
incentives to performance conditions.
Long term incentive share appreciation rights were granted to the CEO and Senior Executives during the year ended  
30 June 2016 (FY16 LTI SARs) in two tranches, each subject to a performance condition over a three-year period, and subject  
to a vesting condition requiring the executive to be a Senex employee at the end of the three year period. The expiry date of  
FY17 LTI SARs is seven years after grant date. Any SAR that vests will be exercisable at any time up until expiry date.
SARs representing 70% of FY16 LTI (Tranche 1 SARs) are subject to an LTI Performance Condition (Relative TSR Performance 
Condition) that the Company achieves total shareholder return (TSR) at or above the 50th percentile of the TSR of a comparator 
group of companies (S&P/ASX 300 Energy Index) over the three year performance period.
126
NOTE 32: SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (CONTINUED)
SARs representing 30% of FY16 LTI (Tranche 2 SARs) are subject to an LTI Performance Condition (2P Reserves Target 
Performance Condition) that the Company achieve a stated target number of 2P oil and gas reserves (100 – 125 mmboe) over 
the three year performance period.
Those SARs were valued using a monte carlo pricing model that takes into account grant date, share price at grant date, volatility 
of underlying share, dividend yield, expected term and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the right.
Set out below are summaries of share appreciation rights granted, exercised and lapsed during the period:

During FY16, the Group made payments of $14,886 (FY15: $22,716) to Morgans Financial Limited, a company associated

Corporate Limited, a member company of the Morgans Financial group, as an additional corporate adviser in the Company’s 
strategic review project until 31 December 2016. Under that engagement, the Company agreed to reward Morgan Corporate 
for corporate advisory services on a value basis on the occurrence of certain events, on terms substantially similar to the 
terms on which the Company agreed to remunerate the corporate adviser first engaged for the project. The Company is not 
obliged to pay any retainer or other service fee to Morgan Corporate. None of the services referred to above were provided 
by Mr Crommelin as a director of the Group. There were no other transactions with Key Management Personnel or their related 
parties during the current or prior year, other than those mentioned above.

Independent auditor's report to the members of Senex Energy Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Senex Energy Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity
comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the
financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of
the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note
2(b), the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of
Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity's internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
