<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala 
and the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2010. In compliance with its mandate, the office in Guatemala 
conducted monitoring activities and provided advisory services and technical cooperation 
to State institutions and civil society to assist in the implementation of the 
recommendations contained in previous reports. 
</p>
<p> Through its monitoring activities, OHCHR-Guatemala collected extensive 
information on the human rights situation in the country. The report contains an analysis of 
several key human rights issues, such as security and justice, including the right to life, the 
proliferation and availability of firearms, the tendency to privatize public security, the fight 
against impunity, and deprivation of liberty. The increased vulnerability of human rights 
defenders and women&#8217;s rights are also addressed in the report. It also describes the lack of 
formal recognition of indigenous rights and its discriminatory effects on access to justice, 
political participation and the enjoyment of the right to consultation. An analysis of the 
progress on the enjoyment of the rights to food, education and health and an overview of 
OHCHR-Guatemala activities during 2010, including technical cooperation and advisory

<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) signed an agreement with the Government of Guatemala for the 
establishment of a country office. Under this agreement, the mandate of OHCHR-
Guatemala is to monitor the situation of human rights in order to advise State institutions 
and civil society. The mandate was extended for three years on 19 September 2008.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala, 
focusing on several key issues, such as security and justice. It also describes the work 
conducted by OHCHR-Guatemala in accordance with its mandate, including information 
on the advisory services and technical cooperation provided to assist implementation of the 
recommendations contained in the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous annual reports. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  National context 
</b></p>
<p>3. In spite of recent efforts to address the issues of justice and security, the level of 
impunity and insecurity continues to be of great concern. Mounting insecurity marked 
political debates, with strong calls for repressive measures, while a weak justice system has 
been unable to tackle impunity. 
</p>
<p>4. There were, however, important advances in criminal procedures against a former 
president and various former high-level officials, including ministers, accused of 
corruption, money-laundering and serious human rights crimes. A solid investigation, 
conducted with full respect for due process, sent a message of hope to the population on the 
pre-eminence of the law over all of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>5. Several key ministers resigned or were dismissed, including those responsible for 
the interior, finance, education, agriculture, energy and mining. This lack of continuity, 
particularly in the security and justice institutions, with constant change of high-ranking 
officials, delays in their selection and a lack of internal control and accountability 
mechanisms, among other factors, makes it difficult to sustain and consolidate institutional 
achievements.  
</p>
<p>6. Following the resignation of the Commissioner for the International Commission 
against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Carlos Castresana, the United Nations Secretary-
General appointed Francisco Dall&#8217;Anese, former Attorney General of Costa Rica, to 
succeed him in August. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2010, Guatemala was hit by several natural disasters, which affected over 470,000 
people and caused 96 deaths and major damage to infrastructure and productive capital. 
</p>
<p>8. Different factors, such as the decrease in the State&#8217;s fiscal revenue and the rejection 
of the proposed 2010 national budget by the Congress, left the State underfunded, which 
affected not only the implementation of public policies, but also the general functioning of 
the State and its capacity to fulfil international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Overall human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>9. Fourteen years after their signing, the Peace Agreements have not been effectively 
implemented, despite the clear opportunity they provided to break the persisting patterns of 
social, political and economic exclusion. There is a consistent failure by the State to make </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>adequate use of the opportunities, time and capacity it has to carry out effective measures to 
comply with human rights obligations, including some that require no financial resources.  
</p>
<p>10. Despite the ratification of international human rights treaties and other 
achievements, the implementation of international and regional human rights obligations 
remains a challenge. The steps taken to ensure human rights protection are still insufficient, 
while some remain ineffective or unsustainable. Many of the achievements are frequently 
formalistic, lack impact, depend on specific circumstances and personal efforts and do not 
represent long-term institutional changes. 
</p>
<p>11. Although positive steps were taken by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on the 
prosecution of high-impact cases, high levels of impunity remain a major concern, and the 
justice system has not yet been able to respond to some cases of serious human rights 
violations pursued by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office with the support of CICIG. Examples 
of such cases include those regarding the assassination of three representatives of the 
Central American Parliament (February 2007) and the killings at the Pav&#243;n penal farm 
(September 2006), in which a former Minister of the Interior, a former Chief of the 
National Civilian Police (NCP) and a former director of the penitentiary system were 
allegedly involved in extrajudicial executions. 
</p>
<p>12. Although Guatemala has consistently improved its Human Development Index 
(increasing from 0.408 in 1990 to 0.560 in 2010),1 poverty (54.8 per cent) and extreme 
poverty (29.1 per cent) continue to affect most people.2 The Government increased social 
expenditure, mainly by enhancing conditional cash transfer programmes. With an annual 
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2 per cent, Guatemala should adopt distributive 
measures to improve the living conditions of the poorest, especially indigenous peoples. A 
progressive fiscal reform that enables the State to fulfil its human rights obligations and 
tackle the challenges regarding current low tax levels and the collection and exemption 
regimes is urgent. It is crucial to address inequality gaps through an economic and social 
policy that guarantees universal access to economic, social and cultural rights. The 
Government and Congress should also take measures to ensure that the resources are well-
distributed and spent in due time. 
</p>
<p>13. The development model in Guatemala is based primarily on the extractive industry, 
large energy development projects and large-scale agricultural exports. The State faces the 
challenge of ensuring that development is conducted in a way that respects individual and 
collective rights, particularly those of indigenous peoples, including their rights to a safe 
environment, to consultation and to decide their own priorities for the process of 
development. 
</p>
<p>14. Social conflicts related to the right to land and territory, environmental rights and, in 
general, the right of indigenous peoples to be consulted about decisions affecting them, 
have not yet been dealt with through effective mechanisms. Moreover, these mechanisms 
do not target the root causes of these conflicts and the institutional response fails to assume 
the standards of a multicultural and inclusive State. The declaration of states of emergency 
to address such conflicts, together with the abusive use of the penal system, affects the 
freedoms of assembly and demonstration. 
</p>
<p>15. The absence of legal recognition of community radio stations has led to their 
criminal prosecution, while legislation establishes economic criteria for the distribution of

<p>radio frequencies, therefore affecting equal conditions of access for all sectors of the 
population. Although preliminary steps have been taken in the implementation of the law 
on access to information to ensure the transparency of public institutions, an overall policy 
on State accountability vis-&#224;-vis civil society is pending. 
</p>
<p>16. In pre-electoral periods, there has been a strong tendency by some public and 
political sectors and part of civil society to promote repressive measures, even the death 
penalty, as the only possible option to tackle all forms of violence, especially by youth 
gangs (<i>maras</i>). Besides being fear-inducing, stigmatizing or contrary to human rights 
principles, most of these measures have not proven effective in reducing crime or solving 
the root problems. Furthermore, their implementation would lead to weaker institutions that 
are more vulnerable to illegal groups and more susceptible to the prevalence of individual 
interests and to the repetition of measures that have deepened exclusion and generated 
serious human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>17. Security measures based on human rights standards are the only viable option to 
tackle the current and long-term challenges related to violence. If backed by the political 
will to provide the necessary conditions and resources, such measures would guarantee 
strong institutions with the legitimacy, stability and effectiveness demanded by the 
population, enabling them to address the causes of violence, systematic social and political 
exclusion, and the monocultural understanding of the State. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Security and justice 
</b></p>
<p>18. There were 4,925 violent deaths in 2010, including 564 women and 393 children; 41 
people were murdered by lynching and 6,132 people were injured as a result of violent 
attacks. A total of 2,878 investigations were initiated for crimes against life and 179 
sentences were issued, reflecting a high level of impunity.3 The percentage of deaths by 
firearms continues to be approximately 85 per cent.4 
</p>
<p>19. Although the number of violent deaths decreased in relation to 2009,5 the situation 
remains alarming and requires a comprehensive approach by the State. There are structural 
differences in situations of violence between urban and rural areas, and specific 
characteristics in border regions affected by drug and arms trafficking, trafficking in 
persons and the infiltration of organized crime. Patterns of violence inherited from the past 
have not been overcome. Several forms of severe and recurrent violence, such as femicide, 
homicide of socially marginalized persons (so-called &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;), domestic 
violence, lynching, extortion and kidnapping exist in the country. 
</p>
<p>20. Structural changes in security and justice have not been put forward, neither to 
diminish the causes of crime nor to address the social, cultural and economic risk factors of 
violence. Insecurity and impunity affect daily life and generate mistrust and social 
dissatisfaction. All this is exacerbated by the lack of adequate attention to victims. 
</p>
<p>21. The State lacks a comprehensive and strategic policy to combat crime, consistent 
with human rights principles. The High Commissioner reiterates that the National 
Agreement for the Advancement of Security and Justice, adopted in 2009, constitutes a key 
</p>
<p>  
 3 From January to 8 December 2010, impunity remained at 95 per cent for crimes against life. 
</p>
<p>Regarding all crimes, 3,389 sentences (1.28 per cent) were issued in relation to 265,095 complaints 
filed. Source: Judicial system.

<p>tool to guide strategic action. For it to have any practical value, the implementation must be 
supported by the decisive political will of the institutions. 
</p>
<p>22. On the legislative front, the Law on Private Security Services, the Law on Seizure of 
Assets and the Law on the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Decrees 52-2010, 55-2010 and 40-
2010, respectively) have been adopted. All these laws need to be implemented promptly 
and in compliance with human rights standards, with adequate resources. The adoption of 
key legislation to combat insecurity, organized crime, corruption and impunity, such as the 
amendments to the Law on Arms and Ammunitions, and the amendments to the laws on 
<i>amparo</i> and preliminary hearings is still pending. 
</p>
<p>23. On 5 October, Congress approved a law that would regulate a procedure to enable 
the application of the death penalty. It was subsequently vetoed by the President. The High 
Commissioner welcomes this veto and reiterates her conviction that Guatemala should take 
definite steps towards the abolition of death penalty, as it is one of only two countries in 
Latin America that have not yet done so. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Security 
</b></p>
<p>24. The proliferation and availability of legal and illegal firearms exacerbate the 
phenomenon of armed violence and increase the number of violent deaths. The State should 
promote policies and clear legislation to reduce and control the number of firearms held by 
private corporations and individuals, including, for example, by prioritizing the 
implementation of a national plan for disarmament. The Constitutional Court decision of 25 
May interpreting the scope of the Law on Arms and Ammunitions of 2009 does not 
promote a strict limitation on the number of firearms permitted per person. 
</p>
<p>25. Security functions have continued to be handed over, de facto, either to private 
entities over which there is still no effective control, or to the military, through the 
promotion of neighbourhood patrols and combined police and army patrols. The capacity of 
private security companies is still notoriously larger than that of the NCP. This separates 
the concept of security from the State&#8217;s obligation to protect human rights and turns 
security into a market product accessible only to those sectors with the resources to pay for 
it. The proposal of the Commission that was established to design and carry out the police 
reform, which reflects the recommendations issued by the High Commissioner, is a positive 
step. However, police reform should be agreed upon as a State policy as soon as possible, 
with its own budget, and a political consensus on it should be reached, regardless of the 
results of the electoral process. Moreover, working conditions, including salaries, must be 
improved in particular for members of the police and employees in the penitentiary system. 
</p>
<p>26. The High Commissioner would like to recall that the prevention of violence and 
crime must be an essential element of the design, implementation and evaluation of a 
comprehensive security policy.6 The State has promoted some positive initiatives in this 
regard, including the Unit for the Community Prevention of Violence and the Division for 
Crime Prevention under the Ministry of the Interior, and Open Schools7. These actions

</p>
<p>should be institutionalized and addressed in a comprehensive manner within a preventive 
and sustainable social policy, which would also be less costly.8  
</p>
<p><b> B. Justice system 
</b></p>
<p>27. Significant progress was observed in the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office with the 
adoption of the Regulations of its Human Rights Section and strategic investigation and 
prosecution in high-impact cases. These cases, including those brought by the Special 
Prosecutor Unit supported by CICIG related to extrajudicial executions, drug trafficking 
and money-laundering, among others, are encouraging signs in the fight against impunity 
and the dismantling of criminal structures. The High Commissioner encourages the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to build upon those advancements. 
</p>
<p>28. Nevertheless, the actions taken by Public Prosecutor Conrado Reyes, in office for 
only a few days between May and June 2010, which reversed many of the positive 
institutional advances regarding prosecution methodology and strategies, revealed that the 
institution is still fragile and that sustainability of achievements is a main challenge. 
</p>
<p>29. The selection processes for the posts of Public Prosecutor and Director of the Public 
Criminal Defence Institute were invalidated, given that there had been serious flaws in the 
application of the Law on Nominating Commissions. The new selection process for Public 
Prosecutor showed progress in the implementation of the Law. Claudia Paz, a prominent 
civil society lawyer, was appointed as Public Prosecutor after being selected by the 
President. Nevertheless, the decisions taken by the Nominating Commissions in the final 
stage of these processes must continue to be based on open discussions and objective 
criteria. The lessons learned should be applied during the upcoming selection of the 
magistrates of the Constitutional Court, to ensure that those selected have the authority and 
legitimacy required for these posts. 
</p>
<p>30. OHCHR-Guatemala received reports of threats to and pressure on judges, 
prosecutors and other parties to the proceedings that increase their risk level, in particular 
that of those involved in high-impact and human-rights cases. The Judiciary and the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office have yet to implement measures to ensure the protection of justice 
operators, witnesses and the accused. 
</p>
<p>31. The weak professional career system in the Judiciary and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office undermines the independence and impartiality of staff, allowing abuses, such as the 
relocation of judges as disciplinary sanctions. Nevertheless, the discussions held by the 
Supreme Court to reform the Law on the Judicial Career constitutes a positive action, the 
result of which should be in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>32. As expressed in previous reports, the Judiciary has not moved away from the 
predominant monocultural vision of justice nor has it recognized legal pluralism. Law 
faculties should promote this change. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office continued increasing efforts towards the criminal 
prosecution of emblematic cases of human rights violations which occurred during the 
</p>
<p>  
 8 &#8220;Estimates are that every dollar spent on preventing violence saves up to six dollars in the cost of 
</p>
<p>controlling and suppressing crime and dealing with its consequences.&#8221; Mayra Buvinic, in IACHR,

</b></p>
<p>internal armed conflict, remaining open to plaintiffs and victims in these cases. These 
efforts should be consolidated and broadened, taking into account the fact that only four 
prosecutors are in place to respond to violations that resulted in more than 200,000 victims, 
according to the Commission for Historical Clarification. 
</p>
<p>34. Access to information facilitates the enjoyment of the rights to truth and justice. In 
this regard, documental evidence provided by the Historical Archive of the National Police 
is a significant step. The conviction in October of two police officers for the disappearance 
of trade-union leader Edgar Fernando Garc&#237;a showed that such evidence can be decisive for 
the criminal processes. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office should use this evidence to 
investigate and prosecute high-ranking officials under command responsibility in this and 
other cases still under investigation. 
</p>
<p>35. The Supreme Court rejected the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 
(duress and due obedience to superior orders) in the case of the R&#237;o Negro massacre (1982). 
However, the resolutions of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, which failed 
to implement the decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights,9 and led to the 
closure of at least one case of gross human rights violations, have created significant gaps 
in combating impunity for past human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>36. The Commission for the Declassification of Military Archives announced progress 
in its work, but the information is not yet available to the public. The High Commissioner 
welcomes the statement made by the President affirming that technical assistance from the 
United Nations would be sought to review the documents preliminarily categorized as 
classified by this Commission, to ensure that information pertaining to cases of human 
rights violations is declassified. This constitutes an important opportunity to apply relevant 
international standards. 
</p>
<p>37. The results of an overall evaluation on the impact of the Government&#8217;s reparation 
programme for victims of the internal conflict should guide the adoption of possible 
corrective measures to ensure its compliance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>38. The situation in the penitentiary system remains critical and requires urgent 
measures as recommended repeatedly by the High Commissioner. The implementation of 
the Law on the Prison System and the adoption of its regulations are still pending. The 
treatment and conditions in places of detention for men and for women, including 
maximum security centres, do not comply with international human rights standards. It is 
worrying that the Government, citing the weaknesses of the penitentiary system, authorized 
the detention of persons in military premises.10 Although these are under the authority of 
the penitentiary system, the decision reinforces the trend towards ceding public security 
functions to the army. 
</p>
<p>39. Children and adolescents deprived of liberty, under the authority of the Social 
Welfare Secretariat, live in extremely overcrowded conditions, some of them spending 
most of the day locked up, with very limited access to recreational and educational 
activities or training, and without clear separation according to age, type of crimes or legal 
situation. OHCHR-Guatemala received information concerning cases of physical violence

<p>among juvenile detainees, and concerning the use of a military-type regime, which gives 
priority to disciplinary measures, including corporal punishment and the use of pepper 
spray, contrary to the prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. This approach 
to detention perpetuates cycles of violence, does not support reinsertion, accentuates 
marginalization, affects children&#8217;s growth and development, strengthens criminal networks, 
and increases the probability of recidivism. 
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR-Guatemala welcomes the willingness of the Social Welfare Secretariat to 
cooperate with the office and is confident that it will implement prompt and effective 
measures to guarantee both security and absolute respect of human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>41. Human rights defenders play a crucial role in the consolidation of democracy and 
the rule of law. They promote development, fight against poverty, carry out humanitarian 
work, foster the reconstruction of peace and justice and promote civil, political, economic, 
social, cultural and environmental rights. However, there is a mistaken perception among 
some sectors of society, sometimes echoed by the media, that human rights defenders 
defend criminals. It is crucial for the State to send a clear message acknowledging the 
importance of the work of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR-Guatemala observed that some groups of human rights defenders are 
particularly vulnerable to attacks, such as union, community or indigenous leaders, 
environmental rights defenders, journalists, women leaders and youth defenders. In 2010, 
250 human rights defenders were victims of attacks, the results of which included eight 
deaths.11 The murder in Solol&#225; of Leonardo Lisandro Guarcax, an indigenous promoter of 
cultural rights, on August 26, demonstrates how those involved in defending Mayan 
tradition and art come under attack. Moreover, the kidnapping and murder in 
Huehuetenango, of Emilia Quan, a sociologist at the Center for Studies and Research of the 
Guatemalan Western Frontier (CEDFOG) on 7 December reflects the insecurity and 
violence suffered by human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>43. Additionally, environmental activists such as members of the non-governmental 
Centre for Legal, Environmental and Social Action (CALAS) and the ProPet&#233;n Foundation 
are often victims of threats and violations of their rights, for defending protected areas, 
demanding socio-environmental governance and justice, transparency and sustainable 
development. No investigation into these cases has proven effective.  
</p>
<p>44. Journalists are also the target of frequent attacks. During 2010, the Human Rights 
Section of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office received 27 reports related to threats, coercion, 
injuries and other attacks against journalists.  
</p>
<p>45. The context of insecurity and violence has a negative impact on human rights 
defenders. Non-State actors such as vigilante groups, private security companies and 
organized crime are a growing threat to their security, in particular when the work of 
human right defenders threatens these actors&#8217; interests. OHCHR-Guatemala received 
information alleging the acquiescence or complicity of local authorities in some cases of 
threats to, the discrediting of, legal action against and even the murder of defenders. It is of 
concern that investigations into such serious allegations have not yet yielded results. 
</p>
<p>46. A state of exception was declared in the Department of San Marcos on 22 December 
and extended eight times during 2010. These measures restricted the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Protection Unit for Human Rights Defenders (UDEFEGUA).   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>assembly, movement and expression in the municipalities that opposed the operation of the 
electric company Uni&#243;n Fenosa, but were imposed without clear justification of the 
motives, proportionality and temporality. The murders of three leaders of the Front for the 
Defence of National Resources, Victor G&#225;lvez (24 October 2009), Evelinda Ram&#237;rez (13 
January 2010) and Octavio Robledo (17 February 2010), carried out in this context, remain 
unpunished. 
</p>
<p>47. Neither the strengthening of the Unit for the Analysis of Attacks against Human 
Rights Defenders nor the creation of a comprehensive protection programme have been 
given priority. Despite the serious insecurity faced by human rights defenders, none of the 
17 prioritized actions of the National Agreement for the Advancement of Security and 
Justice provides for the strengthening of protection measures. Moreover, insufficient 
resources for the operation and coordination of the Special Criminal Investigations 
Commission of the NCP, and national human rights institutions, weaken their capacity for 
protection, prevention and early warning.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>48. Despite a legal framework aimed at guaranteeing the right of women to live free 
from violence, prevention and eradication of violence remain a challenge. The necessary 
conditions for the equal enjoyment of women&#8217;s rights are not yet present and Guatemala 
occupies one of the lowest positions in the region in gender equality.12  
</p>
<p>49. The State breaches its international obligations to protect women&#8217;s right to life if it 
does not investigate, prosecute and provide reparations in cases of violence. Two years after 
the adoption of the Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women, the 
creation of specialized courts as provided for in the law, as well as the approval of its 
Protocol, and the National Information System on Violence against Women are signs of 
progress. The coverage of these jurisdictional entities should be widened, and the Protocol 
should be disseminated and implemented.  
</p>
<p>50. Nevertheless, impunity remains high, due to a lack of investigative resources, 
adequate training, sensitization and coordination among the authorities, as well as victims&#8217; 
fear of reprisals and economic dependency on the attacker. In addition, justice operators do 
not comply with their obligation to initiate ex officio investigations for these crimes, laying 
the burden of pursuing the cases on the victims.  
</p>
<p>51. The available protection mechanisms for victims are insufficient, and measures are 
needed to ensure the allocation of resources for the creation and sustainability of shelters. 
</p>
<p>52. The conditions and treatment of women deprived of liberty are of specific concern. 
In particular, monolingual indigenous women do not have access to interpreters during the 
judicial process and detention, infringing upon their right to defence and sentence 
commutation. 
</p>
<p>  
 12 In the <i>Global Gender Gap Report 2010</i>, the World Economic Forum ranks Guatemala 109th of 134 
</p>
<p>countries surveyed - the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean (p. 9). See 
www.weforum.org/pdf/gendergap/report2010.pdf. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual and reproductive health 
</b></p>
<p>53. The recent adoption of the Law on Healthy Motherhood (Decree 32-2010) 
constitutes a step forward toward the eradication of maternal mortality. However, medical 
coverage for women, especially in rural areas, and training for health professionals, 
including midwives and other health promoters in indigenous communities, is required. 
There was an increase in maternal deaths (275 cases in 2009 and 206 between January and 
August 2010), mostly affecting rural areas.13 The recommendation of the Human Rights 
Committee to take measures to guarantee the right to life of pregnant women who wish to 
interrupt their pregnancy has not been complied with.14 
</p>
<p>54. In 2010, 1,086 births by girls aged between 10 and 14 were registered, mostly in 
Alta Verapaz, Huehuetenango, Pet&#233;n and Santa Rosa,15 highlighting the need to adopt 
effective sexual and reproductive health measures and policies. At the same time, the lack 
of information on the causes of early pregnancies challenges the implementation of the 
State&#8217;s obligations. The ministries of health and education need to provide prompt 
comprehensive sex education based on a gender and diversity perspective and consistent 
with international human rights standards,16 not only in schools but also for the population 
excluded from the educational system. Additionally, family planning programmes for men 
and women, including access to contraception and health services, are not adequately 
designed or extended to adolescents. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>55. Structural patterns of racism persist in the political, economic and social arenas, 
which translates into various forms of discrimination against indigenous peoples. Despite 
progress achieved in formal recognition of their rights they still hold the most 
disadvantaged position in society and are subject to exclusion and poverty with no effective 
opportunities to demand and enjoy their rights, leading to a systematic de facto denial of 
their condition as rights holders. 
</p>
<p>56. The implementation of international obligations has been limited to the 
criminalization of discrimination and the creation of some governmental institutions, 
including the Presidential Commission against Discrimination and Racism against 
Indigenous Peoples (CODISRA), the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women (DEMI) 
and the so-called &#8220;indigenous desks&#8221; (directorates, departments and offices). These efforts 
are important but insufficient to ensure the State guarantee of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
under a multicultural vision. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>57. OHCHR-Guatemala has observed that discriminatory practices based on gender and 
ethnicity, known, tolerated, and in some cases carried out by State officials or with their 
acquiescence, include racial hatred, violence against women and limitations on certain 
rights, particularly education. Discrimination increases poverty levels by, inter alia, limiting 
educational and work options.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>58. The number of victims who file complaints or pursue judicial proceedings for 
discrimination is very low, due in part to the socio-economic situation of the victims and to 
the insufficient response of the judiciary. The 513 cases filed before the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office between 2005 and August 2010 indicate a general tendency for cases to be closed or 
dismissed, and not always on solid grounds. OHCHR-Guatemala has observed that when a 
victim of discrimination does not pursue a case, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office does not 
initiate ex officio investigations. Investigations regarding cases of discrimination are often 
paralyzed due to the burden of proof placed on the victim by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, 
including the requirement to provide an expert&#8217;s cultural appraisal prior to the initial 
statement of the accused, which in most cases is not useful for proving this crime. 
</p>
<p>59. The case of Candelaria Acabal Alvarado, an indigenous K&#8217;ich&#233;&#8217; woman who was 
subject to domestic servitude for 10 years under inhuman conditions (such as deprivation of 
liberty, malnutrition and corporal punishment), illustrates the serious effects of 
discrimination and racism on the physical and psychological integrity of indigenous women 
held in a contemporary form of slavery. Despite the severity of the situation, investigations 
remain pending, no punishment has been meted out to the perpetrators and no 
compensation given to the victim. 
</p>
<p>60. Information compiled by CODISRA, DEMI and OHCHR-Guatemala in six 
departments reveals that women in indigenous communities do not have sufficient 
information on their rights, complaint mechanisms and protecting institutions. Additionally, 
acts of racial and gender-based discrimination are not identified as such.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>61. In practice, the transformation from the predominant monocultural State towards a 
plural and democratic system has not yet taken place. Despite a progressive increase in 
local political participation of indigenous peoples (mainly male), the political-electoral 
system has not incorporated traditional models of indigenous participation, or mechanisms 
that guarantee the cultural and linguistic particularities with regard to the right to vote and 
to be elected. Only two Ministries - Culture and Economy - have been headed by 
indigenous persons in the current Government. There are no indigenous magistrates in the 
highest courts, and according to the Supreme Electoral Court, indigenous representation in 
Congress in the last electoral period reached an average of only 9.5 per cent, out of which 
2.56 per cent are women. Likewise, the ethno-demographic composition of the country is 
not reflected in non-elected high-level positions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to consultation 
</b></p>
<p>62. The right to consultation gives democratic access to decision-making processes on 
the development model pursued by the State. The State of Guatemala did not comply with 
its international obligation to consult indigenous peoples with the objective of achieving 
their free, prior and informed consent on all legislative or administrative measures affecting 
them directly. None of the processes by which permits were approved for the exploitation 
of natural resources to date has complied with this right. To claim their collective rights, 
some indigenous communities have held &#8220;good faith community consultations&#8221;, which 
resulted in the rejection of specific projects and mining activities in their territories.  
</p>
<p>63. The Government has held that it has not granted new mining permits, a de facto moratorium that should be formalized and extended to the exploitation of other natural 
resources in indigenous territories if the right to consultation is not previously guaranteed. 
The State should urgently regulate this right in accordance with international standards and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>the legal instrument regulating it should be widely consulted upon. Even in the absence of 
such regulations, the State should immediately initiate consultation processes. 
</p>
<p>64. The lack of consultation and of proper forms of land ownership, among other 
structural causes, has resulted in serious conflicts throughout the country. Community 
leaders have been subject to harassment, attacks and sexual violence, and no prompt and 
proper investigations and judicial proceedings have been carried out. In stark contrast, 
members of indigenous communities have been subjected to rapid judicial proceedings in 
the context of social protests, in which legitimate acts in defense of human rights are often 
criminalized. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>65. With a human development index of 0.56, Guatemala is ranked 116th among 169 
countries.17 Despite important steps registered in the past two decades, Guatemala still lies 
behind the Latin American average index (0.70).18 To overcome this gap, Guatemala must 
strengthen its efforts to level the structural conditions of inequality that hinder its 
development. 
</p>
<p>66. The High Commissioner recognizes the increase in social investment in the past 
three years, but reiterates the need for Congress to ensure the resources necessary to fulfil 
the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations. A key factor in guaranteeing the 
sustainability of social expenditure, as argued in previous reports of the High 
Commissioner, is to undertake a thorough fiscal reform and to overcome the high 
dependency on indirect taxes. The urgency of this measure has been revealed by the 
decrease in tax levels from 12.9 per cent in 2007 to 10.4 per cent19 in 2010.  
</p>
<p>67. During 2010, investments in the conditional cash transfer programme Mi Familia 
Progresa increased steadily. Efforts to extend the impact of these programmes are positive, 
but there is a need to guarantee their stability and transparency through a strong legal 
framework. Moreover, a human rights-based approach should be incorporated, in line with 
the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food (A/HRC/13/33/Add.4, 
para. 87 (b)). Such programmes should not undermine or replace the institutions 
responsible for ensuring the universality of social rights. 
</p>
<p>68. In 2010, climate-related events affected 723,736 people, resulted in 263 deaths and 
damaged livelihoods,20 compounding the problems provoked by Hurricane Mitch and 
Tropical Storm Stan. Although the State has taken concrete measures to reduce risks, it has 
not yet consolidated a national strategy on prevention and relief or on risk and vulnerability 
assessment, which would limit the negative impact of these phenomena, particularly for 
those who depend on local self-sustainability (see A/HRC/10/61). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to food  
</b></p>
<p>69. Following the food crisis in 2009, the Government adopted measures that allowed 
for progress in coordinated actions with civil society organizations and the international

</b></p>
<p>community regarding medical equipment, auxiliary nurses, teachers and nutritionists, and 
the production of disaggregated information on cases of acute malnutrition.  
</p>
<p>70. Nevertheless, the limited availability and lack of sustainable access to food persist 
due to several factors, including the insufficiency of the current minimum wage to cover the 
basic food basket, the lack of access to land and the gradual weakening of key institutions 
for the development of peasant economies, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock 
and Food (MAGA) and the land fund (FONTIERRA). In 2010, the Ministry of Public 
Health and Social Assistance registered 14,666 cases of acute malnutrition, in comparison 
with 5,320 cases in 2009.21 The numbers reported are alarmingly high and demonstrate the 
continued effects of the food crisis, but also more accurate reporting. 
</p>
<p>71. It is necessary to implement a comprehensive rural development policy and to 
strengthen the legal framework on this subject in accordance with human rights standards in 
order to reduce dependency and to guarantee complete and equitable access to the resources 
and means needed for an adequate standard of living, with a special focus on discriminated 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>72. The implementation of the policy of free pre-primary, primary and secondary 
education, adopted in November 2008, is a fundamental achievement in breaking the cycle 
of exclusion and poverty. In order to maintain this progress, the Ministry of Education must 
adequately address the challenges posed by the increased demand, particularly the 
inefficient administrative mechanisms for the distribution of funds, and the hiring and 
designation of a sufficient number of teachers.  
</p>
<p>73. There is still a need to guarantee quality education, in particular at rural and 
indigenous schools, especially those with bilingual and inter-cultural programmes. The 
High Commissioner calls upon the authorities to improve efficiency regarding the 
inspection and evaluation of educational facilities, both public and private, and to adopt 
adequate measures to improve the quality of education. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>74. For the tenth consecutive year, the budget allocated to health remained at an average 
of 1.2 per cent of the GDP, one of the lowest in the region.22 This translated into a persistent 
lack of medical staff, medications, supplies and basic materials. Despite the fact that the 
2011 budget for the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance increased by 35 
million quetzales, it represents only 7.22 per cent of the annual budget, which is less than 
what was designated in 2010. The assigned funds remain insufficient, in particular with 
regard to the Coverage Extension Programme, which brings basic health services to nearly 
a third of the population: the poorest and most excluded, who are mainly rural and 
indigenous. As highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the procurement 
system also allows Government officials too much discretion in determining which

</p>
<p>companies to contract with, and leaves open the possibility for abuse.23 This could limit the 
availability of and access to medication and other supplies. 
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR-Guatemala received information regarding cases of discrimination against 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by public officials within the health services. 
These acts include humiliating gestures and attitudes, a lack of adequate medical attention 
and the violation of the right to confidentiality. 
</p>
<p><b> IX.  Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>76. OHCHR-Guatemala conducted field missions to monitor the human rights situation, 
and held meetings with authorities, public institutions, social organizations, witnesses, 
victims and their families to follow up on reports of possible human rights violations. The 
office issued press releases on several human rights issues. It disseminated the 2009 annual 
report on the activities of the office in Guatemala (A/HRC/13/26/Add.1) and held press 
conferences and meetings with opinion leaders. 
</p>
<p>77. OHCHR-Guatemala monitored the situation of human rights defenders, the election 
process of the Public Prosecutor, as well as judicial processes concerning human rights 
violations of the past. It also supported the Dialogue Table between the communities 
affected by the Chixoy Hydroelectric Plant and the Government.  
</p>
<p>78. OHCHR-Guatemala supported the visits of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
health and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people, in May and June 2010, respectively. It also advised social 
organizations on drafting shadow reports for submission to the Committee on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and to the Human 
Rights Committee.  
</p>
<p>79. Congress was provided with technical assistance on the main draft security laws 
prioritized in the National Agreement for the Advancement of Security and Justice. 
OHCHR-Guatemala also supported dialogue on initiatives regarding rural development and 
the national compensation programme as well as the law on the National Commission for 
the Search of Victims of Enforced Disappearances and the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and opposed those draft laws 
incompatible with international standards, such as the draft laws against youth gangs (anti-
mara) and the draft law on the commutation of sentences for persons on death row. 
</p>
<p>80. With the Presidential Commission on Human Rights (COPREDEH), the 
Ombudspersons&#8217;s Office and social organizations, OHCHR-Guatemala provided technical 
advice on the law concerning the national preventive mechanism against torture.  
</p>
<p>81. Cooperation with the Constitutional Court included capacity-building activities on 
international human rights standards for judicial clerks and magistrates, a public forum and 
two round tables. An agreement was established for the drafting of specialized documents 
to complement the Constitutional Court&#8217;s analyses regarding international human rights 
standards.

<p>82. With the School of Judicial Trainers, OHCHR-Guatemala developed a practical 
module on the use of international standards in the resolution of cases and another on 
economic, social and cultural rights. Technical advice was provided to the Supreme Court 
in drafting the proposed legal reforms for the judicial profession. 
</p>
<p>83. Capacity-building activities on human rights and international humanitarian law 
were held for three units of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. In coordination with Impunity 
Watch, OHCHR-Guatemala held a workshop on human rights protection mechanisms for 
social organizations specialized in transitional justice. 
</p>
<p>84. OHCHR-Guatemala produced and disseminated a CD on international human rights 
standards. It also published an <i>amicus </i>brief on enforced disappearance and the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers (A/HRC/11/41/Add.3), who 
visited the country in 2009. The office supported the Working Group on Transitional 
Justice, and the Transitional Justice Programme (PAJUST) under the United Nations 
Development Programme in Guatemala. It also supported several inter-agency groups and 
led the inter-agency working group on security and justice. 
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR-Guatemala, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) 
and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) organized the presentation of the joint 
&#8220;Report on citizen security and human rights&#8221; with the participation of IACHR 
Commissioner Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro. In coordination with the Instituto Centroamericano 
de Estudios para la Democracia Social, it held a forum on freedom of expression, with the 
participation of rapporteurs of the Organization of American States and the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>86. The office held workshops on the right to consultation for Government officials, 
indigenous authorities, civil society organizations, journalists and the private sector, and 
disseminated information regarding this right throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR-Guatemala, jointly with CODISRA and DEMI, implemented the project 
entitled &#8220;Contributing to the eradication of racism and ethnic and gender discrimination, 
particularly against indigenous women&#8221; (funded by the Government of Germany) and 
followed up on the national campaign entitled &#8220;Indigenous women have rights; we demand 
that they be met&#8221;, through radio advertisements and interviews in community radio stations 
in six departments, and through workshops with female indigenous leaders. 
</p>
<p>88. Capacity-building workshops were held with officials of the legal units of 
CODISRA and DEMI, and with prosecutors across the country to strengthen investigation, 
prosecution and criminal procedures against discrimination. OHCHR-Guatemala 
disseminated approximately 800,000 copies of six capacity-building kits for children on 
human rights, discrimination and indigenous women&#8217;s rights. It also produced a study on 
discrimination within the judicial system, a manual on strategic litigation in cases of 
discrimination and a compilation on international standards on discrimination, which was 
disseminated nationwide. 
</p>
<p>89. Within the framework of the Maya Programme (funded by the Government of 
Norway), OHCHR-Guatemala continued to implement the Technical Training Programme 
for Strategic Human Rights Litigation for Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights addressed to 
university students and representatives of 24 indigenous organizations. In all, 12 technical 
programmes for strategic litigation (on the rights to consultation, natural resources, land, 
non-discrimination and cultural rights) were designed, and the students completed an 
internship programme. In cooperation with the Mariano G&#225;lvez, the San Carlos and Rafael 
Land&#237;var Universities, training programmes were initiated for a second group of indigenous 
organizations, university students and professors. 
</p>
<p>90. OHCHR-Guatemala organized training programmes on human rights indicators for 
officials from several public institutions. Together with the Food and Agriculture </p>

</p>
<p>91. OHCHR started to implement the project entitled &#8220;Education and promotion of the 
rights of children and youth&#8221; (funded by the Catalan Agency for Development 
Cooperation) and produced educational material, including a CD with interactive games for 
children. Four websites were created and more than 43,500 copies of publications were 
distributed. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Follow-up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>92. The adoption of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is still 
pending. The recognition of the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, and adherence to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are also pending.24 
</p>
<p>93. Achievements in compliance with previous recommendations on justice are still 
limited, isolated and lacking sustainability. Particularly urgent is the implementation of 
those relating to the establishment of an inter-institutional coordination mechanism for 
criminal investigation and prosecution,25 the system of professional careers,26 and access to 
justice based on the principles of non-discrimination, and cultural and linguistic 
appropriateness.27 Regarding human rights violations committed during the armed conflict, 
it is necessary to increase efforts to investigate, prosecute and sanction the masterminds and 
perpetrators and provide comprehensive reparations to the victims.28 
</p>
<p>94. There is still a need to take effective measures to implement all the 
recommendations aimed at protecting the right to life and integrity, mainly through 
strengthening public security institutions; controlling firearms possession; preventing 
violence, particularly lynching; and ensuring effective access to justice for victims.29 In and 
of itself, the lack of funds cannot be used to explain the absence of concrete measures to 
move towards a State that guarantees security and justice. 
</p>
<p>95. The adoption of the law establishing a national prevention mechanism against 
torture represents an important step. Congress should effectively establish the mechanism

<p>and allocate sufficient budget. Nevertheless, it is still urgent to implement the 
recommendations aimed at reducing overcrowding in detention centres, mainly by 
rationalizing the use of deprivation of liberty and using alternatives to detention; 
guaranteeing the integrity, security and life of all persons deprived of liberty; and 
improving conditions of detention.30 Effective access to all places of detention, including 
NGO monitoring visits, should be guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>96. Efforts to implement the recommendations on protection of human rights defenders 
and to promote the crucial role they fulfil toward strengthening democracy and the rule of 
law should be strengthened.31 Cooperation and coordination between the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Human Rights Section and district and municipal prosecutors should also be 
reinforced together with the analysis and identification of patterns of violations. 
</p>
<p>97. The reinforcement of the investigative capacity and sensitization of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the NCP on cases of violence against women are also pending. 
</p>
<p>98. Regarding economic, social and cultural rights, the High Commissioner reiterates 
her recommendations concerning fiscal reform,32 budgetary increase,33 the incorporation of 
a human rights and gender perspective to social policy,34 the decentralization of public 
services and programmes in urban areas,35 discriminated and/or vulnerable groups,36 and the 
creation of indicators and monitoring mechanisms.37 The High Commissioner has 
welcomed important efforts regarding free education and recommended its consolidation 
and sustainability,38 as well as compliance with minimum core obligations in order to break 
cycles of hunger39 and the creation of monitoring and law-enforcement mechanisms related 
to labour conditions.40 These positive steps should be accompanied with measures that are, 
inter alia, sustainable, accountable, non-discriminatory and that offer adequate quality while 
maximizing the use of available resources. 
</p>
<p>99. The High Commissioner has made recommendations on the rights of indigenous 
peoples to access to justice, the fight against racism and discrimination and consultation. 
OHCHR-Guatemala values the efforts undertaken by the Government in this area and 
emphasizes that there is still a long way to go for the effective implementation of all those 
recommendations.41

<p><b> XI.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>In 2008 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed 
the fact that the Government accepted all the recommendations made under the 
universal periodic review. She now welcomes efforts taken in this regard and renews 
her call on all State institutions to promptly adopt the necessary measures to 
implement all of these recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The decisions and recommendations from protection mechanisms of the United 
Nations System and the Inter-American System, including the recommendations 
issued by OHCHR since 2005, constitute a sound, precise and comprehensive guide 
for Guatemala to advance in the field of human rights. Hence, the High Commissioner 
recommends relevant institutions to implement these recommendations in a timely 
manner. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The High Commissioner urges the State to make use of the database on follow-
up to international recommendations created by the Presidential Commission on 
Human Rights (COPREDEH), not only to implement these in an inter-institutional 
and coordinated manner, but also to open a space for an annual national evaluation of 
compliance with these recommendations, with broad participation of civil society and 
the international community.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>In the context of the process towards the election in 2011 of the President and 
local authorities, the High Commissioner invites all political parties to commit to the 
implementation of these recommendations, incorporate them in their programme 
agendas, and consider affirmative actions in favour of women and indigenous people, 
such as quotas for high-level positions, both on voting ballots and in public 
institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon the international community to ensure that 
its cooperation activities are aimed at strengthening compliance with international 
human rights obligations, while sustaining cooperation that enhances State 
accountability, and promoting an effective institutionalization and continuity of 
projects and programmes that have a proven impact on human rights protection.
