font-family:Times New Roman">We are conducting a rights offering and we are 
issuing, at no charge, one transferable subscription right with respect to each 
share of our
common stock outstanding as of the close of business on&nbsp;August 25, 2016. 
Holders of subscription rights will be entitled to purchase 0.099&nbsp;shares of
our common stock for each subscription right held at an exercise price of $12.25
per whole
share. If all of the subscription rights are exercised in the rights offering, 
the total purchase price of all of our common stock sold in the rights offering 
will be approximately $50&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:8pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Each stockholder who fully exercises his, her or 
its basic subscription privilege may also subscribe for additional shares that 
other
stockholders do not purchase through exercise of their basic subscription 
privilege at the same exercise price per whole share pursuant to the 
oversubscription privilege. If an insufficient number of shares are available to
fully satisfy
oversubscription privilege requests, the available shares will be allocated pro 
rata among stockholders who exercised their oversubscription privilege based 
upon the total number of shares held by such stockholders, including the number 
of shares
each stockholder subscribed for under the basic subscription privilege, and the 
application of our certificate of incorporation&#146;s ownership change 
limitations. Fractional shares or cash in lieu of fractional shares will not be 
issued in the
rights offering. Instead, fractional shares of our common stock resulting from 
the exercise of the basic subscription privilege and the oversubscription 
privilege will be rounded down to the nearest whole share of common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:8pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The subscription rights are exercisable beginning 
on the date of this prospectus and will expire if they are not exercised by 5:00
p.m., New
York City time, on&nbsp;September 14, 2016, unless extended by us from time to 
time in our sole discretion. Subscription rights that are not exercised by the 
expiration date of the rights offering will expire and will have no value. 
Stockholders who
exercise their subscription rights will not be entitled to revoke their 
exercise. Stockholders who do not exercise their subscription rights will 
relinquish any value inherent in the subscription rights and their relative 
ownership level of our
outstanding common stock will decrease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On 
July&nbsp;14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests
of Hermes
Consolidated, LLC, d/b/a Wyoming Refining Company, which owns and operates a 
refinery in Newcastle, Wyoming and, through its wholly owned subsidiary, certain
associated logistics assets. In connection with the acquisition, we issued 
approximately
$52.6 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% convertible subordinated bridge
notes. Proceeds of this rights offering will be used to prepay or repay the 
bridge notes. Bridge notes which are not repaid with the proceeds of this rights
offering
will be converted into shares of common stock in accordance with their terms.

subscription
rights using this prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
subscription rights by our affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:3pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>In 
order to avoid
an &#147;ownership change&#148; for federal income tax purposes, our certificate
of incorporation contains ownership limitations that restrict the transfer of 
Company Securities (as defined therein) (i)&nbsp;by holders who are, or would 
become as a
result of such transfer, a holder of at least 5% of our stock (a &#147;5% 
Shareholder&#148;), within the meaning of Section&nbsp;382 of the United States 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;) and 
(ii)&nbsp;by any holder to
the extent such transfer would increase the ownership of our Company Securities 
by any 5% Shareholder. For this purpose, whether a person is a 5% Shareholder is
generally determined by taking into account all Company Securities owned by such
holder.
Consequently, there are limitations on the transfer and exercise of the 
subscription rights as described in this prospectus under &#147;The Rights 
Offering &#151; Certificate of Incorporation Restrictions; Escrow Protection 
Mechanics.&#148; </B></P>

producing natural gas in Garfield, Mesa and Rio Blanco Counties, Colorado. On 
December&nbsp;17, 2015,
we entered into an equity commitment letter with Laramie Energy, pursuant to 
which we agreed to purchase certain membership interests of Laramie Energy for 
an aggregate cash purchase price of $55 million, subject to certain financing 
commitments by
various lenders and additional equity investors, in connection with the closing 
of a purchase and sale agreement whereby Laramie Energy agreed to acquire 
certain properties in the Piceance Basin for $157.5 million, subject to 
customary purchase
price adjustments. The transaction closed on March&nbsp;1, 2016 and, upon the 
closing of the transaction, Laramie Energy assumed ownership and operatorship of

formerly Koko&#146;oha Investments, Inc.), which owns 100% of the outstanding 
membership interests of Mid Pac Petroleum, LLC (&#147;Mid Pac&#148;), for cash 
consideration of approximately $74.4 million and the assumption of $45.3 million
of debt.
The results of operations of Mid Pac are included in our refining, retail and 
logistics segments effective April&nbsp;1, 2015. Mid Pac distributes gasoline 
and diesel through over 80 locations across the State of Hawaii and owns four 
terminals. In
conjunction with the acquisition, we also obtained the exclusive rights to the 
&#147;76&#148; brand in Hawaii through 2024. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt;

to the three operating segments described above, we have two additional 
reportable segments: (i)&nbsp;Texadian and (ii)&nbsp;Corporate and Other. 
Texadian focuses on sourcing, marketing, transporting and distributing crude oil
and refined products
in the U.S. and Canada. Corporate and Other includes administrative costs and 
several small non-operated oil and gas interests that were owned by our 
predecessor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">We were created through the successful 
reorganization of Delta Petroleum Corporation (&#147;Delta&#148;) in August 
2012. The reorganization
converted approximately $265 million of unsecured debt to equity and allowed us 
to preserve significant tax attributes, including a net operating loss that has 
a balance of approximately $1.4 billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. We changed
our name
from Par Petroleum Corporation to Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. effective 
October&nbsp;20, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Our refinery is located in Kapolei, Hawaii on the 
Island of Oahu on approximately 130 fee-owned acres about 20 miles west of 
Honolulu and is
rated at 94&nbsp;thousand barrels per day throughput. We source our crude oil 
from North America, South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Russia and 
other sources. The refinery&#146;s major processing units include crude 
distillation, vacuum
distillation, visbreaking, hydrocracking, naphtha hydrotreating and reforming 
units, which produce ultra-low sulfur diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, marine fuel, 
LSFO and other associated refined products. We believe the configuration of our 
refinery
uniquely meets the demands of the Hawaii market, particularly given the 
State&#146;s strong demand for distillates and fuel oil. </P> <P STYLE="margin-
top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">Crude
oil is transported to Hawaii in tankers, which discharge through our single-
point mooring (&#147;SPM&#148;). Our three underwater pipelines from the SPM 
allow crude oil and refined products to be transferred to and from the refinery.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Crude oil is received into the refinery tank farm, 
which consists of 2.4&nbsp;million barrels of total crude oil storage. Following
crude oil
receipt, we process the crude oil through the various refining units into 
products and store them in the refinery&#146;s 2.5&nbsp;million barrels of 
product tankage. The refinery storage capacity allows us to manage the various
product requirements
of the State of Hawaii. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-
indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have Supply and 
Offtake Agreements with J. Aron&nbsp;&amp; Company (&#147;J. Aron&#148;) that 
allow us to
finance our hydrocarbon inventories. Under the Supply and Offtake Agreements, J.
Aron holds title to all crude oil and refined product stored in tankage at the 
refinery. We purchase crude oil from J. Aron on a daily basis at market prices 
and sell
refined products to J. Aron as they are produced. We repurchase these refined 
products from J.&nbsp;Aron prior to selling them to third parties. </P>

through our logistics network to wholesale and bulk customers and to our retail 
business.
Wholesale customers include jobbers and other non-end users, as well as 37
fueling stations where operations and consumer pricing are controlled by third 
parties. Bulk customers include utilities, military bases, marine vessels, 
industrial end-users
and exports. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; 
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The profitability of our refining 
business is heavily influenced by crack spreads in both the Singapore and U.S. 
West Coast
markets. These markets reflect the closest, liquid market alternatives to source
refined products for Hawaii. We believe the Singapore 4-1-2-1 and Mid Pacific 4-
1-2-1 crack spreads (or four barrels of Brent converted into one barrel of 
gasoline, two
barrels of distillate (jet fuel and diesel) and one barrel of fuel oil) best 
reflect a market indicator for our operations. During the course of 2015, both 
markets exhibited significant volatility with lows reached during the fourth 
quarter. The
Singapore 4-1-2-1 crack spread averaged $6.88 per barrel during 2015 with a low 
of $5.44 per barrel in the fourth quarter and a high of $8.24 per barrel in the 
second quarter. The Mid Pacific 4-1-2-1 crack spread averaged $8.31 per barrel 
during
2015 with a low of $6.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and a high of $9.76 
per barrel in the second quarter. During the first six months of 2016, the Mid 
Pacific 4-1-2-1 crack spread averaged $4.22 per barrel, and the Singapore 4-1-2-
1 crack
spread averaged $2.92 per barrel. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 
a declining crude oil market, we tend to benefit from expanding crack spreads as
our product
portfolio pricing terms tend to lag our crude oil pricing terms (&#147;pricing 
lag effect&#148;). A good portion of our contracts typically price at least one 
week in arrears and some of our utility customer contracts have at least a one 
month lag
in the pricing terms. Our overall crack spreads benefited from the pricing lag 
effect as the crude oil market experienced a decline in prices throughout 2015. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we began economically hedging the pricing lag
effect.

text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our logistics 
network extends
throughout the state of Hawaii. On Oahu, the system begins with our SPM located 
1.7 miles offshore of our refinery. This SPM allows for the safe, reliable and 
efficient receipt of crude shipments to the refinery, as well as both the 
receipt and
export of finished products. Connecting the SPM to the refinery are three 
undersea pipelines: a 30-inch line for crude oil and a 20-inch line and a 16-
inch line, both for the import or export of refined products. From the refinery 
gate, we
distribute refined products through our logistics network throughout the island 
of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii, Molokai and Kauai. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The Oahu logistics network also includes a 27-mile 
wholly owned and operated pipeline network that transports refined products from
our
refinery to delivery locations. The majority of our Oahu refined product volumes
are distributed through the Honolulu Products Pipeline to (i)&nbsp;our leased 
and operated Sand Island terminal, (ii)&nbsp;the Honolulu International Airport,
(iii)&nbsp;interconnections to Navy and Air Force fuel facilities and 
(iv)&nbsp;a third-party terminal in Honolulu Harbor. In addition to the Honolulu
Products Pipeline, we own four proprietary pipelines connecting our refinery to 
Kalaeloa Barbers
Point Harbor, approximately three miles from the refinery. The four pipelines 
deliver refined products to barges for distribution to the neighboring islands 
or export, as well as interconnecting with the other local refinery, the local 
utility
pipeline and storage network and another third-party terminal on the west side 
of Oahu. The Oahu pipeline network is generally configured to be bidirectional, 
allowing for both delivery and receipt of products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We 
believe our operations
are well positioned to benefit from the attractive attributes of the Hawaii 
market. Continued demand for refined products is partially driven by the ongoing
growth in the State&#146;s economy. The Hawaii State Department of Business, 
Economic
Development and Tourism (&#147;DBEDT&#148;) reported a population increase of 3%
from 2013 to 2015. Real personal income growth is projected by DBEDT to be 3% 
for 2016. Tourism is also a major driver of refined product demand. The number 
of visitors
arriving on Hawaii by air has also increased over time. During 2015, visitor 
arrivals increased 4.1% and continued growth is forecasted. The significant 
military presence in Hawaii further increases demand for jet fuel above those 
required for
tourism aviation requirements. In addition, Hawaii utilizes petroleum products 
for approximately 70% of its electricity generation, which fits well with our 
refinery&#146;s output of approximately 23% fuel oil from 2015 through the first
six months
of 2016. </P>

Located Refinery
with Advantageous Access to Crude Oil Supply</I></B>. The strategic location of 
our refinery enables us to access global crude oil commodity flows. As a result,
we have the flexibility to utilize a wide range of crude oil blends, which we 
believe
helps to improve our realized margins. For example, in the first six months of 
2016, we sourced our crude oil from North America (45%), Asia (33%), Africa 
(13%),&nbsp;the Middle East (6%), and Latin America (4%). In addition, we 
believe that our
access to global crude oil commodity flows reduces the likelihood of an 
interruption to our supply and facilitates optimal crude oil purchasing and 
blending. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Substantial Refinery Operating 
Flexibility</I></B>. Our refinery can process a variety of crude grades and has 
the most complex yield
profile in Hawaii. The refinery is currently configured to produce a significant
volume of high margin distillate yield (primarily jet fuel and diesel) in order 
to meet the demand in Hawaii and to complement our production of gasoline, high 
sulfur
fuel oil, low sulfur fuel oil and other associated refined products. In 
addition, we have the capability to adjust our refinery configuration to produce
different yields of refined products. This provides significant flexibility as 
we can quickly
adapt to changing supply and demand trends in Hawaii. This configuration also 
allows us to produce certain products that are unique relative to our refining 
competitor in Hawaii. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Integrated Logistics and Retail Assets that 
Provide Economies of Scale</I></B>. We have an integrated network of logistics 
assets that,
coupled with our substantial distribution platform, enhances our ability to sell
our refined products within the favorable Hawaii market. By keeping our refined 
products on-island in the retail and wholesale markets, we are able to realize
significant cost savings by avoiding freight and other costs for export sales. 
In addition, accessing these additional sources of demand enables us to increase
throughput at our refinery thereby decreasing our production costs on a per 
barrel basis
and enhancing our profitability. These assets would be difficult for our peers 
to replicate, and thus provide us with a significant competitive advantage. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Attractive Refined Products Supply/Demand 
Dynamics</I></B>. Hawaii exhibits several refined products demand trends that 
are positive for
our business, including an increase in commercial air travel to Hawaii, 
substantial military jet fuel utilization and primarily fuel oil-based 
electricity generation. We benefit from the fact that the market prices for 
refined products in Hawaii
typically include a premium over other regions within the continental U.S. 
Additionally, our ability to differentiate our refinery&#146;s configuration 
provides us with the flexibility to adjust our refined product yields to meet 
the demands of
Hawaii&#146;s market. Our refinery capacity represents approximately 64% of 
Hawaii&#146;s total refining capacity enabling us to benefit from these trends.

change, our
certificate of incorporation restricts the ability of any 5% Shareholder to sell
or otherwise transfer any shares owned by such holder or to purchase or 
otherwise acquire shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation 
also restricts
the ability of any other holder to make an acquisition of our common stock which
will result in total ownership by 5% Shareholders. These restrictions will apply
unless and until we determine that such acquisition will not result in an 
unreasonable
risk of an ownership change. We have the right, in our sole and absolute 
discretion, to limit the exercise of subscription rights, including instructing 
the subscription agent to refuse to honor any exercise of subscription rights by
5% Shareholders

offering entitles you to purchase 0.099 shares of our common stock at an 
exercise price of $12.25 per whole share. You may exercise any number of your 
subscription
rights, or you may choose not to exercise any of the subscription rights issued 
to you. Fractional shares or cash in lieu of fractional shares will not be 
issued in the rights offering. Instead, fractional shares resulting from the 
exercise of the

font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determined the ratio of rights 
required to
purchase one share by dividing $50 million by the exercise price of $12.25 per 
whole share to determine the number of shares to be issued in the rights 
offering and then dividing the number of shares to be issued in the rights 
offering by the number
of shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date. Accordingly, each 
subscription right allows the holder thereof to subscribe for 0.099 shares of 
common stock at the exercise price of $12.25 per whole share of common stock. As
an
example, if you owned 1,500 shares of common stock as of the record date, you 
would receive 1,500 subscription rights. To calculate the number of shares you 
would have the right to purchase pursuant to your subscription rights, you would
multiply
(a) the 0.099 shares per subscription right by (b) your 1,500 shares, to get a 
product of 148.5 shares. Because fractional shares of common stock will not be 
issued in this rights offering, you would be entitled to purchase 148 shares of 
common
stock in this rights offering, for a total payment of $1,813 (148 total shares 
multiplied by the exercise price of $12.25 per whole share of common stock).

high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and
uncertainties
described below, together with all of the other information contained or 
incorporated by reference into this prospectus before deciding to invest in our 
common stock. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in 
this prospectus
or in the documents incorporated by reference herein, actually occurs, our 
business, business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the trading 
price of our
common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
The risks described below and in the documents incorporated by reference herein 
are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known 
to us or
that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This prospectus 
also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors,

such transfer, 5% Shareholders and (ii)&nbsp;by any holder to the extent such 
transfer would
increase the ownership of our Company Securities by any 5% Shareholder. For this
purpose, whether a person is a 5% Shareholder is generally determined by taking 
into account all Company Securities owned by such holder. Transfers of Company
Securities by 5% Shareholders are generally prohibited without the written 
approval of the Board, which may be granted or denied in the sole discretion of 
the Board. </P>

the 5% Shareholders are permitted to transfer among our remaining emergence 5%

may be reduced in order to eliminate that risk. We may also limit the exercise 
of

general market declines, interruptions to our business, accidents or other

taxable distribution with respect to your existing shares of common stock. The 
disproportionate distribution rules are complicated, however, and their 
application is
uncertain, and thus counsel is not rendering an opinion regarding the 
application of such rules. Accordingly, it is possible that the IRS could

undertake significant
remediation efforts and other corrective actions. The Wyoming Refinery, owned by
Wyoming Refining Company, is subject to a number of consent decrees, orders, and
settlement agreements involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or 
the
Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, some of which date back to the late
1970s and several of which remain in effect, requiring further actions at the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

Wyoming Refinery, the largest cost component arising from these various decrees 
relates to
the investigation, monitoring, and remediation of soil, groundwater, surface 
water, and sediment contamination associated with the facility&#146;s historic 
operations. Investigative work by Wyoming Refining Company and negotiations with
the relevant
agencies as to remedial approaches remain ongoing on a number of aspects of the 
contamination, meaning that investigation, monitoring, and remediation costs are
not reasonably estimable for some elements of these efforts. Based on current
information, however, preliminary estimates we have received for the well-
understood components of these efforts suggest total response costs of 
approximately $22.5 million, approximately one-third of which we expect to incur
in the next five years,
with the remainder being incurred over approximately 30 years. We have the right
to seek indemnification from the seller under the Acquisition Agreement for 
breaches of representations and warranties related to environmental matters, 
subject to the
limitations on indemnification provided therein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt;

approximately $11.6 million to design and construct a new wastewater treatment 
system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-

consent
decrees, orders, and settlement agreements into which the Wyoming Refinery has 
entered, there are several penalty orders associated with exceedances of 
permitted limits by the Wyoming Refinery&#146;s wastewater discharges. Although
the frequency of
these exceedances appears to be declining over time, we may become subject to 
new penalty enforcement action in the next several years, which could involve 
penalties in excess of $100,000. Moreover, in addition to the issues associated 
with the
Wyoming Refinery, certain product pipeline assets were acquired in the Wyoming 
Refining Acquisition. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration 
(&#147;PHMSA&#148;) recently conducted an integrated inspection of the products 
pipeline with
additional follow-up regarding integrity management planning and general 
operations and maintenance. Based on preliminary discussions with PHMSA 
following this inspection, the Wyoming Refinery anticipates a civil penalty in 
excess of $100,000. In
connection with our acquisition of, and commencement of operations at, the 
Wyoming Refinery, findings of a past failure to comply with applicable 
environmental or pipeline safety laws and regulations may trigger a variety of 
administrative, civil
and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary 
penalties that could be in excess of $100,000, the imposition of investigatory, 
remedial or corrective actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future 
operations or imposing
additional compliance requirements on such operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

crude oil, the constantly changing margin between the price we pay for crude oil
and other
refinery feedstocks and the prices we receive for refined products (&#147;crack

fuels we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our business

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-
size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The EPA has issued Renewable Fuel 
Standard
(&#147;RFS&#148;) mandates, requiring refiners such as us to blend renewable 
fuels into the petroleum fuels they produce and sell in the U.S. We, and other 
refiners subject to RFS, may meet the RFS requirements by blending the necessary
volumes of
renewable fuels produced by us or purchased from third parties. To the extent 
that refiners will not or cannot blend renewable fuels into the products they 
produce in the quantities required to satisfy their obligations under the RFS 
program, those
refiners must purchase renewable credits, referred to as renewable 
identification numbers (&#147;RINs&#148;), to maintain compliance. To the extent
that we exceed the minimum volumetric requirements for blending of renewable 
fuels, we generate our
own RINs that we have the option of retaining for current or future RFS 
compliance or selling on the open market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">Under the RFS program,
the volume of renewable fuels that obligated parties are required to blend into 
their finished petroleum fuels increases annually over time until 2022. Our 
refinery in Hawaii and the Wyoming Refinery are subject to compliance with the 
RFS mandates.
On November&nbsp;30, 2015, the EPA issued final volume mandates for the years 
2014 through 2016, which are generally lower than the corresponding statutory 
mandates for those years. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Existing laws, regulations or regulatory 
initiatives could change and, notwithstanding that the EPA&#146;s proposed 
volume mandates for 2014
through 2016 are generally lower than the corresponding statutory mandate for 
those years, the final minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended 
with refined petroleum fuels could increase in the future. Despite a decline in 
RINs prices
from relatively higher levels observed during mid-2013, we cannot currently 
predict the future prices of RINs and, thus, the expenses related to acquiring 
RINs in the future could increase relative to the cost in prior years. During
2015, we paid
$6.3 million for RINs and expect to pay approximately the same amount in 2016 
for our Hawaii refinery. We also expect to incur additional expenses related to 
acquiring RINs for our Wyoming Refinery in 2016. Any increase in the final 
minimum volumes
of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels, and/or any
increase in the cost to acquire RINs has the potential to result in significant 
costs in connection with RINs compliance for 2016 and future years, which costs 
could be
material and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial 
condition, and results of operations. Finally, while there is no current 
regulatory standard that authenticates RINs that may be purchased on the open 
market from third
parties, we believe that the RINs we purchase are from reputable sources, are 
valid and serve to demonstrate compliance with applicable RFS requirements. 
However, if this belief proves incorrect and the RINs that we purchase are not 
valid or in
compliance with applicable RFS requirements, our financial condition and cash 
flows may be adversely effected. </P>

for every
subscription right you hold, by delivery of the required documents, and payment 
of the exercise price. There is no minimum number of shares you must purchase as

all fractional shares, among those oversubscribing stockholders. &#147;Pro

stockholders, including the number of shares each stockholder subscribed for 
under the basic

us and certain related persons present a heightened risk of conflicts of

to ensure that we act in the best interests of our stockholders, the Board has 
delegated the review and approval of related party transactions to the Audit 
Committee in accordance with our written Audit Committee Charter. After its 
review, the Audit
Committee will only approve or ratify transactions that are fair to us and not 
inconsistent with the best interests of us and our stockholders. Any director 
who has an interest in a related party transaction will recuse himself from any
consideration of such related party transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt;

be subject to differing interpretations, perhaps retroactively, which could 
result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized

Section 305 of the Code, the receipt by U.S. holders of stock of a corporation 
of rights to subscribe for additional stock is generally not subject to tax, 
provided that such receipt does not have the result of causing (i)&nbsp;some 
holders of such
corporation&#146;s stock or subscription rights to receive an increase in their 
proportionate interest in such corporation&#146;s assets or earnings and profits
and (ii)&nbsp;other holders of such corporation&#146;s stock or subscription 
rights to
receive cash or property within the meaning of Section&nbsp;305 of the Code. We 
intend to take the position that the distribution of the subscription rights in 
the rights offering does not have the effect of causing some holders of our 
stock or
subscription rights to receive an increase in their proportionate interest in 
our assets or our earnings and profits and other holders of our stock or 
subscription rights to receive cash or property. Under such a characterization, 
no income would be
recognized by any record date holders of our common stock in connection with the
issuance of the subscription rights pursuant to the rights offering. However, 
the application of these rules is complex and unclear, and thus counsel is not 
rendering
an opinion regarding the application of these rules. No assurance can be given 
that the IRS will not challenge this characterization, or that a court will not 
sustain such challenge. </P>

such increase in such U.S. holders&#146; proportionate interest in our assets or
our earnings and profits (a &#147;constructive distribution&#148;). Such 
constructive

current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States 
federal

current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution would be treated 
as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. holder&#146;s

its shares of our common stock and any remaining amount would be treated as

United

to federal income withholding tax at a rate of 30 percent, or at a lower rate if
an applicable income tax treaty applies. We do not intend to withhold any 
amounts on the

the rules of

NOL after an &#147;ownership change,&#148; generally a more than 50% increase in
stock ownership, measured by value, during any 3-year testing period by 5%
Shareholders. In the event of an ownership change, the amount of our NOLs that

However, under complicated rules, the amount of our stock that has been deemed 
to be acquired by 5% Shareholders will increase as a result of the issuance of 
shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights. As a
result, we
will be closer to experiencing an &#147;ownership change&#148; following the

could cause an &#147;ownership change&#148; may be increased. We intend to
