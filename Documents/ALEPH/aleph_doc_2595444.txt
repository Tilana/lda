CREDIT FACILITY
EL DORADO, Arkansas, August 10, 2016 – Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR) announced
that it has received commitments, from certain members of its existing bank group and other new
lenders to enter into a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility will be
a senior unsecured guaranteed facility and will expire in August 2019. The Company presently
expects the facility to be undrawn at closing.
“Given market conditions this new revolving facility reflects the strength of our asset base and
confidence the participating banks place in our Company,” stated Roger W. Jenkins, President
and Chief Executive Officer. “This credit facility aligns with our structure as an independent
exploration and production company and gives us ample liquidity for our long-term strategy,”
Jenkins added.

following:
•  Unsecured, with guarantees from certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries
•  Automatic reduction in facility size to a minimum of $1.0 billion should the Company
make substantial asset sales

between a range of LIBOR plus 250 basis points up to LIBOR plus 450 basis points
•  Beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2017, if the Company’s total leverage ratio
exceeds 3.25 times the Company’s trailing twelve month consolidated Adjusted
EBITDAX the facility will be required to become secured, subject to limitations set forth in
the Company’s existing notes
•  Various compliance covenants within the facility include:

Minimum Adjusted EBITDAX of 2.5 times consolidated interest expense
