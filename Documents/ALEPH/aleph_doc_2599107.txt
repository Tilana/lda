1.  Overview  
 
Eastplats is engaged in the mining and development of platinum group metals (“PGM”) deposits in South 
Africa. All of the Company’s properties are situated on the western and eastern limbs  of the Bushveld 
Complex (“BC”), the geological environment that supports over 75% of the world’s PGM production.   
As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s primary assets are:
(a)  a  87.5%  direct  and  indirect  interest  in  Barplats  Investments  Limited  (“Barplats”),  whose  main 
assets are the Crocodile River Mine (the “CRM”) located on the western limb of the BC and the 
Kennedy’s Vale project located on the eastern limb of the BC;
(b)  a 87% direct and indirect interest in the Mareesburg project, located on the eastern limb  of the
BC; and
(c)  a 93.4% direct and indirect interest in the Spitzkop project, also located on the eastern limb of the 
BC.  Kennedy’s  Vale,  Spitzkop  PGM  and  Mareesburg  projects  are  collectively  referred  as  the 
“Eastern Limb Projects”.
Due to the uncertain outlook in the global economic environment, particularly in Europe, stagnant PGM 
pricing and the operating environment in South Africa, the development of the Kennedy’s Vale project 
was  suspended  in  mid-2012,  the  Mareesburg  and  Spitzkop  PGM  project  was  suspended  in  the  fourth 
quarter of 2012, and the CRM has been placed on care and maintenance since August 1, 2013.
2.  Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights
2.1  Significant events
(cid:120)  On May 5, 2016, Ka An Development Co. Limited (“Ka An”) announced that it entered into 
a  Share Purchase  Agreement  with several shareholders,  pursuant  to  which Ka  An acquired 
ownership  and  control  of  12,777,994  common  shares  (“Common  Shares”),  representing 
approximately 13.79% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares  of the Company. On 
May 6, 2016, Ka An delivered notice to the Company and its Corporate Secretary, pursuant 
to the Company’s Advance Notice Policy, of its intention to nominate six new directors at the 
upcoming  annual  general  meeting  on  July  5,  2016  (the  “AGM”)  of  the  Company’s 
shareholders.  At  the  AGM,  Ka  An’s  nominees  were  elected  to  the  Company’s  board  of 
directors (the “Board”) and the Company underwent a change in management (collectively, 
the “Change of Control”). See also “Section 11. Subsequent Events”.
(cid:120)  On June 28, 2016,  the Company  entered a share purchase agreement  (the “CRM Purchase 
Agreement”)  with  Hebei  Zhongheng  Tianda  Platinum  Co.  Limited  (“HZT”),  a  company 
incorporated  in  People’s  Republic  of  China  (“PRC”),  whereby  HZT  will  acquire  a  100%  
equity interest in Barplats Mines Limited (“Barplats Mines”) and associated intercorporate 
investments and loans for total consideration of $50,000.  Barplats Mines is a wholly owned 
subsidiary  of  Barplats  and  holds  a  100%  interest  in  the  CRM.    The  completion  of  this
- 2 -
transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to approvals by the 
necessary regulatory bodies and governmental departments or ministries of South Africa and 
the  shareholders  of  the  Company.    Both  HZT  and  the  Company  have  agreed  that  certain 
events,  including  the  failure  to  perform  certain  obligations  under  the  CRM  Purchase 
Agreement, will trigger the payment of break fees of up to $10,000 in the case of HZT failing 
to meet its obligations, and $5,000 in the case of the Company failing to meet its obligations.  
Both HZT and the Company are required to place the break fee into an escrow account.  As at 
June  30,  2016,  the  Company  had  deposited  $5,000  in  escrow,  representing  the  break  fee 
deposit.
(cid:120)  On June 30, 2016, the former  management of the Company entered into a number  of share 
purchase  agreements  (the  “BEE  Buyout  Agreement”)  with  certain  holders’  of  its  black 
economic  empowerment  partners’  interests  in  the  Company’s  south  African  projects  to 
acquire all of its interest in the Company’s South Africa projects except for a 17.65% equity 
interest in Afriminerals Holdings (Pty) Ltd. (“Afriminerals”) for a total of $13,367.  The BEE 
Buyout Agreement provides for the buy-out of:
2.2  Financial highlights
(cid:120)  At  June 30,  2016,  the Company had a  cash position  (including  cash,  cash  equivalents  and
short term investments) of $45,831.
(cid:120)  The  Company  recorded  an  impairment  charge  of  $23,357  with  respect  to  the  CRM 
representing  a  reduction  of  net  carrying  value  of  the  CRM.    The  impairment  charge  is 
calculated  based  on  the  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell.    The  fair  value  less  cost  to  sell  was

(a)  Ingwenya
Incorporated’s
in  Gubevu 
Consortium Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd. (“Gubevu”) for a total of $8,955 and a 
18% equity interest  in Lion’s Head Platinum (Pty) Ltd. (“Lion’s Head”) for $1,099; 
and
(“Ingwenya”)  44.12%  equity
interest
(b)  Serina Service AG’s (“Serina”) 8% interest in Lion’s Head for $502, a 5.89% equity 
interest  in  Gubevu  for  $1,194  and  a  33.35%  equity  interest  of  Afriminerals  for 
$1,617.
(cid:120)  Pursuant  to  the  BEE  Buyout  Agreement,  the  Company  is  required  to  place  100%  of  the 
consideration with an  escrow agent  (the “Escrow  Agent”)  on or  before July 4, 2016.   The 
funds held in escrow will be released to Ingwenya and Serina at the closing. The closing date 
is  the  earlier  of  any  change  of  control  as  defined  in  the  BEE  Buyout  Agreement  and 
December  31, 2016.   On June 30, 2016,  the Company entered into the  escrow agreements 
with Ingwenya and Serina in accordance with the BEE Buyout Agreement.  The investigation 
includes a review of the status and validity of the share cancellations contemplated by the 
BEE Buyout Agreement.  On July 4, 2016, the Company deposited $13,367 with the Escrow 
Agent.  On July 5, 2016, the Company underwent the Change of Control and the funds held 
in escrow were automatically released on July 6, 2016.
(cid:120)  On July 24, 2016, the Company press released an update to shareholders with respect to new 
management’s  investigations  into  certain  transactions,  including  the  CRM  Purchase 
Agreement  and  the  BEE  Buyout  Agreement.  The Company  continues  to  investigate these 
transactions undertaken and disclosed by the former management of the Company and will 
update the shareholders of the Company as more details become available.
estimated to be $47,400 calculated based on the HZT’s purchase price pursuant to the CRM 
Purchase Agreement less estimated costs to sell of approximately $2,600.
(cid:120)  The Company recorded a loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company of $22,207 
($0.24 per share) in the three months ended June 30, 2016 (“Q2 2016”) compared to a loss of 
$2,666 ($0.03 per share) in the three months ended June 30, 2015 (“Q2 2015”).
(cid:120)  General  and  administrative  costs  increased  from  $492  in  Q2  2015  to  $1,010  in  Q2  2016 
resulting  from  an  increase  in shareholder  relations  costs  incurred  in Q2  2016.  These  costs 
were largely incurred by the former  management of the Company and the Board, including 
investor  relations  with  respect  to  the  AGM  and  the  proposed  change  in  the  Board  and 
management.
(cid:120)  Care and maintenance costs decreased from $2,622 in Q2 2015 to $1,455 in Q2 2016 at the
CRM and the Eastern Limb Projects, representing a 45% reduction compared to Q2 2015.

The Company’s operations are not impacted by seasonality considerations.  
 
Higher general and administrative costs in Q2 2016 were largely due to investor relations with respect to 
the AGM and the proposed changes  in the Board and management.  Higher  general and administrative 
costs in Q1 2016 were largely due to a termination payment of $1,442 (Cdn$1.98 million) made to Ian 
Rozier who stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company on January 
31, 2016.
- 4 -
Care  and  maintenance  costs  were  reduced  significantly  in  both  Q1  and  Q2  2016  as  the  Company 
continuously reduced its activities and staff after its projects were placed on care and maintenance. See 
also “Subsection 4.2. Corporate and Other Expenses”.

4.1  Crocodile River Mine 
 
The proposed sale of the CRM in connection with the CRM Purchase Agreement signed with HZT on 
June  28,  2016  remains  subject  to  approval  by  the  shareholders  of  the  Company  as  well  as  applicable 
regulatory  bodies  and  governmental  departments  or  ministries  of  South  African  authorities.  In  the 
meantime,  the  Company  is  continuing  to  meet  its  commitments  with  respect  to  its  environmental
- 6 -
management  programs  and  the  relevant  aspects  of  its  Social  and  Labour  Plan.    Care  and  maintenance 
costs are discussed under Section 4.2 hereof. 
 
In Q2 2016, the Company sold certain of its property, plant and equipment assets at the CRM and the 
Eastern Limb Projects for an overall net gain of $227.  These assets were not required during the care and 
maintenance phase.   
 
In Q2  2016,  the  Company  increased  its  environmental  guarantee issued to the  Department  of  Mineral 
Resources  of  South  Africa  by $48.    The  guarantee consists  of  money  market  fund  investments  and  is 
issued in respect of the environmental rehabilitation liability at CRM and the Eastern Limb Projects. 
 
4.2  Corporate and other expenses 
 
The Company’s presentation function is the U.S. dollar (“$”) while the Company’s operating expenses 
are  incurred  in  Canadian  dollars  (“Cdn$”)  or  South  African  Rand  (“ZAR”).    The  average  of  foreign 
exchange rate is Cdn$1.00 to $0.7763 and ZAR1.00 to $0.0668 for Q2 2016 and Cdn$1.00 to $ 0.8136 
and ZAR1.00 to $0.0828 for Q2 2015. 
 
General and administrative 
 
General  and  administrative  expenses  (“G&A”)  are  costs  associated  with  the  Company’s  Vancouver 
corporate head office and include legal and accounting, regulatory, executive management fees, investor 
relations, travel and consulting fees.  Such costs are incurred in Canadian dollars.   
 
G&A increased to  $1,010 and $2,917  for  the three and six  months  ended June 30, 2016,  respectively, 
compared  to  $492  and  $1,130  for  the  same  period  in  2015.    The  increase  is  due  to  the  increase  of 
shareholder relations costs in Q2 2016 and a termination payment of $1,442 (Cdn$1.98 million) made to 
Ian Rozier who stepped down as President and CEO of the Company on January 31, 2016.    
 
Care and maintenance, and care and maintenance depreciation 
 
Care and maintenance costs  were incurred when the Company suspended production for  a project and 
reduced its expenditures to the minimum required to maintain the assets in good condition.    Such costs 
consist of maintenance, pumping to prevent flooding of the workings, underground inspections to ensure 
that the integrity of critical excavations is preserved, general and administrative expenses and other costs 
necessary  to  safeguard  the  assets  of  the  project.    The  Company’s  Mareesburg  and  Kennedy’s  Vale 
concentrator project was placed on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the CRM was 
placed on care and maintenance in the third  quarter  of 2013.  Quarterly costs have generally remained 
consistent since these projects were placed into care and maintenance. 
 
On  January  31,  2016,  the  Company  reduced  its  care  and  maintenance  workforce  at  the  CRM  and  the 
Eastern Limb Projects by approximately 34% and incurred termination costs of $303.  However, overall 
care and maintenance costs decreased to $1,455 and $3,306 for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2016, respectively, compared to $2,622 and $4,958 for the same period in 2015, representing a decrease 
of 45% and 33% respectively.   
   
Care and maintenance depreciation consists of the depreciation expense related to assets belonging to a 
project that is currently on care and maintenance.  Care and maintenance depreciation decreased to $122 
and $196 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $411 and $920 for 
the same period in 2015. The decrease primarily resulted from the fact that the refining contract was fully 
amortized by the end of the second quarter of 2015.
- 7 -
Impairment 
 
The sale of the CRM, although closing of this transaction is subject to certain conditions, represented an 
impairment indicator. Therefore, the Company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $23,357 
in Q2 2016 based on HZT’s purchase price, less estimated costs to sell of approximately $2,600.  There 
was no such impairment charge in Q1 2016 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. 
 
Interest income 
 
Interest  income  decreased  to  $214  and  $415  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016, 
respectively,  compared  to  $313  and  $695  for  the  same  period  in  2015.    The  decrease  is  due  to  the 
Company’s  lower  cash  balances  over  the  respective  quarters  as  a  result  of  cash  spent  on  care  and 
maintenance and general and administrative over the last 12 months and due to a weaker Canadian dollar 
versus the U.S. dollar compared to the same period in 2015.            
 
Other income 
 
Other income consists of rental income from company-owned residential properties on the Eastern Limb 
Projects  and  at  the  CRM  as  well  as  other  types  of  income  not  directly  related  to  operations.    The  
Company recorded other  income of $391 and $856 for  the three and six  months  ended June 30, 2016, 
respectively, compared to $355 and $943 for the same period in 2015.     
 
Finance costs 
 
The Company recorded finance costs of $161 and $316 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 
respectively,  compared to  $257  and  $449  for  the  same period  in 2015.    Finance costs  include  interest 
accretion  on  the  provision  for  environmental  rehabilitation  and  miscellaneous  interest  charges.    As 
finance costs are mostly incurred in South African Rand, the weakening of the Rand during the three and 
six  months  ended  June 30,  2016  has  led to a  decrease  in  finance  costs  reported in  U.S.  dollars  in the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
 
Income tax 
 
The Company recorded a net income tax expense of $55 and a net income tax recovery of $153 for the 
three and six months end June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to a net income tax recovery of $39 and a 
net income tax expense of $22 for the same period in 2015.  In Q1 2016, the Company reversed a $227 
over accrual of taxes payable following the settlement of some long-term outstanding tax issues in South 
Africa.    Excluding  the  over  accrual,  the Company recorded  an  income  tax  expense  of  $74  for  the  six 
months ended June 30, 2016.  The expense relates to the origination and reversal of temporary differences 
which arose due to changes in the Company’s net assets and the foreign exchange impact on the deferred 
tax  liabilities.    The consolidated statement  of  financial position reflects  total  deferred tax  liabilities  of 
$2,679  which  arose primarily  as  a  result  of  the step-up  to  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  acquired  on  the 
Spitzkop and Mareesburg business acquisitions in prior years.
5.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
At June 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $52,453 (December 31, 2015 – $55,716) and cash 
and cash  equivalents and short-term investments  of $45,831 (December  31, 2015 – $56,334) in highly 
liquid, fully guaranteed, bank sponsored instruments.
- 8 -
Cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  decreased  by  $6,867  in  Q2  2016  compared  to  the 
balance as at March 31, 2016 as the Company used approximately $2,100 cash in operations, including 
G&A and care and maintenance of the CRM and the Eastern Limb Projects, and transferred $5,000 to an 
escrow account for the HZT break fee deposit, which were partially offset by interest, other income and 
proceeds from asset sales of approximately $400. 
 
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $10,503 for the six months ended June 30, 
2016 compared to the balance as at December 31, 2015 as the Company incurred approximately $5,806 
cash expense in operations including G&A and care and maintenance of the CRM and the Eastern Limb 
Projects, incurred expenditures of $0.4  million on property, plant and equipment and other  assets,  paid 
taxes of $1,587 and transferred $5,000 to an escrow account for the HZT break fee deposit, which were 
partially offset by interest, other income and proceeds from asset sales of approximately $1,000. 
 
The  Company  had  no  long-term  debt  outstanding  at  June  30,  2016,  other  than  a  provision  for 
environmental rehabilitation relating to the CRM, Kennedy’s Vale and Spitzkop.   
 
5.1  Outlook 
 
The  proposed  sale  of  the  CRM  and  the  related  buy-out  of  the  BEE  Partners’  minority  interest  in  the  
Company’s South African assets by the former  management have dramatically changed the Company’s 
strategic footprint  in the area. The new  management  and  Board continue to review  the CRM  Purchase 
Agreement, the BEE Buyout Agreement, the payment to certain minority interest holders and all related 
transactions conducted by the former management of the Company and will adopt a new strategy based 
on the outcome of this review. 
 
Due to the buy-out  of  the  BEE  Partners’  minority  interest,  the Company  is  currently  in  breach  of  the 
provisions  of  all  of  its  mining  rights  and  certain  provisions  of  the  Mineral  &  Petroleum  Resources 
Development  Act  (Republic  of  South  Africa)  (“MPRDA”).  Under  section  93  of  the  MPRDA,  the 
Department  of  Mineral  Resources  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  (“DMR”)  may  formally  order  the  
Company to rectify this non-compliance. Failure to rectify the non-compliance will ultimately lead to the 
Minister  cancelling the Company’s  mining rights under  section 47 of the MPRDA.  The Company has 
met  with  DMR  and  is  working  proactively  to  introduce  another  BEE  partner  into  the  Company’s 
activities. 
 
While the Company is still in the process of reviewing its strategic plan, the Company believes that, given 
the  continued  stagnation  of  the  global  economy  and  the  European  car  market,  which  consumes 
approximately 50%  of  South  Africa’s  platinum production,  the industry  would  have to contend  with a 
continuation of stagnant PGM prices which are hovering near 10-year lows, despite indications of some 
meaningful production cuts from the larger PGM producers.  At the same time, the South African PGM 
industry  continues  to  experience  a  number  of  adverse  economic  factors,  particularly  ongoing  labour 
unrest,  operating  cost  inflation,  and  concerns  with  respect  to  reliable  power  delivery.    Ongoing  cost 
pressure and decreasing productivity in South Africa will continue to significantly reduce free cash flow 
for the industry.  Should there be a sustained strengthening of PGM prices and marked improvement in 
the  operating  environment  in  South  Africa,  the  Company  believes  it  currently  has  sufficient  cash 
resources to react quickly and ramp up activities at the CRM.  
 
Subject  to  adequate  funding  being  available,  development  of  the  Mareesburg  open  pit  mine  and 
Kennedy’s  Vale  concentrator  project,  which  was  suspended  in  mid-2012,  may  also  be  restarted  once 
market and operating conditions support such recommencement.  At present the Company does not have 
sufficient  funds  in  the  form  of  cash  and  short-term  investments  to  complete  the  development  and 
construction of the open-pit mine and concentrator if the project is restarted.
- 9 -
Additional  funding  will  be  required  to  bring  the  project  into  production,  and  to  bring  the  rest  of  the 
Eastern Limb Projects (including Spitzkop and Kennedy’s Vale) into production, and such funding may 
include  a  financing  package,  joint  venture  or  other  third  party  participation  in  one  or  more  of  these 
projects,  or  the  public  or  private  sales  of  equity  or  debt  securities  of  the  Company.    Any  additional 
financing may be dilutive to shareholders,  and debt financing, if available,  may involve restrictions on 
financing, investing and operating activities.  There can be no assurance that additional funding will be 
available to the Company when needed or, if available, that this funding will be on acceptable terms.  If 
adequate funds are not available, including funds generated from any producing operations, the Company 
may be required to further delay or reduce the scope of these development projects or mining operations. 
 
5.2   Impairment 
 
The  Company  assesses  the  carrying  values  of  its  mineral  properties  for  indication  or  reversal  of  
impairment  at  the  end  of  each quarter.    For the purposes  of  the  impairment  assessment,  the  Company 
identified the CRM as one cash-generating unit (“CGU”) and the Eastern Limb Projects as one CGU. 
 
As  discussed  above,  although  the  closing  of  the  transaction  contemplated  in  the  CRM  Purchase 
Agreement is subject to certain conditions, the Company considered that the sale of the CRM represented 
an impairment indicator.  HZT’s purchase price in the amount of $50,000 less the costs to sell (estimated 
to  be  $2,600)  represents  the  net  proceeds  from selling  Barplats  Mines.  The  excess  amount  of  the  net 
carrying  value  of  Barplats  Mines  over  the  net  proceeds  in the  amount  of  $23,357  was  recorded as  an 
impairment change towards the CRM.  
 
With respect to the Eastern Limb Projects, the Company has determined that there were no impairment 
indicators as at June 30, 2016. 
 
Any  changes  to  future  market  conditions  and  commodity  prices  may  result  in  impairment,  a  further 
impairment or a reversal of impairment of any of the Company’s mineral properties.       
 
5.3  Share capital 
 
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company did not issue any Common Shares or 
grant any stock options.  66,000 stock options expired during the three and six months ended June 30, 
2016.  There was no share-based payment expense recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2016 and 2015.   
 
As at the date of this MD&A, the Company had:
(cid:120)  92,639,032 Common Shares outstanding; 
(cid:120)  39,722 treasury shares outstanding; and

On January 31, 2016, Ian Rozier  stepped down as  the President  and CEO  of  the Company and David 
Cohen, the then Chairman of the Company, assumed the role of President and CEO until July 5, 2016.  
Mr.  Rozier’s  services  were  provided  pursuant  to  a  management  services  contract  with  Buccaneer,  a 
private  company  controlled  by  Mr.  Rozier.    In  accordance  with  the  contract,  Buccaneer  was  paid  a 
termination amount of $1,442 (Cdn$1.98 million) on January 31, 2016.  Mr. Rozier remained a director of 
the Company until July 5, 2016. 
 
Management  and  consulting  fees  decreased  to  $138  in  Q2  2016  compared  to  $235  in  Q2  2015,  and 
increased to $1,735 for  the six  months  ended June 30, 2016 compared to $463  for  the same period in 
2015.  The increase was a result of the inclusion of the termination payment referred to above. Excluding 
this payment, management and consulting fees were reduced to $293 for the six months ended June 30, 
2016. 
 
There  were no share-based payments  paid  to  key  management  personnel for  the three and six  months 
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.    
 
At June 30, 2016, the Company held a loan receivable from Gubevu in the amount of ZAR 761 million 
($51,869) (December 31, 2015 – ZAR 726 million, $46,972), which has been fully provided for in the 
consolidated financial statements.  The Company did not record any interest income with regards to this 
loan or receive cash from, or lend any further cash to Gubevu in the three and six months ended June 30, 
2016 and 2015.  
 
Accounts payable at June 30, 2016 included $nil (December 31, 2015 - $13) due to private companies 
controlled by officers and directors of the Company. Amounts due to related parties are unsecured, non-
interest bearing and due on demand.   
 
Accounts  receivable  at  June  30,  2016  included  $39  (December  31,  2015  -  $31)  due  from  Remington 
which reimburses the Company for certain general and administrative expenses incurred by the Company 
on behalf of Remington.  
 
All  related  party  transactions  were  recorded  at  the  amounts  agreed  upon  between  the  parties.    Any 
balances payable are payable on demand without interest.
7.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
 
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  policies  and  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  and 
revenue and expenses.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and
- 12 -
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the  basis  of  making  the  judgments  about  carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily 
apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from those estimates as the estimation process is 
inherently uncertain. Estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other 
factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and the resulting 
impact on the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities are accounted for prospectively. 
 
Areas of significant  judgment and estimates  made by management  for the three and six  months  ended 
June 30, 2016 includes determination whether selling the CRM is considered to be an asset held for sale 
in accordance with IFRS 5.  Additional critical judgments and estimates applied in the preparation of the 
Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months 
ended  June  30,  2016  are  consistent  with  those  applied  and  disclosed  in  notes  4(w)  and  4(x)  of  the 
Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2015  as 
summarized below.  
 
Critical  accounting  estimates  are  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by  management  that  may  result  in 
material adjustments to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
(i)
Impairment
The  Company’s  tangible  and  intangible  assets  are  reviewed  for  indications  of  impairment  at  each 
statement of financial position date. If indication of impairment exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. 
 
An  impairment  loss  is  recognized  when  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset,  or  its  cash-generating  unit, 
exceeds  its recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generates  cash inflows that are largely independent  of the cash inflows  from other assets  or groups  of 
assets. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss for the period.  
 
Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the 
other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.  
 
The  recoverable  amount  is  the  greater  of  the  asset’s  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  value  in  use.  In  
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount 
is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
The  Company  considers  the  NPV  valuation  to  be  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  For  the  purposes  of  the  
valuation, the Company identified CRM as one cash-generating unit and the Spitzkop, Mareesburg and 
Kennedy’s Vale projects (collectively the “Eastern Limb” projects) as one cash-generating unit. There has 
been no change to the composition of CGUs compared to the prior year.
- 13 -
(ii)
Rehabilitation Provision
The future value of the provision for environmental rehabilitation was determined using an inflation rate 
of  6.67%  (December  31,  2015  –  6.67%)  and  an  estimated  life  of  mine  of  16  years  for  Zandfontein 
(December 31, 2015 – 16 years), eight years for Maroelabult (December 31, 2015 – 8 years), ten years for 
Crocette (December 31, 2015 – 10 years), 23 years for Kennedy’s Vale (December 31, 2015 – 23 years) 
and 23 years for Spitzkop (December 31, 2015 – 23 years). The provision has been discounted to present 
value at a discount rate of 9.43% (December 31, 2015 – 9.43%).   Zandforntein, Maroelabult and Crocette 
collectively referred as CRM.
Critical Accounting Judgments
(i)
Determination of Functional Currency
Critical  accounting  judgments  are  accounting  policies  that  have  been  identified  as  being  complex  or 
involving subjective judgments or assessments.
In accordance with IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, management determined 
that  the  functional  currencies  of  Eastern  Platinum  Limited  and  its  South  African  subsidiaries  are  the 
Canadian  Dollar  and  South  African  Rand  (“ZAR”),  respectively,  as  these  are  the  currencies  of  the 
primary economic environment in which the companies operate.
At  December  31,  2015  the remaining  life  of  mine  for  Zandfontein,  Maroelabult,  Crocette,  Kennedy’s 
Vale and Spitzkop was assessed at 16 years, eight years, ten years, 23 years and 23 years, respectively 
based on proven and probable ore reserves. The change in remaining mine life will be evaluated each year 
as the reserves move to the proven and probable category.

Fair value of financial instruments 
 
The fair  value of financial instruments traded in active markets  is based on quoted market prices at the 
balance sheet date.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, other assets and trade 
and other payables approximate their carrying values due to the short-term to maturities of these financial 
instruments. 
 
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into a 
hierarchy based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.  Level 1 fair value measurements are 
derived from unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 fair 
value measurements are derived from  inputs  other than quoted prices  included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability directly or indirectly.  Level 3 fair value measurements are derived 
from valuation techniques that include inputs for  the asset or liability that  are not based on observable
- 15 -
market data.  At June 30, 2016, there were no financial assets or liabilities recognized at fair value on a 
non-recurring basis.
9.  New Accounting Standards and Accounting Pronouncements Under IFRS

Board comprised of  George G. Dorin, (chairman),  Peter M. Clausi,  Michael Cosic,  Douglas G. 
Perkins, George Pire and Sam Wang.
(cid:120)  On July 5, 2016, Sterling, Maluti and Jazz terminated their services with the Company as a result 
of the Change of Control of the Board and management and were paid a termination fee totalling 
$1,231 (Cdn$1.59 million) by the Company.
(cid:120)  On July 5, 2016, the Company granted 600,000 stock options to the New Directors at an exercise 
price of $1.05 per share.  These stock options vest 90 days from the grant date and expire on July

Company (the “Acquisition”). As a result of the Acquisition, Ka An owns approximately 23.89% 
of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares.
12. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
Disclosure controls and procedures 
 
The Company’s management  has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and 
procedures. Based upon the results of that evaluation, the Company’s management has concluded that, as 
of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in 
reports it files is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the appropriate time periods and is
- 17 -
accumulated  and  communicated  to  management,  including  the  CEO  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer 
(“CFO”) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
Internal control over financial reporting  
 
The CEO and the CFO are also responsible for the design of the internal controls over financial reporting 
(“ICFR”)  within  the  Company  in  order  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for  external purposes  in accordance  with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).   
 
There have been no changes in the Company’s ICFR during the six months ended June 30, 2016 that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR. 
 
Limitation of controls and procedures 
 
The Company’s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over 
financial  reporting,  no  matter  how  well  conceived  and  operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not 
absolute,  assurance  that  the  objectives  of  the control  system  are  met.  Further,  the  design  of  a  control 
system  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints,  and  the  benefits  of  controls  must  be  
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot 
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have 
been  prevented  or  detected.  These inherent  limitations  include  the realities  that  judgments  in  decision 
making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur  because of simple error  or  mistake.  Additionally, 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, 
or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any control system also is based in part upon 
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design 
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of 
the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur 
and not be detected.
13. Risk Factors  
 
The exploration of mineral deposits involves significant risks and uncertainties. A comprehensive list of 
risk  factors  relating  to  our  business  is  provided  under  the  heading  “Risk  Factors”,  in  the  Company’s 
annual  information  form  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2015,  which  is  available  on  SEDAR,  at 
www.sedar.com.  Certain  of  the  more  prominent  risk  factors  that  may  materially  affect  the  Company’s 
future performance, in addition to those referred to above, are listed hereunder. 
 
Titles  and  other  rights  to  the  Company’s  assets  cannot  be  guaranteed  and  may  be  subject  to  prior 
unregistered agreements, transfers or claims and other defects. 
 
The Company cannot guarantee that  title to its  mineral property will not be challenged. The Company 
may  not  have,  or  may  not  be able to  obtain,  all  necessary  surface rights  to  develop  its  projects.  Title 
insurance generally is not available for mineral properties, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained 
secure  claim  to  individual  mineral  properties  or  mining  concessions  comprising  the  projects  may  be 
severely constrained. The mineral property may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or 
claims,  and  title  may  be affected by,  among  other  things,  undetected  defects.  We  have  not  conducted 
surveys of all of the claims  in which we hold direct or indirect interests. A successful challenge to the 
precise area and location of these claims could result in our being unable to operate on all or part of the 
property as permitted or being unable to enforce our rights with respect to all or part of the property. This 
could  result  in  Eastplats  not  being  compensated  for  its  prior  expenditures  relating  to  the  property.  In
- 18 -
addition, Eastplats' ability to continue to explore and develop the property may be subject to agreements 
with other third parties. 
 
Buy-out of certain holders’ of BEE Partners’ minority interest may cause the Company to lose its mining 
licence or negatively impact the Company’s ability to operate or sell the property in the future.  
 
The Company currently does not have a BEE partner and is in breach of the provisions of all of its mining 
rights and certain provisions of the MPRDA. Although the Company is working proactively to look for a 
new BEE partner, there is no guarantee that the Company can successfully find a BEE partner within the 
required timeframe. The Company’s operations and value of assets may be negatively impacted due to the 
lack of a BEE partner. 
 
Suppliers suspending or denying delivery of products or services.  
 
Eastplats’ business and technology systems and platforms depend on products and services provided by 
third parties including contractors, surveyors and consultants. If there is any interruption to products or 
services provided by third parties or those products or services are not as adaptable to Eastplats’ needs as 
anticipated,  or  there  are  problems  in  upgrading  such  products  or  services,  Eastplats’  business  may  be 
adversely affected, and Eastplats may be unable to fund adequate replacement products or services on a 
timely basis or at all. 
 
Eastplats’ activities are subject to changes in government legislation, taxation, controls, regulations and 
political or economic developments in Canada,  the United States, South Africa, or Barbados or  other 
countries in which Eastplats carries or may carry on business in the future, that may increase Eastplats’ 
costs of doing business and restrict the Company’s operations.  
 
The  current  mining,  exploration  and  development  activities  of  Eastplats  require  permits  from  various 
governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations regarding 
prospecting,  labour  standards,  occupational  health,  waste  disposal,  toxic  substances,  land  use, 
environmental protection, safety and other matters. Companies engaged in exploration activities generally 
experience increased costs and delays as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations 
and  to  obtain  permits.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  all  permits  which  Eastplats  may  require  for 
exploration will be obtainable on reasonable terms or on a timely basis, or that such laws and regulations 
would not have a materially adverse effect on any project that Eastplats may undertake.  
 
Failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  permitting  requirements  may  result  in 
enforcement  actions,  including  but  not  limited  to  orders  issued  by  regulatory  or  judicial  authorities 
causing  operations  to  cease  or  to  be  curtailed,  and  may  include  corrective  measures  requiring  capital 
expenditures,  installation  of  additional  equipment,  or  remedial  actions.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that 
compliance  with  these  laws  and  regulations  or  changes  thereto  or  the  cost  of  rehabilitation  of  site 
operations or the failure to obtain necessary permits, approvals or  leases or successful challenges to the 
grant  of  such  permits,  approvals  and  leases  will  not  adversely  affect  the  results  of  operations  or  the 
financial condition of Eastplats. Parties engaged in exploration operations may be required to compensate 
those suffering loss or damage by reason of the exploration activities and may have civil or criminal fines 
or  penalties  imposed  for  violations  of  applicable  laws  or  regulations  and,  in  particular,  environmental 
laws. 
 
Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration 
companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on Eastplats 
and cause increases in expenditure and costs, or require abandonment, or cause delays in developing new 
mining properties.
- 19 -
Eastplats may have difficulty obtaining additional funding. 
 
As  a  result  of  Eastplats’  decision  to suspend  funding  for  the  project,  the  Company  terminated certain 
facilities agreements that were to be used to partly fund the development costs of the project. Eastplats 
and  the  banks  agreed  to  investigate  the  restructuring  of  the  financing  package  when  the  project  is 
restarted. There is no assurance that a restructuring of the financing package will be available to Eastplats 
or, if available, that this funding will be on acceptable terms. 
 
Additional  funding  will  be  required  to  bring  the  project  into  production,  and  to  bring  the  rest  of  the 
Eastern Limb Projects (including Spitzkop and Kennedy’s Vale) into production, and such funding may 
include a restructuring of Eastplats’ financing. Any additional financing may be dilutive to shareholders, 
and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictions on financing, investing and operating activities. 
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  additional  funding  will  be  available  to  Eastplats  when  needed  or,  if 
available,  that  this  funding  will be  on acceptable terms.  If  adequate funds  are  not  available,  including 
funds generated from any producing operations, Eastplats may be required to delay or reduce the scope of 
these development projects or mining operations. 
 
The trading market for the common shares may be subject to volatility. 
 
The market price of the common shares may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, 
including  variations  in  the operating results  of  Eastplats,  divergence in financial results  from analysts’ 
expectations,  changes  in  earnings  estimates  by  stock  market  analysts,  general  economic  conditions, 
legislative changes in Eastplats’ sector and other events and factors outside the control of Eastplats.  
 
In addition, stock markets, and in particular the market for shares of resource companies, have from time 
to  time  experienced  extreme  price  and  volume  fluctuations  which,  as  well  as  general  economic  and 
political conditions, could adversely affect the market price for Eastplats’ common shares. 
 
Eastplats is susceptible to the risks of currency fluctuation that directly impact the Company, such as the 
Canadian dollar, South African Rand and U.S. dollar. 
 
Prior to the suspension of Eastplats’ South African mining and development activities in 2012 and 2013, 
operations  at  the  CRM  were  predominantly  conducted  in  Rand,  with  costs  paid  in  Rand  and  revenues 
received in Rand, even though PGM prices were based in U.S. dollars. Development costs at Eastplats’ 
Eastern Limb Projects were also predominantly in Rand. Eastplats did not and has no plans to hedge or 
sell forward any of  its PGM production and would therefore be exposed to  exchange rate fluctuations 
should the CRM production and the Eastern Limb development resume. As Eastplats also has not and has 
no plans to purchase any forward currency exchange contracts, a deterioration of the U.S. and Canadian 
dollar  against  the  Rand  could  increase  the  cost  of  PGM  production  and  the  cost  of  the  Eastern  Limb  
development  and  therefore  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  earnings  of  the  CRM  when 
operations resume, and on the overall costs of bringing the Eastern Limb into production.  
 
Eastplats cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results and there 
can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on its business, 
operating results or financial condition. 
 
Eastplats is exposed to the risks associated with fluctuations in the assumed prices of PGMs and other 
commodities. 
 
Metal prices have a direct impact on Eastplats’ decision to resume operations at the CRM and to reinitiate 
development  at  the  Eastern  Limb,  and  on  Eastplats’  earnings  should  production  at  the  CRM  resume. 
Since  late 2011,  demand  and  industrial  consumption  of  platinum  has  been  negatively  impacted by the
- 20 -
volatility of the Eurozone financial markets, by the global economy in general, and more recently by the 
strength in the U.S. dollar and the weakening of gold prices. Supplies have been negatively affected by 
the depletion of existing resources and the lack of new mining projects, and by intermittent production 
stoppages  experienced  by  many  of  the  South  African  PGM  miners.  This  has  resulted  in  a  significant 
increase in the recycling of scrap. Some of the other key factors that may influence platinum prices are 
policies  in  the  most  important  producing  countries,  namely  South  Africa  and  Russia,  the  amount  of 
stockpiled platinum, economic conditions in the main consuming countries, international economic and 
political trends, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, and inflation. A decline 
in the market price of PGMs mined by Eastplats may render ore reserves containing relatively low grades 
of mineralization uneconomic and may in certain circumstances lead to a restatement of reserves. 
 
Since  late 2011, PGM prices  have  generally  declined with occasional periods  of high volatility  due to 
unplanned  and  unlawful  labour  actions  experienced  by  the  South  African  PGM  industry.  There  is  no 
assurance that PGM prices will return to the 2008 highs (when platinum reached $2,200 per ounce) in the 
future, or to levels  which would result in a positive decision to restart mining at the CRM in the near 
future. 
 
Eastplats may incur unexpected costs from litigation. 
 
Eastplats  is  or  may  be  subject  to  legal  proceedings  related  to  the  development  of  its  projects,  its 
operations, titles to it properties, environmental issues and shareholder or other investor lawsuits. Given 
the uncertain nature of these actions and the recent significant change in management, despite Eastplats’ 
diligence  in  obtaining  information  and  investigating  the  actions  of  the  former  management  of  the 
Company, Eastplats cannot reasonably predict the outcome thereof. The Company may face lawsuits due 
to its operations and if Eastplats is unable to win or favourably settle any lawsuits, it may have a material 
adverse effect on Eastplats.  
 
Eastplats is prone to the risks associated with mining or development activities and the speculative nature 
of  exploration  and  development,  including  the  risk  of  obtaining  necessary  licenses  and  permits  and 
assumed quantities or grades of reserves. 
 
Eastplats’  exploration  and  mining  activities  are  dependent  upon  the  grant  of  appropriate  licences, 
concessions, leases, permits and regulatory consents which may be granted for a defined period of time, 
or may not be granted, or may be withdrawn or made subject to limitations. There can be no assurance 
that  such authorizations  will be renewed following  expiry  or  granted (as  the case may be)  or  as  to the 
terms  of  such  grants  or  renewals.  There  is  also  no  assurance  that  the  issue  of  a  reconnaissance, 
prospecting or exploration licence will ensure the subsequent issue of a mining licence. 
 
The business of exploring for minerals and mining involves a high degree of risk. Only a small proportion 
of  the  properties  that  are  explored  are  ultimately  developed  into  producing  mines.  The  mining  areas 
presently being assessed by Eastplats may not contain economically recoverable volumes of minerals or 
metals. The operations of Eastplats may be disrupted by a variety of factors and hazards which are beyond 
the control of Eastplats, including but not limited to geological and geotechnical uncertainties, seismic 
events,  fires,  power  outages,  labour  disruptions,  flooding,  explosions,  cave-ins,  landslides,  and  the 
inability  to  obtain  suitable  or  adequate  machinery,  industrial  and  mechanical  accidents,  equipment  or 
labour  difficulties,  environmental  events  (including  discharge  of  metals,  pollutants  or  hazardous 
chemicals) and other risks involved in the operation of mines and the conduct of exploration programs. 
 
There  is  uncertainty  associated  with  Eastplats’  operating  assumptions,  many  of  which  are  outside 
Eastplats’ control, and therefore Eastplats’ results may differ materially from those forecast. Eastplats has 
relied,  and  may  continue  to  rely,  upon  consultants  and  others  for  operating  expertise.  Should 
economically recoverable volumes of minerals or metal be identified, it can take a number of years from
- 21 -
the initial phases of drilling and identification of mineralization until production is possible. During this 
time, the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditure is required to establish 
reserves through drilling, to develop metallurgical processes, and to develop the mining and processing 
facilities and infrastructure at any site selected for mining. Although substantial benefits may be derived 
from the discovery of a major mineral deposit, no assurance can be given that minerals will be discovered 
in sufficient quantities or have sufficient grade to justify commercial operations, or that funds required for 
development can be obtained on a timely basis. 
 
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  minerals  recovered  in  laboratory  test  work  will  be  recoverable 
economically in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale operations, and material 
changes  in  geological  resources,  grades,  stripping  ratios  or  recovery  rates  may  affect  the  economic 
viability of projects.
14. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information  
 
This  MD&A  contains  certain  “forward-looking  statements”  or  “forward-looking 
information” 
(collectively  referred  to  herein  as  “forward-looking  statements”)  within  the  meaning  of  applicable 
securities  legislation. Such forward-looking statements include,  without  limitation, forecasts, estimates, 
expectations and objectives for future operations that are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and

expressions,  or  are  events  or  conditions  that  “will”,  “would”,  “may”,  “could”  or  “should”  occur  or  be 
achieved.  This  MD&A  contains  forward-looking  statements,  pertaining  to,  among  other  things,  the 
following:  the  future  funding  of  the  Company’s  projects,  the  future  development  of  the  Company’s 
projects,  the  Company’s  plans  for  its  properties,  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  meet  all  of  its 
commitments  with  respect  to  its  environmental  management  programs  and  the  relevant  aspects  of  its 
Social and Labour Plan, the continual review of the CRM Purchase Agreement, BEE Buyout Agreement, 
payment to certain holders of minority interests and all related transactions by current management and 
the  adoption  of  a  new  strategy  based  on  the  outcome  of  this  review,  the  Company’s  belief  that  the 
platinum production  industry  will  have  to  face a  continuation  of  stagnant  PGM  prices,  the  continuing 
impact of adverse economic factors on the South African PGM industry, the assertion that ongoing cost 
pressure and decreasing productivity in South Africa will continue to reduce free cash flow for the PGM 
industry, the Company’s belief that it currently has sufficient cash resources to ramp up production at the 
CRM if there is a sustained strengthening of PGM prices and a marked improvement in the South African 
operating environment, the possibility of restarting the development of the Mareesburg open pit mine and 
Kennedy’s Vale concentrator projects, the insufficiency of adequate funding when the project is restarted, 
the requirement of additional funding to bring the project into production and how that funding will be 
attained, the possibility of any impairment  or reversal of impairment  if there are any changes to future 
market conditions and commodity prices and the possibility that the Company may attempt to issue new 
shares to maintain or adjust the capital structure.   
 
With  respect  to  forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  MD&A,  assumptions  have  been  made 
regarding, among other things, the completion, timing, and potential benefits of the proposed transaction 
between  the  Company  and  HZT,  the  price  of  PGMs,  fluctuations  in  currency  markets,  inflation,  the 
regulatory framework in the jurisdictions in which the Company conducts its business,  operating costs, 
the Company’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and litigation. 
 
Forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  all  of  the  risks  and  uncertainties  normally  incident  in  the 
mining and development of PGMs that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those 
anticipated  in  such  forward-looking  statements.  These  risks  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  risk  of 
fluctuations in the assumed exchange rates of currencies that directly impact the Company, such as the
- 22 -
Canadian  dollar,  South  African Rand and  U.S.  dollar, the risk  of  fluctuations  in the assumed prices  of 
PGM and other commodities, the risk of changes in government legislation, taxation, controls, regulations 
and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, South Africa, or Barbados or other 
countries  in  which  the  Company  carries  or  may  carry  on  business  in  the  future,  risks  associated  with 
mining or development activities, the speculative nature of exploration and development, including the 
risk  of  obtaining  necessary  licenses  and  permits,  assumed  quantities  or  grades  of  reserves  and  certain 
other  known  and  unknown  risks  detailed  from  time  to  time  in  the  Company’s  public  disclosure 
documents, copies of which are available on the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.
