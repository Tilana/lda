NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Description of Business
Mewbourne Energy Partners 09-A, L.P., (the “Registrant” or the “Partnership”), a Delaware
limited partnership engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in Texas,
Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on February 26, 2009. The offering of limited
and general partner interests began May 1, 2009 as a part of a private placement pursuant
to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D promulgated thereunder,
and concluded August 28, 2009, with total investor contributions of $66,210,000 originally
being sold to accredited investors of which $62,140,000 were sold to accredited investors
as general partner interests and $4,070,000 were sold to accredited investors as limited
partner interests. During 2011, all general partner equity interests were converted to
limited partner equity interests. In accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
Mewbourne Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation, has been
appointed as the Partnership’s managing general partner. MD has no significant equity
interest in the Partnership.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Reference is hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2015, which
contains a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Partnership in the
preparation of its financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing the
quarterly report included herein.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain
all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present fairly our financial
position, results of operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods presented.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the final
results expected for the full year.
3. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities
The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities.
Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization
is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying
the oil and gas properties. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, all capitalized costs were subject to
amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the
full cost pool. Gains and losses are not recognized unless such adjustments would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to
the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net cash flows of proved reserves,
computed using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month oil and
natural gas prices, discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved
properties. If unamortized costs capitalized exceed the ceiling, the excess is charged to
expense in the period the excess occurs. There were cost ceiling write-downs totaling
$991,101 and $10,462,723 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
7
4. Asset Retirement Obligations
The Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future plugging and
abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and
abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the
time a new well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated with estimated plugging and
abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.
The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment costs based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-
adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well
plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact
new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in
connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well.
A reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:
Balance, beginning of period
Liabilities incurred
Liabilities reduced due to settlements and sales of property   (91

5. Related Party Transactions
In accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne Development
Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Partnership’s
managing general partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the
Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all
transactions are with MD and MOC.
In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to
owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The Partnership will receive their
portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and
gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate
overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Services
and operator charges are billed in accordance with the program and partnership
agreements.
In accordance with the Partnership agreement, during any particular calendar year the
total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not
exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s gross revenue from the sale of oil and
natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital
contributions of limited and general partners.
8
The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through the Program. The Partnership
and MD are the parties to the Program, and the costs and revenues are allocated between
them as follows:
Revenues:
Proceeds from disposition of depreciable and depletable properties
All other revenues
Costs and expenses:
Organization and offering costs (1)
Lease acquisition costs (1)
Tangible and intangible drilling costs (1)
Operating costs, reporting and legal expenses, general and administrative
expenses and all other costs

(1)
As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and
offering costs and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 15% of total capital costs.
To the extent that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than
15% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the
Program’s total capital costs reaches approximately 15%. The Partnership’s financial
statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.
Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Mewbourne Energy Partners 09-A, L.P. (“the Partnership”) was formed February 26, 2009.
The offering of limited and general partnership interests began May 1, 2009 and concluded
August 28, 2009, with total investor contributions of $66,210,000. During 2011, all general
partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity interests.
Future capital requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds
generated from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is anticipated. The Partnership
had net working capital of $310,765 at June 30, 2016.
The Partnership had reduced cash flows from operations for the six months ended June
30, 2016 due to the steep decline in oil and gas prices during the previous twelve months.
Considering these reduced operating cashflows, the Partnership anticipates smaller
distributions until prices improve.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership made cash distributions to
the investor partners in the amount of $362,017 as compared to $891,411 for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. Since inception, the Partnership has made distributions of
$67,981,641, inclusive of state tax payments.
The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be affected by a
number of factors that are beyond the Partnership’s control. These factors include the
price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these
products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state
regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other
competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the future effect of
these factors on the Partnership.

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by
$391,013, a 38.5% decline, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015.
Of this decline, $145,360 and $57,579 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil
and gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $39.67 from $51.75 per barrel (bbl) and
to $2.46 from $2.89 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Also contributing to the decline in sales were $121,633 and $66,441 due to lower volumes
of oil and gas sold, respectively, by 3,066 bbls and 26,967 mcf.
Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the three month period ended June 30,
2016 decreased to $269,161 from $327,323 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015
due to fewer well repairs and workovers.
Production taxes. Production taxes during the three month period ended June 30, 2016
decreased to $37,110 from $54,083 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 due to
lower overall oil and gas revenue.
Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the three
month period ended June 30, 2016 fell to $45,737 from $57,064 for the three month period
ended June 30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the
Partnership.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the
three month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $140,096 from $487,083 for the
three month period ended June 30, 2015. This was due to the overall decrease in oil and
gas production.
Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost ceiling write-downs of $146,484 and $5,529,631
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These were due to lower
average oil and gas prices for the twelve months preceding each write-down.

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by
$735,196, a 40.2% decline, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015.
Of this decline, $311,264 and $194,550 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil
and gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $34.43 from $48.39 per barrel (bbl) and
to $2.29 from $3.10 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the six months ended June 30, 2016
as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Also contributing to the decline in sales were $150,979 and $78,403 due to lower volumes
of oil and gas sold, respectively, by 4,385 bbls and 34,166 mcf.
Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the six month period ended June 30,
2016 decreased to $601,339 from $753,896 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015
due to fewer well repairs and workovers.
Production taxes. Production taxes during the six month period ended June 30, 2016
decreased to $63,840 from $100,630 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 due to
lower overall oil and gas revenue.
Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the six
month period ended June 30, 2016 fell to $83,921 from $111,196 for the six month period
ended June 30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the
Partnership.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the
six month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $294,955 from $917,047 for the six
month period ended June 30, 2015. This was due to the overall decrease in oil and gas
production.
Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost ceiling write-downs totaling $991,101 and
$10,462,723 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These were
due to lower average oil and gas prices for the twelve months preceding each write-down.

Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
1.Interest Rate Risk
The Partnership Agreement allows borrowings from banks or other financial sources of up
to 20% of the total capital contributions to the Partnership without investor approval.
Should the Partnership elect to borrow monies for additional development activity on
Partnership properties, it will be subject to the interest rate risk inherent in borrowing
activities. Changes in interest rates could significantly affect the Partnership’s results of
operations and the amount of net cash flow available for partner distributions. Also, to the
extent that changes in interest rates affect general economic conditions, the Partnership
will be affected by such changes.
2.Commodity Price Risk
The Partnership does not expect to engage in commodity futures trading or hedging
activities or enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other
speculative purposes. The Partnership currently expects to sell a significant amount of its
production from successful oil and gas wells on a month-to-month basis at market prices.
Accordingly, the Partnership is at risk for the volatility in commodity prices inherent in the
oil and gas industry, and the level of commodity prices will have a significant impact on
the Partnership’s results of operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, a 10%
change in the price received for oil and gas production would have had an approximate
$109,000 impact on revenue.
3.Exchange Rate Risk
The Partnership currently has no income from foreign sources or operations in foreign
countries that would subject it to currency exchange rate risk. The Partnership does not
currently expect to purchase any prospects located outside of either the United States or
United States coastal waters in the Gulf of Mexico.
Item 4.Disclosure Controls and Procedures
MD maintains a system of controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable
assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in
this report, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. MD’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with the assistance and
participation of other members of management. Based upon that evaluation, MD’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and
procedures are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the information the
Partnership is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Since MD’s
December 31, 2015 annual report on internal control over financial reporting, and for the
quarter ended June 30, 2016, there have been no changes in MD’s internal controls or in
other factors which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the internal controls over financial reporting.
