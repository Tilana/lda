<p><i> Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that 2011 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on 
the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolutions 7/23 of 28 March 2008 and 10/4 of 25 March 2009, on 
human rights and climate change, and 16/11 of 24 March 2011, on human rights and the 
environment, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
objectives and principles thereof, and emphasizing that parties should, in all climate 
change-related actions, fully respect human rights as enunciated in the outcome of the 
sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention,1 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> the commitment to enable the full, effective and sustained 
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change through 
long-term cooperative action, now, up to and beyond 2012, in order to achieve the ultimate 
objective of the Convention,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>further</i> the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 
21, the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg 
Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development, and recognizing that human beings are at the centre 
of concerns for sustainable development and that the right to development must be fulfilled 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council 
 1 FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, decision 1/CP.16. 
</p>

<p>so as to equitably meet the developmental and environmental needs of present and future 
generations,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the decision to organize, in June 2012, the United Nations Conference 
on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and taking note of the invitation of 
the General Assembly, in its resolution 64/236 of 20 December 2009, to organizations and 
bodies of the United Nations to contribute to the preparatory process for the Conference, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the challenges of climate change to development and to the progress 
made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular with 
regard to the goals on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, on environmental 
sustainability and on health<b>,  
</b></p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible 
cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate 
international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities 
and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and 
economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on 
the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for 
the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights,2 the panel 
discussion on the relationship between climate change and human rights held on 15 June 
2009, at the  eleventh session of the Human Rights Council, and the Social Forum held in 
October 2010, which focused on the relationship between climate change and human rights,  </p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that climate change-related impacts have a range of implications, both 
direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, including, inter alia, the 
right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 
the right to adequate housing and the right to self-determination, and human rights 
obligations relating to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling that in no 
case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing</i> <i>concern</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and 
communities around the world, the effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by 
those segments of the population who are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors 
such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status and disability,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution, and 
that effective international cooperation to enable the full, effective and sustained 
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
accordance with the provisions and principles of the Convention is important in order to 
support national efforts for the realization of human rights implicated by climate change-
related impacts,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential 
to inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate 
change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes,  
</p>

<p> 1. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> that climate change poses an immediate and far-
reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has adverse implications 
for the full enjoyment of human rights;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To convene, prior to the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, a 
seminar on addressing the adverse impacts of climate change on the full enjoyment of 
human rights, with a view to following up on the call for respecting human rights in all 
climate change-related actions and policies, and forging stronger interface and cooperation 
between the human rights and climate change communities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To invite States and other relevant stakeholders, including academic experts, 
civil society organizations and representatives of those segments of the population most 
vulnerable to climate change, to participate actively in the seminar; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To invite the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations 
Development Programme to help organize the seminar, informed by the best available 
science, including the assessment reports and special reports of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> that the seminar will build on the previous work of the Human 
Rights Council and its mechanisms, such as the Social Forum and relevant special 
procedures, while taking into account the outcome of the sixteenth session of the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, held in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, and any pertinent issues arising from the 
seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention , to be held in 
Durban, South Africa in 2011;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To submit to the Human Rights Council, at its nineteenth session, a summary 
report on the above-mentioned seminar, including any recommendations stemming 
therefrom, for consideration of further follow-up action;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To make available to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, at its eighteenth session, the summary report 
of the seminar;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all the 
human and technical assistance necessary for the effective and timely realization of the 
above-mentioned seminar and summary report.
