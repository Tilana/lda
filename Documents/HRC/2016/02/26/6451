 <p></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with 
the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the 
World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political 
or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation 
and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food 
security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced </i>that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities 
to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the 
same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to 
global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and 
economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that there has been virtually no progress made on reducing hunger and that it could increase 
dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, given the 
anticipated increase in the world&#8217;s population and the stress on natural resources,<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
exacerbating destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on the realization of the right 
to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Insecurity in the World 2006</i> (Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, 2006). </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests 
and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and 
livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the theme &#8220;The right to food&#8221;, chosen by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations to mark World Food Day on 16 October 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the Final Declaration adopted at the International Conference on Agrarian 
Reform and Rural Development of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
in P&#244;rto Alegre, Brazil, on 10 March 2006,<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and 
therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international 
levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, 
consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from 
hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that more than 6 million children still die every year from 
hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 854 million 
undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the 
absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according 
to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce 
enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world&#8217;s present population;

</i></p>
<p><i>Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, P&#244;rto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006</i> 
(C 2006/REP), appendix G. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, 
that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable 
childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from 
malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination 
against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, 
including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that 
women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed 
themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a 
gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms 
addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are 
inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free 
from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt 
national plans to combat hunger, and recognizes in this regard the great efforts and positive 
developments with respect to the right to food in some developing countries and regions, 
including those highlighted in the report of the Special Rapporteur;<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  See A/62/289. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural 
development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing 
countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation 
and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are 
small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, 
given the increasing cost of inputs, and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds 
and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; and that support by 
States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element key to food 
security and provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national 
efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and 
through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, 
and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
particularly in Africa;<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also stresses </i>its commitments to promote and protect, without discrimination, the 
economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with international 
human rights obligations and taking into account, as appropriate, the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,<b>12</b> and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations 
and representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep 
concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, 
and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately 
high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous 
discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p>

</b>  United Nations, <i>Treaty Series</i>, vol. 1954, No. 33480. 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  General Assembly resolution 61/295, annex. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization 
of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international 
assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, towards a better realization 
and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms 
for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or natural or man-made 
disasters affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for 
developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security 
policies; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Recognizes </i>the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round 
negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international 
conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their international 
policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have 
a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and 
Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of 
financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the 
number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all 
international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of 
halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as 
set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security<b>5</b> and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration;<b>3</b> </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 20. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people 
at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and 
food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread 
of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in 
particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as 
natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the 
achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary 
responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Calls upon </i>Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant 
stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently 
occurring across Africa and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the 
World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including Southern Africa; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the 
right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common 
projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and 
to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the 
private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring 
sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 26. <i>Recognizes</i> the negative impact of massive rises in prices of food on the realization 
of the right to food, particularly on people in developing countries with a high level of 
dependence on food imports for the fulfilment of nutritional national requirements; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Takes note </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food,<b>13</b> and of his 
valuable work in the promotion of the right to food in all parts of the world and expresses its 
appreciation for the work and commitment of the first mandate-holder to achieving the 
realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Encourages </i>the new mandate-holder on the right to food to discharge his/her 
activities taking into account the important achievements in the fulfilment of the mandate in 
recent years; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Supports </i>the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as extended for a 
period of three years by the Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective 
fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Welcomes </i>the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment 
No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),<b>14</b> in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the 
right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is 
indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of 
Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of

<p>appropriate economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and the 
international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights 
for all; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Recalls </i>general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to water 
(articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant),<b>15</b> in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the importance 
of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in the realization 
of the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the 
Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,<b>7</b> represent a 
practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement 
of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally 
agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Requests </i>the Advisory Committee to consider potential recommendations for 
approval by the Council on possible further measures to enhance the realization of the right to 
food, bearing in mind the priority importance of promoting the implementation of existing 
standards; 
</p>
<p> 35. <i>Welcomes </i>the continued cooperation of the High Commissioner, the Committee and 
the Special Rapporteur, and encourages them to continue their cooperation in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 36. <i>Calls upon </i>all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
his/her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him/her and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their 
countries to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate more effectively; 
</p>
<p> 37. <i>Decides </i>to convene a panel discussion on the realization of the right to food in the 
period of its main session of 2009;

 <p></p>
<p> 38. <i>Recalls </i>the requests made by the General Assembly, in its resolution 62/164, that the 
Special Rapporteur submit to it an interim report at its sixty-third session on the implementation 
of that resolution and to continue his work, including by examining the emerging issues with 
regard to the realization of the right to food within his existing mandate, and by the Council that

in 2009, in accordance with its annual programme of work;  
</p>
<p> 39. <i>Invites </i>Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes,
