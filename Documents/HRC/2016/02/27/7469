<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the human rights situation and the activities of her 
Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In its resolution 24/27, the Human Rights Council invited the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report to its twenty-seventh session 
on the situation of human rights and the activities undertaken by her Office in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. The present report covers the period from June 2013 
to May 2014. 
 In the present report, the High Commissioner commends the efforts made by 
Congolese authorities to address serious human rights concerns. In particular, the 
prosecution of State agents for human rights violations continued to increase, including 
through mobile court hearings. In addition, in February 2014, the Government 
promulgated an Amnesty Law for acts of insurrection, acts of war and political offences, 
excluding amnesty for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious 
violations of human rights. It is also encouraging that the Government has proposed 
legislation aimed at establishing specialized chambers within the civilian justice system 
to try perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The 
Government further constructively engaged with the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p> Despite these efforts, the High Commissioner remains concerned about the 
human rights situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly 
in the eastern provinces. While the defeat of Mouvement du 23 mars (M23), in 
November 2013, has had a positive impact on the security and human rights situation, 
the operations of several armed groups to control resource-rich territories still represent a 
serious threat for civilians, with gross human rights violations being perpetrated, 
including mass rape. 
 Numerous armed groups as well as members of the Congolese defence and 
security forces regularly commit serious human rights violations, particularly in eastern 
provinces affected by conflict. Armed groups remain a predominant threat in the 
provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Orientale and Katanga, as well as in some areas of 
Maniema. 
</p>
<p> The fight against impunity also remains of major concern. The justice system 
faces various challenges in investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of human rights 
violations. Military tribunals, where they exist, are often understaffed and under-
resourced. The lack of independence of the military justice system from military 
hierarchy is particularly problematic. 
 The challenges and threats faced by human rights activists, journalists and 
political opponents further remain of serious concern, particularly in the lead-up to the 
2015 provincial and local elections and the 2016 presidential and legislative elections. 
 The report reiterates previous recommendations of the High Commissioner, 
notably with regard to addressing impunity for past and present violations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/27 
on technical assistance and capacity-building for human rights in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, and is the fourth such report. It provides an overview of the situation of 
human rights, and of the activities undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in the country from June 2013 to May 2014.  
</p><p>2. The report highlights main developments affecting human rights during the 
reporting period. It then focuses on issues concerning the protection of civilians, the fight 
against impunity, and the situation of journalists, human rights defenders and political 
opponents. The report also highlights the Government&#8217;s efforts to fulfil its obligations vis-
&#224;-vis the United Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General trends and major developments affecting the human 
rights situation throughout the country 
</b></p>
<p>3. Between June 2013 and May 2014, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
(UNJHRO) registered human rights violations affecting nearly 6,200 victims, 80 per cent of 
which occurred in the conflict-stricken provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale. 
The most documented type of violations pertained to physical integrity, including torture, 
inhuman and degrading treatment and sexual violence affecting over 2,400 victims. Sexual 
violence remains a major concern, with around 310 incidents registered during the reporting 
period, involving some 730 victims, mostly in North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Violations committed by armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the period under review, combatants of different armed groups, taken 
altogether, were responsible for nearly 50 per cent of the total number of victims registered 
by UNJHRO. Members of M23, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda 
(FDLR), the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and Mai Mai groups were among the main 
perpetrators. The violations were mainly committed during attacks on villages aimed at 
gaining control over certain territories and/or in retaliation for the communities&#8217; real or 
perceived collaboration with opposing parties. 
</p>
<p>5. For example, during an attack on 11 December 2013, at least 21 civilians, including 
11 children, were killed by ADF combatants in Beni territory, North Kivu province. Most 
of the victims were first abducted and then brutally killed by machete, some beheaded. 
They were targeted for their alleged collaboration with Armed Forces of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (FARDC) soldiers.  
</p><p>6. The number of abductions of civilians by armed groups remains alarming. For 
instance, between 25 August and 22 September 2013, at least 73 civilians, including 
13 children, were abducted by armed combatants in three separate incidents in North Kivu. 
Of those abducted, at least 12 were executed and eight women were raped. Most of the 
abductions which took place during the reporting period were committed by ADF 
combatants while a large number of abductions were also reportedly conducted by Nyatura 
combatants in Rutshuru territory, North Kivu province.  
</p>
<p>7. In parts of northern Katanga province, hundreds of civilians were victims of serious 
human rights violations in incidents of violence linked to an insurgency by Mai Mai groups 
known as &#8220;Kata Katanga&#8221;. Following investigation missions conducted from<b> </b>March 2013 </p>


<p>to September 2013, during which over 300 victims and witnesses were interviewed, 
UNJHRO was able to confirm that at least 59 civilians, including four children, were killed 
during different attacks by Mai Mai combatants between May 2012 and June 2013. During 
those attacks, at least 245 civilians, including seven children, were also victims of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment and other violations of the right to physical integrity. This 
included the rape of at least 45 women, including five girls. Other human rights violations 
included the abduction and/or arbitrary or unlawful detention of at least 255 civilians, as 
well as the destruction, including burning, of houses or entire villages. The UNJHRO teams 
faced limited access to the affected areas for the documentation and verification of the high 
number of allegations received throughout the reporting period. The figures mentioned 
above thus only refer to cases that UNJHRO was able to confirm and probably 
underrepresents the actual number of human rights violations committed by various 
combatants. 
</p>
<p>8. According to preliminary findings of a UNJHRO investigation mission conducted 
during the reporting period, at least 106 women, including 33 minors, were reportedly 
raped, at least 100 individuals abducted, and three summarily executed by Mai Mai 
combatants during attacks on villages in Mambasa territory, Orientale province, between 
20 February and 18 May 2014. The majority of those attacks followed the alleged killing of 
the leader of the group, Paul Sadala alias Morgan, by FARDC soldiers, on 14 April 2014, 
while he was reportedly surrendering. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violations committed by the defence and security forces 
</b></p>
<p>9. Defence and security forces were responsible for serious human rights violations in 
various parts of the country, including in non-conflict areas &#8212; affecting nearly 50 per cent 
of the total number of victims of human rights violations documented. 
</p>
<p>10. On 30 December 2013, in Lubumbashi and Kinshasa, 70 civilians were killed, 
mainly by FARDC soldiers, during a defence and security operation against followers of 
political opponent and religious leader Joseph Mukungubila, in response to attacks against 
strategic government installations in Lubumbashi, Kinshasa and Kindu.  
</p>
<p>11. The results of investigations carried out by UNJHRO in July 2013 showed that 
FARDC soldiers had also been responsible for killing at least 19 civilians and for other 
serious human rights violations, including extensive looting, between July 2012 and July 
2013, in Katanga province, during operations in Pweto territory against Mai Mai 
combatants. In an incident on 17 November 2013, in Manono territory, Katanga province, 
FARDC soldiers allegedly shot to death nine adults accused of being Mai Mai Kata 
Katanga combatants. In addition, more than 370 cases of looting and destruction of 
property were reported to have taken place in August and September 2013, during FARDC 
military operations against Forces de r&#233;sistance patriotiques en Ituri (FRPI) combatants in 
several villages in the southern part of Irumu territory, Orientale province. 
</p>
<p>12. Human rights violations, including arbitrary killings, perpetrated by agents of the 
Congolese National Police (PNC) were also registered during the reporting period. In this 
regard, UNJHRO observed that, in the western provinces, the majority of the human rights 
violations registered between June 2013 and May 2014, had been committed by PNC 
agents. Moreover, from 15 November 2013 to 15 February 2014, an operation named 
&#8220;Likofi&#8221;,1 organized in Kinshasa to target so-called &#8220;kulunas&#8221;,2 resulted in the summary

<p>execution of at least nine civilians, including one child, and the enforced disappearance of a 
minimum of 32 civilians, including three children.  
</p>
<p>13. The high number of cases of torture and arbitrary and/or unlawful arrests and 
detention remains of concern throughout the country, including in the western provinces. 
From June 2013 to May 2014, UNJHRO recorded nearly 950 victims of torture, cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment and other violations of the right to physical integrity, 
including sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>14. In May 2014,3 UNJHRO and other United Nations Organization Stabilization 
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) components, along with 
the Vice-Minister of Human Rights, visited 62 detention centres in Kinshasa to monitor 
arrest procedures and conditions of detention, and to assess their compliance with national 
and international human rights standards. At least 99 individuals, who had been illegally 
detained, were released as a result of those visits. UNJHRO also increased awareness 
activities and training on the prohibition of torture, in collaboration with the Government. 
Unfortunately, very few cases of torture were prosecuted during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Protection of civilians  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Main concerns 
</b></p>
<p>15. The protection of civilians at risk of serious threats to their life and physical integrity 
remains a priority, particularly in the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Katanga and 
Orientale, where the Congolese armed forces have been engaged in military operations 
against armed groups. More than 75 per cent of victims of human rights violations 
documented by UNJHRO during the reporting period were registered in those provinces.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>16. The MONUSCO proactive approach to neutralizing armed groups in eastern 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, as mandated by Security Council resolutions 2098 
(2013) and 2147 (2014),4 through the Intervention Brigade, has yielded some positive 
results in terms of security. Indeed, as a result of the Brigade operations, some armed 
groups have been significantly weakened or neutralized. This is particularly the case in 
Rutshuru territory, North Kivu province, which had been under the de facto control of M23 
from November 2012 until it was defeated in October 2013. In addition, the inc<b>r</b>eased 
military pressure on armed groups has forced thousands of combatants to surrender and 
disarm. As of April 2014, 3,700 combatants have gathered in several transit camps, pending 
their participation in the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and 
reintegration programme. Protection issues remain in relation to this process, as<b> </b>former 
combatants are known to harass and intimidate the local population living around the transit 
camps. Due to slow progress in implementing the programme, there is a high risk of 
demobilized combatants returning to armed activities and/or banditry.  
</p>
<p>17. Human rights concerns also emerged in the context of FARDC and MONUSCO 
military operations against armed groups. As FARDC have limited capacity to hold an area 
once it is cleared, this leads to armed groups filling the security vacuum. Furthermore, 
civilians are often victims of reprisal attacks by parties to the conflict due to their actual or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 &#8220;Kulunas&#8221; is the term used to describe groups of armed bandits operating in Kinshasa who have 
</p>
<p>allegedly been responsible for various crimes, including killings and armed robbery.  
 
</p>
<p>3
 The joint visits started in May and ended in June 2014. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 On 28 March 2014, the Security Council adopted resolution 2147 (2014), which renewed the mandate 
</p>
<p>of the Intervention Brigade, granting it the competence to &#8220;neutralize&#8221; armed groups. </p>


<p>perceived collaboration with one of the parties. Ongoing conflicts in eastern Democratic 
Republic of the Congo are further complicated by the relationship between some FARDC 
units and certain armed groups. Indeed, in some cases, FARDC has used certain armed 
groups as proxy forces against other groups, a tactic that has generated further human rights 
violations. As an illustration, on 15 February 2014, a patrol of soldiers from the 813th 
FARDC regiment was reportedly attacked by Alliance des Patriotes pour un Congo libre et 
souverain (APCLS) combatants in Loashi, Masisi territory. In reprisal, nearly 
60 households were burned down in Kasho, almost 90 others in Bonde, and 100 in 
Bukombo, Masisi territory, by soldiers of the regiment in coalition with Nyatura 
combatants. Some destruction of property and looting were reportedly committed in those 
villages during the attacks.  
</p>
<p>18. Of particular concern is the pattern of attacks and reprisals whereby parties to the 
conflict target civilians on the basis of their ethnicity. The lack of State authority in conflict 
areas has pushed some local civilians to create alliances with armed groups, often on ethnic 
lines, in order to receive protection. Such alliances often trigger attacks by the opposing 
group. For instance, in February 2014, gross human rights violations were registered in the 
context of ethnic tension and armed clashes between combatants of the Congolese defence 
forces (Hunde ethnicity) and Nyatura combatants (Hutu ethnicity) in Masisi territory, North 
Kivu province. At least 40 civilians perceived to be collaborating with Nyatura combatants 
were killed in that context, some with firearms and others with machetes. Several villages 
in the area were reportedly burned down by Nyatura elements in reprisal. Some FARDC 
elements have also been responsible for attacks against civilians seemingly along ethnic 
lines. For example, during the reporting period, FARDC elements reportedly committed 
serious human rights violations against civilians believed to be collaborating with Mai Mai 
groups in northern Katanga, against civilians of the Ngiti ethnic group, whom they 
perceived to be affiliated with FRPI combatants in Orientale province, as well as against 
Hunde civilians in Masisi territory, who are associated with APCLS combatants owing to 
their ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>19. The instability linked to armed group activities and FARDC operations against 
armed groups in the east has continued to trigger mass displacement of civilians. Thus, in 
January 2014, when FARDC and MONUSCO began launching military operations against 
ADF in Beni territory, North Kivu province, more than 65,000 people sought refuge around 
the town of Nobili, with the total number of internally displaced persons in the district 
reaching 178,000 at the end of March 2014. The humanitarian situation of those persons 
was further aggravated by the fact that they could not access their fields, their source of 
livelihood and food, due to military operations and the prevailing insecurity. Humanitarian 
personnel have also been experiencing difficulties delivering life-saving aid to those areas 
due to security issues.  
</p>
<p>20. At the same time the improved security situation in certain territories, such as 
Rutshuru in North Kivu province, has facilitated the return of some internally displaced 
persons. Their number thus decreased in all the eastern provinces from 2,964,000 in 
December 2013 to 2,635,000 in March 2014.5 
</p>
<p><b> B. Actions taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>21. UNJHRO has been assigned as the lead component within MONUSCO on 
protection of civilians, particularly in areas affected by conflict. As such, it contributes,

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs monthly figures, &#8220;Democratic Republic of the 
Congo: internally displaced persons and returnees&#8221; (March 2014).  </p>


<p>among other things, to the planning and organization of the deployment of Joint Protection 
Teams, which are interdisciplinary missions comprised of various MONUSCO 
components. They aim at identifying protection threats, especially those linked to armed 
conflict, taking measures to mitigate such threats, recommending steps to MONUSCO 
peacekeeping military contingents and their decision-making bodies on civilian protection 
issues, and seeking accountability for violations &#8212; including as a deterrent to future threats. 
More than 50 such missions took place during the reporting period, in North Kivu, South 
Kivu and Orientale provinces. However, UNJHRO has been facing various constraints in 
that context, particularly lack of access to the most insecure areas.  
</p>
<p>22. During the reporting period, UNJHRO and other MONUSCO components took 
action to strengthen military and civilian cooperation during the planning and in the 
conduct of military operations, with the goal of ensuring the protection of civilians during 
such operations. To this effect, several civil/military forums were set up to work jointly 
towards the common objective of reducing threats against the civilian population, with an 
emphasis on early warning and rapid response functions in areas affected by the conflict. 
</p>
<p>23. UNJHRO continued to provide support for the effective implementation of the 
human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support to non-United Nations 
security forces, which is instrumental in protecting civilians. The policy indeed requires 
that all United Nations assistance to security forces be conditioned upon respect for human 
rights, international humanitarian law, and refugee law. In some cases, the implementation 
of the policy has led to improvements in the behaviour of FARDC troops and has resulted 
in a generally safer environment for civilians.  
</p>
<p>24. On several occasions, however, MONUSCO has intervened to remind the FARDC 
hierarchy that support would be withdrawn from specific units suspected of committing 
human rights violations should violations continue to be perpetrated and mitigating 
measures not be taken. Whilst in the short term the policy aims at putting an end to human 
rights violations, in the longer term it seeks to ensure the accountability of perpetrators and 
capacity-building of the security forces in matters pertaining to human rights promotion and 
protection. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Main developments 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the reporting period, some progress continued to be observed in the fight 
against impunity, more specifically in the prosecution of FARDC and PNC elements, 
particularly of lower ranks, for acts constituting human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>26. According to information available to UNJHRO, from June 2013 to April 2014, 
175 State and non-State actors were convicted for acts constituting human rights violations. 
This number included 136 State agents, including 89 FARDC soldiers (comprising 
11 senior officers), 44 PNC agents, and two elements of the National Intelligence Agency. 
The highest number of convictions was for rape, while the second most common conviction 
was for homicide. Only two individuals were convicted under torture charges during that 
period.  </p>


<p>27. Commitments to address impunity for sexual violence and other human rights 
violations are encouraging.6 Of note are the 13 arrest warrants for international crimes 
against alleged M23 members or their affiliates issued by Congolese judicial authorities 
between May and July 2013. At least 10 of those warrants were issued for crimes against 
humanity, including rape and sexual slavery. Extradition requests for four M23 elements, 
namely Jean-Marie Runiga and Colonels Zimurinda, Ngaruye and Badege, were addressed 
to the Government of Rwanda in July 2013, after those individuals had reportedly fled to 
Rwanda in March 2013. 
</p>
<p>28. However, many challenges remain in the fight against impunity. Several case files 
considered important, given the high number of victims, remain unresolved due to lack of 
action by judicial authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable. For example, 
investigations have been stalled concerning mass rapes allegedly committed in Bushani and 
Kalambahiro by FARDC soldiers, and those allegedly committed in Walikale by members 
of armed groups.7 In those particular cases, few arrests have taken place and the judicial 
authorities have not conducted thorough investigations. In the Bushani and Kalambahiro 
events, the Military Prosecutor&#8217;s Office opened a file with the support of UNJHRO. Two 
officers were questioned and the North Kivu military hierarchy refused to allow more 
officers to be interrogated and provide any relevant documents to the Military Prosecutor. 
Concerning the Walikale events, the only alleged perpetrator who was arrested escaped 
during a mass breakout from Goma prison during the fall of Goma in November 2012. 
</p>
<p>29. While judicial authorities initiated investigations into some of the violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms committed during the 2011 electoral period,8 little 
progress has been observed with regard to the prosecution of the alleged perpetrators of 
gross violations committed in Kinshasa in that context. 
</p>
<p>30. On 5 May 2014, the Operational Military Court of North Kivu delivered its 
judgement on the <i>Minova</i> case9 and convicted 26 FARDC soldiers, but most were acquitted 
regarding charges of rape and their superiors were exonerated from command 
responsibility. Only two soldiers were convicted for rape, one for murder and the others for 
charges such as looting and violations of the military code. This is of concern as, based on 
investigation missions into the case conducted from 30 November to 17 December 2012, 
UNJHRO confirmed that at least 135 victims, including 33 girls had been raped during the 
Minova incident. Although there is no possibility for appeal, in contravention of

</p>
<p>9
 On 20 November 2013, in Goma, the Operational Military Court of North Kivu held its first hearing 
</p>
<p>in the <i>Minova </i>case pertaining to serious human rights violations, including mass rape, committed by 
FARDC soldiers in Minova and surrounding areas, Kalehe territory, South Kivu province, between 
20 November and 2 December 2012. Thirty-nine FARDC elements, including seven senior officers, 
were accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes of rape, as well as other crimes and military 
offences. MONUSCO provided technical advice to the prosecution, as well as assistance concerning 
the security and protection of victims and witnesses, in coordination with international partners.  </p>


<p>international humanitarian law and human rights law standards10 and the Constitution, the 
victims&#8217; lawyers have filed an appeal against the judgement.11

of military superiors, including for the misconduct of units under their command. It also 
highlights the limitations of the judicial institutions in prosecuting the crime of rape, as well 
as the lack of thorough judicial investigations into grave crimes. Many other cases of 
serious human rights violations have remained unpunished and/or related investigations 
have been marked by prolonged delays.12 
</p>
<p>32. For instance, in the <i>Chebeya</i> case,13 the appeal proceedings that opened in 2012 
before the highest military court (Haute Cour Militaire) were suspended in May 2013, 
following the submission of the victims&#8217; lawyers regarding a procedural error in the judicial 
notice to the accused. As required by the Constitution, the Haute Cour Militaire suspended 
its hearings on the appeal case, pending a decision from the Supreme Court which has 
exclusive jurisdiction to hear any constitutional challenges. There is no information as to 
when the Supreme Court will act upon the case.14 
</p>
<p>33. During the reporting period, the Government had not taken any action to establish a 
reliable vetting mechanism for its security forces, although various United Nations human 
rights mechanisms15 have consistently called for measures to ensure that human rights 
violators are not maintained within, or integrated into, the security forces. Consequently, 
individuals suspected of committing gross human rights violations remain within the armed 
forces, including senior officers.  
</p>
<p>34. During the universal periodic review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 
29 April 2014, the Minister of Justice and Human Rights announced that a new version of 
the draft law on specialized chambers had been submitted to Parliament. In May 2014, the 
bill was sent back by Parliament on the grounds of constitutional concerns. Further to the 
ratification by the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 11 April 2002 of the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court, legislation which would implement the Rome Statute 
into national laws remains to be adopted. Ideally, the two bills should be discussed by 
Parliament in a manner that ensures their complementarity and avoids the creation of legal 
gaps or contradictions.

<p>13 Floribert Chebeya and his driver, Fid&#232;le Bazana, were assassinated on 2 June 2010, on the outskirts of 
Kinshasa. On 23 June 2011, the Military Court of Kinshasa/Gombe convicted five policemen, three of 
them in absentia, of murder, illegal arrest and detention as well as abduction in that case, but stopped 
short of finding any criminal responsibility of higher-level police officers, in particular the then 
Commissioner-General of the Congolese National Police, General John Numbi. All parties to the 
proceedings, including the State, the defence and the victims appealed against the verdict of the trial 
court. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 In June 2014, acting on behalf of the families of Mr. Chebeya and Mr. Bazana, a group of NGOs led 
</p>
<p>by the International Federation of Human Rights, filed a complaint in Senegal against one of the 
accused who had reportedly fled to that country after escaping from prison in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.

<p><b> B. Actions taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. UNJHRO has continued to provide assistance to the justice authorities in the fight 
against impunity, including technical and logistical support to bring investigators and 
magistrates to sites where human rights violations have been committed. More specifically, 
in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme and national and 
international NGOs, UNJHRO provided support to four missions,16 conducted by judicial 
authorities in various parts of the country, to investigate human rights violations, including 
extrajudicial or summary executions, torture, sexual violence, and arbitrary and/or unlawful 
arrests and detention.  
</p>
<p>36. For example, from 6 to 12 January 2014, a joint team, composed of UNJHRO staff 
members, other MONUSCO colleagues and personnel from the Military Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office were deployed to Irumu territory, Orientale province, to investigate allegations of 
human rights violations committed in the context of FARDC military operations against 
FRPI combatants. The investigation resulted in the arrest of 18 FARDC elements who have 
since been charged with various crimes, including summary executions, rape, arbitrary 
arrests and illegal detention. Four were released due to lack of evidence.  
</p>
<p>37. During the reporting period, UNJHRO also provided logistical and technical 
assistance to three mobile court hearings,17 in collaboration with other partners. For 
instance, it provided financial support to mobile court hearings in Kalehe, South Kivu 
province, from 19 to 28 May 2014. As a result, the South Kivu military court convicted five 
FARDC soldiers and two PNC agents of sexual violence, issuing sentences ranging from 
four to 15 years of imprisonment. UNJHRO monitored the trial and observed that due 
process had been observed. The victims and the accused had legal representation and 
protection measures were implemented to protect the victims who testified during closed 
hearings. Besides ensuring accountability, another benefit of such hearings was the 
visibility of justice in the communities where the violations occurred.  
</p><p>38. The fight against impunity was a prominent item during the visit of the United 
Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in August 2013.18 The Deputy High Commissioner reiterated the OHCHR 
commitment to assisting the authorities in the fight against impunity for gross human rights 
violations and discussed how to move forward with prosecutions concerning emblematic 
cases, including rape cases and other gross human rights violations committed in Walikale 
and Bushani, North Kivu province, in Ituri, Orientale province, and Minova, South Kivu 
province.19 She stressed the need to prosecute all perpetrators of sexual violence, including 
high-ranking officers.  
</p>
<p>39. On 25 March 2014, the Human Rights Council, with OHCHR support, held a high-
level dialogue on lessons learned and continuing challenges in combating sexual violence 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 To South Kivu, North Kivu, Equateur and Orientale provinces.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>17
 Of the three hearings supported by UNJHRO during the reporting period, two were in South Kivu and 
</p>
<p>one in Equateur province.  
 
</p>
<p>18
 From 22 to 28 August 2013, the Deputy High Commissioner, Flavia Pansieri, visited the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo (see OHCHR press release, &#8220;Respect for human rights key to stabilization 
succeeding in DRC&#8221;, 28 August 2013, available from 
www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13667&amp;LangID=E).

<p>in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.20 The event brought together a broad range of 
speakers, including the Minister of Justice and Human Rights and the Minister of Gender, 
Family and Child Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Deputy Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Head of the Rule of Law Component of MONUSCO, the Vice-Chair of the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; the Permanent Representative of the 
African Union to the United Nations in Geneva, one NGO representative and the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The fight against impunity was discussed, 
as well as the questions of prevention, multisectoral assistance to survivors, and reparations. 
Various interventions from Member States conveyed the need for further action to 
strengthen the justice system, protect victims and witnesses, and ensure the affordability 
and accessibility of justice. 
</p><p>40. Public reporting has remained a core activity of UNJHRO and has been a tool for 
contributing to the fight against impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 
addition to the report of the High Commissioner on the situation of human rights and the 
activities of her Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo presented to the Human 
Rights Council in September 2013,21 public reports were issued on human rights violations 
committed on election-related human rights violations,22 and on the fight against impunity 
for sexual violence.23 The latter documented more than 3,600 victims of rape perpetrated by 
State agents, mainly FARDC soldiers, and members of armed groups, and analysed some of 
the challenges in the administration of justice during 2010&#8211;2013. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of journalists, human rights defenders and political 
opponents 
</b></p>
<p>41. The situation of human rights defenders and journalists in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo remains precarious as, owing to their activities, they continue to be victims of 
killings, death threats, physical attacks, intimidation, harassment, and arbitrary and/or 
unlawful arrests and detention by State agents and armed groups. UNJHRO has recorded 
human rights violations against more than 40 human rights defenders and 20 journalists 
during the period under review.  
</p>
<p>42. UNJHRO recorded several cases involving security and defence forces harassing, 
intimidating, and confiscating equipment from journalists. For instance, in July 2013, in 
Kolwezi, Katanga province, two journalists from a local television station were beaten and 
had their cameras confiscated by PNC agents after filming the forced eviction of a family. 
In another incident, on 20 January 2014, in Goma, North Kivu province, a journalist from 
an independent radio station was reportedly beaten and his video camera confiscated by an 
agent of the Republican Guard who had accused him of investigating the illegal allocation 
of plots on the shores of Lake Kivu to FARDC soldiers.  
</p>
<p>43. Armed groups also targeted human rights defenders. For example, in August 2013, 
in Kawankolo, Pweto territory, Katanga province, a human rights activist was reportedly 
killed by a group of Mai Mai Kata Katanga combatants. The victim had denounced human

<p>rights violations allegedly committed in the territory during clashes between FARDC 
soldiers and Mai Mai Kata Katanga combatants. In March 2014, a female human rights 
activist and lawyer was found dead in Beni territory, North Kivu province. She had 
reportedly been stabbed to death by unidentified individuals.  
</p>
<p>44. Members or supporters of opposition parties have also been exposed to human rights 
violations. Since June 2013, UNJHRO has recorded around 20 cases of human rights 
violations committed by State agents against members of the opposition and their 
supporters. For instance, in February 2014, in Bukavu, South Kivu province, at least 
26 civilians, including 10 supporters of the Union pour la nation congolaise, were 
reportedly injured by PNC agents during a political rally organized by the Union President, 
Vital Kamerhe. Victims treated at a local hospital suffered from tear gas, gunshot wounds 
and beatings. Furthermore, Mr. Kamerhe&#8217;s activities were restricted by the authorities on 
several occasions and he was denied access to fly from Kinshasa to the east of the country 
to launch his &#8220;caravan of peace&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>45. Those developments are particularly worrying in the light of the 2015 local and 
provincial elections and the 2016 presidential and legislative elections. It is worth recalling 
that during the 2011 electoral period, the main victims of human rights violations were 
people identified as political party members or sympathizers, mainly targeted by defence 
and security forces who aimed at restricting their activities. 
</p>
<p>46. On 29 April 2014, during the universal periodic review of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, the Government indicated that a draft law on the protection of human rights 
defenders would be submitted to Parliament for the second time. OHCHR has been 
supporting NGO initiatives towards the adoption of the bill on the protection of human 
rights defenders. On 6 and 7 March 2014, UNJHRO, in partnership with the Carter Center, 
and through the Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund, provided technical and 
financial support for the organization of a workshop aimed at finalizing and validating the 
bill. The workshop brought together a member of the National Assembly, a senator, legal 
advisers from the Ministry of Justice, and more than 20 representatives of NGOs or human 
rights defenders. The workshop provided an opportunity to produce new draft legislation. 
The High Commissioner encourages the prompt adoption of the bill.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Update on national mechanisms for the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National human rights commission 
</b></p>
<p>47. On 21 March 2013, following high-level advocacy by the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights, local human rights groups and UNJHRO, legislation was promulgated 
establishing a national human rights commission. However, as of June 2014, the 
Commission had not yet been set up as Parliament had not appointed its members, as 
foreseen by the law.24 The High Commissioner encourages the Parliament to promptly 
ensure the appointment of commissioners.

<p><b> B. National and provincial <i>entit&#233;s de liaison</i>  
</b></p>
<p>48. During the reporting period, all provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
were equipped with a provincial <i>entit&#233; de liaison</i>, a forum of discussion on human rights 
violations involving the authorities and human rights partners, including UNJHRO. The 
steering committee of the national <i>entit&#233; de liaison</i> was set up on 25 January 2014 and is 
chaired by the Prime Minister. However, the <i>entit&#233;s de liaison</i> should be properly financed 
and resourced in order to be operational.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council 
reviewed the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 29 April 
2014.25 UNJHRO organized a live transmission of the session for representatives of the 
Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, NGOs and the diplomatic community in Kinshasa. 
On 2 May 2014, the Working Group adopted its final report on the review of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, which contained 229 recommendations. The 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo accepted 190 of the 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>50. Many States urged the Government to strengthen efforts to combat sexual violence 
by ensuring that all perpetrators are brought to justice and victims gain increased access to 
justice. Many also called on the authorities to ensure that the rights to freedoms of 
expression and peaceful assembly be respected; to enact legislation to give effect to the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; and to operationalize the national human 
rights commission. 
</p>
<p>51. The recommendations rejected by the Government included a call to abolish the 
death penalty, and a request to extend a standing invitation to all special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>52. The universal periodic review process was supported throughout by UNJHRO. The 
Office held workshops for Government officials and civil society members in preparation 
for the review. On 20 and 21 November 2013, in Kinshasa, UNJHRO and the Carter Center 
organized a workshop for 27 NGO representatives and human rights groups on the 
submission procedure for NGO contributions to the review. The workshop also served as a 
platform to discuss the recommendations issued in the 2009 universal periodic review of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how the second review process could be used to 
address the most important human rights concerns. From 16 to 20 December 2013, in 
Kinshasa, OHCHR trained 42 individuals, including members of the Interministerial 
Committee on Human Rights and NGO representatives, on how to submit reports for the 
universal periodic review and to the United Nations human rights treaty bodies. On 21 and 
22 January 2014, in Kinshasa, UNJHRO held a workshop that included ministers and civil 
society actors, to review the State report. As a result of UNJHRO efforts, several NGOs 
submitted quality contributions to the universal periodic review and the Government 
submitted its State party report to the Human Rights Council in a timely manner.

<p>53. On 15 May 2014, UNJHRO<b> </b>jointly with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights 
and two international NGOs, organized a workshop on follow-up to universal periodic 
review recommendations.<b> </b>In total, 165 persons participated in the event, including 
Members of Parliament and representatives of the Interministerial Committee on Human 
Rights, representatives of the diplomatic corps and different ministries, lawyers, journalists 
and human rights activists. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Review of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women 
</b></p>
<p>54. In July 2013, the Government presented its combined sixth and seventh periodic 
reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The 
Committee noted some progress in the area of women&#8217;s rights, including the adoption of 
the National Strategy against gender-based violence and the promulgation of the law to 
establish the National Human Rights Commission.26 However, the Committee raised 
several concerns, including the shocking levels and nature of violence and sexual atrocities 
against women, and the lack of a proper vetting process to remove persons suspected of 
perpetrating serious human rights violations from official positions in the security forces. 
The Committee raised concerns over high levels of violence and discrimination against 
women in the entire country, including harmful practices and discriminatory legislation. It 
recommended that the Government prioritize the fight against impunity for sexual violence 
and ensure access to justice for all women affected by sexual violence during the conflict.27 
The Committee also requested the submission of information, within two years, on the 
implementation of recommendations to prevent and address sexual violence, to ensure 
access to justice, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions in the Family Code. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is at a critical 
juncture on the long journey to improve the human rights situation of people living on 
its territory. Visible gains have been achieved in enhancing security and stability in 
eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a positive impact on the human rights 
situation in some cases. Increased prosecutions of State agents for human rights 
violations also constitute an important momentum towards justice.</b>  
56. <b>Despite some progress, efforts to protect human rights remain hampered by 
several overarching challenges. One of the main challenges remains the prevalence of 
impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations, especially high-level FARDC 
soldiers and leaders of armed groups.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Persisting impunity is itself partly due to another major structural challenge, 
which is the weakness of the justice system, and a general lack of effective 
accountability mechanisms. The justice system is undermined by deficiencies in 
conducting investigations, prosecuting perpetrators of human rights violations, and 
ensuring that prison terms are served. Military tribunals continue to be under-

<p><b>resourced and consequently often lack the capacity to investigate and prosecute those 
responsible for many of the reported cases of human rights violations. More 
fundamentally, the lack of independence of the military justice system from the 
military hierarchy is a major concern. Fighting impunity for human rights violations 
requires coordinated and determined efforts by the executive branch, law 
enforcement bodies and judicial authorities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Address past human rights violations, including through the prompt 
adoption of the law on the specialized chambers consistent with international 
standards and, following broad consultations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Speed up the reform of the security sector, including the establishment of 
a reliable vetting mechanism, so that perpetrators of human rights violations are not 
maintained within or integrated into the security forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the future national human rights commission is operational 
through the prompt appointment of its members and appropriate financial and 
logistical capacity support for its effective functioning, in accordance with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and 
protection of human rights (Paris Principles);  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
and accordingly, and with the assistance of the Subcommittee on the Prevention of 
Torture established in the context of the Protocol, create a national mechanism to 
prevent torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Enact an appropriate legal framework for the protection of human 
rights defenders, journalists and other media workers and the strengthening/and or 
creation of protection mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly be 
respected so as to create a safe and conducive environment for the legitimate and 
peaceful activities of civil society;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Devise a national action plan for the implementation of 
recommendations of the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the 
universal periodic review and treaty bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Extend a standing invitation to all thematic special procedures mandate 
holders, and provide detailed responses to their communications. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>In view of the above recommendations, the Human Rights Council should 
continue to be seized of the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo.
