<p><b> I. Mandate and strategic priorities</b>1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children is 
a high-profile, global independent advocate on the prevention and elimination of all forms 
of violence against children, and a bridge-builder and a catalyst of actions in all regions, 
and across sectors and settings where violence against children may occur. Her mandate is 
framed by the United Nations Study on Violence against Children and its strategic 
recommendations (A/61/299) and promotes children&#8216;s protection from violence as a human 
rights imperative.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Representative makes use of mutually supportive strategies, including 
the promotion of advocacy on children&#8216;s protection from violence; the contribution to 
</p>
<p>international, regional and national consultations to accelerate progress in this field, to 
identify good practices and promote the cross-fertilization of experiences; the organization 
of field missions; and the development of thematic studies and reports.  
</p>
<p>3. The overall thrust of the Special Representative&#8216;s mandate is to accelerate progress 
in the implementation of the Study recommendations. In view of their particular urgency, 
three of these recommendations were identified with time-bound targets. These are also the 
areas to which the Special Representative gives priority attention, namely: 
</p>
<p> (a) The development in each State of a national comprehensive strategy to 
prevent and respond to all forms of violence; 
</p>
<p> (b) The introduction of an explicit legal ban on all forms of violence against 
children, in all settings; and 
</p>
<p> (c) The consolidation of a national system of data collection, analysis and 
dissemination, and a research agenda on violence against children. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Representative has pursued these priorities through a process of regional 
engagement with intergovernmental organizations and political groupings, the convening of 
expert consultations on strategic dimensions of the violence against children agenda, the 
development of thematic reports in support of advocacy, policy and legal reform,2 and over 
50 missions in all regions. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Consolidating progress in the strategic agenda for the 
implementation of the United Nations Study 
</b></p>
<p>5.  In the first year of the Special Representative&#8216;s mandate, particular attention was 
given to the revitalization of networks involved in the development of the Study, the 
promotion of new alliances and consolidation of strategic partnerships, and the 
institutionalization of regional processes and governance structures on violence against 
children. These efforts have been critical to promote the mainstreaming of children&#8216;s 
freedom from violence in the policy agenda at the international, regional and national 
levels. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Special Representative assumed her position on 1 September, 2009 and a fuller explanation of 
</p>
<p>her appointment and mandate can be found in document A/HRC/13/46 of 2 February 2010. 
 2 See thematic report on child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms presented to 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/16/56). </p>


<p>6. The mandate&#8216;s second year was a key period to rally firm support to address 
persisting challenges, and speed up global progress towards a world free from violence. 
With this in mind, the Special Representative promoted regional consultations in South 
Asia, South America, Central and Eastern Europe, Central America and with the League of 
Arab States, and organized three expert consultations on critical topics, namely child-
sensitive mechanisms to address incidents of violence, law reform to secure children&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>protection from all forms of violence, and preventing and addressing violence against 
children in schools. The main conclusions and recommendations of the latter two meetings 
are addressed below. In early 2012, an expert consultation will be held on the protection 
from violence of children within the justice system.  
</p>
<p>7. As part of her advocacy and communication strategy, the Special Representative 
established a website3 to disseminate information on developments on children&#8216;s protection 
from violence. The website is also a platform for networking amongst key partners and 
includes social media tools and a Children&#8216;s Corner with child-friendly materials.  
</p>
<p>8. Within the overall framework of her priority agenda to promote progress in the 
development of national integrated strategies on violence against children; in the 
strengthening of children&#8216;s legal protection from violence in all its forms; and in the 
consolidation of data and research on violence against children, in 2011 the Special 
Representative placed a particular emphasis on the promotion of the following strategic 
initiatives: 
</p>
<p> (a) Moving towards the universal ratification of the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention, particularly to ensure children&#8216;s protection from sale, prostitution and 
</p>
<p>pornography; 
</p>
<p> (b) Widening awareness and advocacy to prevent and address violence against 
children in schools, and in justice-related institutions; 
</p>
<p> (c) Conducting a global survey to assess progress in the prevention and 
elimination of all forms of violence against children; and 
</p>
<p> (d)  Consolidating the institutionalization of regional processes and governance 
structures in support of national efforts to prevent and eliminate violence against children 
</p>
<p>9. Within the United Nations system, the normative foundation of children&#8216;s protection 
from violence was strengthened by the adoption by the General Assembly of the third 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
procedure, and with the new International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention on 
Decent Work for Domestic Workers. Other critical contributions were the debate in the 
Human Rights Council on the rights of children working and living on the street, and the 
general comment adopted by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the right of the 
child to freedom from violence. 
</p>
<p>10. At the regional level, strong political commitments were made, and governance 
structures established in support of the follow-up to the recommendations of the Study. In 
some cases, a roadmap and a monitoring mechanism are in place to capture change, 
disseminate good practices and galvanize national efforts.  
</p>
<p>11. These developments have been crucial to support States in national implementation 
efforts to consolidate children&#8216;s protection from violence, including in the three priority 
</p>
<p>areas identified by the Special Representative&#8216;s mandate.

<p><b> A. Promoting national integrated strategies to prevent and eliminate all 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>12. The development of national integrated strategies to prevent and eliminate all forms 
of violence against children has been pursued by countries in all regions, both through 
broad child protection initiatives and specific national plans to end violence, in some cases 
with the identification of specific objectives. 
</p>
<p>13. Recognized as a priority by regional organizations and political groupings, important 
efforts have been made to support national implementation. Regional initiatives enabled the 
sharing and cross-fertilization of national experiences, and the development of national 
strategies in the framework of agreed regional agendas. In some cases, regional 
consultations were held on this topic, such as the Council of Europe meeting for Central 
and Eastern European States, held in Kyiv, entitled &#8213;Combating violence against children: 
from isolated actions to integrated strategies&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>14. The valuable regional studies and analytical mappings conducted during the past 
year by the League of Arab States, the South Asia Initiative to End Violence against 
Children, the Council of Europe, the MERCOSUR Permanent Commission on the 
Nin@Sur Initiative, and by Central American countries were instrumental to capture 
national developments and draw lessons. These studies identified recommendations to 
guide the development of child-centred and multidisciplinary approaches, and strengthen 
the effectiveness of coordinating mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>15. Across regions, recommendations highlighted in particular the need for the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of a national comprehensive strategy with an integrated and 
holistic approach to violence prevention and elimination, bridging disciplines and 
actors and identifying specific goals; it should be mainstreamed across all relevant 
departments and national and decentralized authorities, and integrated as a key 
component of the national policy agenda;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Effective coordination by a high-level entity with the authority, influence and 
capacity to lead the design, implementation and evaluation of the national strategy, 
and to provide the needed guidance to all actors, including relevant officials and 
professionals and children themselves; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of all relevant departments and 
institutions dealing with violence against children, indispensable to avoid overlap 
and poor coordination and promote synergies between them, and to train relevant 
professionals on prevention, identification, child-centred and child-sensitive 
assessment and reporting of violence against children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Allocation of specific and adequate budgets for implementation, including through 
the transfer of financial resources from national to decentralized levels in line with 
the responsibilities assigned, as a means of securing children&#8216;s effective protection 
</p>
<p>in all parts of the country;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Clear identification of the timeframe of the strategy to mobilize action and monitor 
progress through the issuance of public periodic reports; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Active involvement of strategic stakeholders, including academia, civil society and 
child-led organizations to advance the process of effective implementation. </p>


<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Children&#8217;s voices 
</p>
<p>Children and adolescents have been crucial actors in policy development. As highlighted by 
the consultation they held in April 2011, in Paraguay, &#8213;If we are not capable to find 
</p>
<p>responses to our difficult problems, it is hard to expect that others can do it for us! It is 
important to participate in consultations and share our views about what happens to the 
protection of children, adolescents and young people, especially at the community level&#8214;. 
 
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>Strengthening children&#8217;s legal protection from all forms of violence <b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. Legislation prohibiting all forms of violence is a key component of national 
strategies on violence against children, and an area where progress is gaining momentum. 
To learn from and further advance legal reform, the Special Representative organized, in 
July 2011 in Geneva, an expert consultation on law reform with the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
(IPU) and the NGO Advisory Council on Violence against Children, and she will issue a 
thematic report on this topic in the coming months. The conclusions and recommendations 
of the consultation are summarized below. 
</p>
<p>17. When the Study was finalized, 16 countries had legislation prohibiting physical 
violence in all settings. Currently, more than 30 have a comprehensive legal ban on 
violence against children, at times in the Constitution itself. In addition, many countries 
have adopted legislation on specific forms of violence against children, including sexual 
abuse and exploitation, corporal punishment, bullying, trafficking and harmful traditional 
practices.  
</p>
<p>18. In some countries, courts have been instrumental in establishing the right of the 
child to respect for his or her physical integrity and to freedom from violence, including 
within the home. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh recently declared &#8213;we have no 
hesitation to hold that in the light of the Convention corporal punishment upon the children 
must be prohibited in all settings, including schools, homes and work places&#8214;.4 
</p>
<p>19. During the last two years, the goal of a comprehensive legal ban on all forms of 
violence has been embraced by the Council of Europe, the League of Arab States, the 
Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and 
the South Asia Initiative to End Violence against Children (SAIEVAC). The African 
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also actively support 
full prohibition of violence against children, as do Ombuds for children, parliamentarians, 
religious leaders and countless NGOs and professional groups around the world. 
</p>
<p>20. Despite these important developments, vigorous efforts are still required. Efforts to 
introduce an explicit comprehensive legal ban need to be scaled up, as only around 5 per 
cent of the world&#8216;s child population benefit from legal protection from all forms of 
violence. Moreover, measures to narrow the gap between law and practice need to be 
actively pursued. Enforcement of legislation remains a challenge, especially where it 
prohibits practices that are deeply rooted in society. As highlighted by the expert 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Case], Writ Petition No. 5684 of 2010, Judgment of 13 January 2011, p.31, available at 
www.blast.org.bd/judgements. </p>


<p>consultation, when legislative initiatives on violence against children are pursued, the 
dimensions set out in the following paragraphs need to be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>21. Firstly, as an essential building-block of a robust national child protection system, 
legislation needs to be supported by well-coordinated and resourced services and 
institutions, and pursued through a holistic approach to address the root causes and promote 
investment in the prevention of violence. The establishment by law of accessible, safe and 
child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms to address incidents of 
violence is a crucial dimension of this process.  
</p>
<p>22. Secondly, law reform is a long-term and ongoing process which cannot be reduced 
to isolated or fragmented actions.  It requires consistent efforts to ensure harmonization 
with international standards and implement political commitments undertaken in this area; 
to identify and fill gaps in implementation and to address emerging concerns, such as those 
arising from the use of new technologies or addressing children on the move.  
</p>
<p>23. Thirdly, legislation to protect children from violence is by nature complex and wide-
ranging. It requires a comprehensive and explicit legal ban to convey an unequivocal 
message of the imperative to safeguard children&#8216;s right to freedom from violence, 
</p>
<p>everywhere and at all times. Through constitutional reform, or the introduction of new 
provisions in family and criminal codes, in child protection and domestic violence 
legislation, this process is gaining ground in an increasing number of States. 
</p>
<p>24. A general legal prohibition of violence must be reinforced and complemented by 
detailed provisions in specific pieces of legislation, both to address distinct forms of 
violence, such as sexual abuse and exploitation, bullying, trafficking, corporal punishment 
or harmful traditional practices, and to tackle violence in different settings, including 
schools, care and justice institutions, the community and the home. It is critical to develop 
laws and regulations in all relevant fields to give full meaning to the prohibition, to 
establish procedures for reporting, referral and investigation, to secure the protection of 
victims and witnesses, impose effective sanctions to those found responsible, and to fight 
impunity. Both these approaches, comprehensive and specific, are therefore needed and in 
fact mutually reinforcing.  
</p>
<p>25. Fourthly, law reform initiatives are not relevant for legal experts only. They have 
been particularly successful when promoted in a participatory process, with the 
involvement of key stakeholders including governmental departments, parliamentarians, 
independent children&#8216;s rights institutions, and key actors in civil society, including 
</p>
<p>professional groups, religious communities, non-governmental organizations and young 
people themselves. With a far-reaching approach, legislation lays the foundation for a 
culture of respect for children&#8216;s rights, and can trigger a process of lasting change in 
</p>
<p>attitudes and behaviour, in overcoming social taboos and the social acceptance of violence 
against children.   
</p>
<p>26. Similarly, law enforcement has been more effective when legislative processes have 
been supported with social mobilization initiatives and awareness-raising campaigns (both 
for the public at large, and children and their families in particular) and supported by the 
development of ethical standards, capacity-building activities and concrete guidance for 
professionals and institutions working for and with children. With this in mind, law reform 
initiatives should include a clear plan of implementation, with an estimation of costs, and 
an anticipated allocation of resources to meet them.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Consolidating data and research on violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>27. Good data and research are the bedrock of national planning, effective policy-
making and adequate resource allocation to prevent violence and protect children. With </p>


<p>sound evidence, Governments are empowered to make the right decisions at the right time. 
Unfortunately, many challenges prevail. Indeed, information on violence against children 
remains scarce and fragmented and, as a result, opportunities to consolidate children&#8216;s 
protection and invest in violence prevention are equally constrained.  
</p>
<p>28. This is why the consolidation of research and of national data systems constitutes a 
priority for the mandate. The Special Representative will organize with the Government of 
Sweden an Expert Consultation on this topic. The consultation, to be held in May 2012, 
will provide a strategic platform to learn from and build upon significant initiatives 
promoted by strategic partners, including national Governments, United Nations agencies, 
international and regional organizations, academia, independent children&#8216;s rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>29. The meeting will aim at bridging efforts between statistical offices, research 
institutions and governmental departments responsible for children and violence-related 
activities, refining tools and methodologies to overcome knowledge gaps, and promoting 
evidence-based advocacy, policy and mobilization of resources. The consultation will be a  
forum to reflect on ethical approaches to take into account the experience and perceptions 
of violence by children in surveys and research.  
</p>
<p>30. A growing number of initiatives promoted around the world offer new opportunities 
to break the invisibility of violence and mobilize action and support towards its prevention 
and elimination. National surveys on violence against children conducted over the recent 
past constitute an important reference in this regard, particularly when &#8211; as was for instance 
the case in the United Republic of Tanzania5 and in the United States of America6 &#8211; these 
surveys were based on wide-scale interviews with children and young people. In both cases, 
the surveys provided a comprehensive, sound and frank picture of the incidence of physical, 
emotional and sexual violence against children, revealing its pervasive nature and also its 
frequent practice by people children know and trust &#8211; in the community, in the school and 
within the home. In both cases there was also recognition of the exposure of children to 
different and cumulative forms of violence, and to the serious and long-lasting trauma and 
distress. 
</p>
<p>31. The Tanzanian study was critical in assessing the extent to which social, health and 
justice services were being used by children affected by violence. Developed by a multi-
sector task force, the study helped to capture the multidimensional nature of violence and 
the importance of well-coordinated and mutually supportive roles of governmental 
departments and civil society organizations in violence prevention and response.  
</p>
<p>32. The American survey addressed a wide range of situations where children are 
exposed to violence, from physical assault, sexual victimization and child maltreatment, to 
witnessing violence in the family and in the community, and enduring bullying, Internet 
victimization and dating violence It also considered the cumulative effects of children&#8216;s 
exposure over time to various forms of violence, as well as across different age groups. 
With this far-reaching scope and the promotion of a comprehensive approach beyond 
individual types of violence, and across disciplines and services, the survey findings are 
</p>
<p>  
 5 The Tanzanian study was conducted by a National Multi-Sector Task Force chaired by the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Community Development, Gender and Children in cooperation with the Muhimbili University, the 
Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF - 
http://www.unicef.org/media/files/VIOLENCE_AGAINST_CHILDREN_IN_TANZANIA_REPORT
.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 6 The US national survey on children&#8216;s exposure to violence was sponsored by the Office of Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention and CDC; available from  
http://www.safestartcenter.org/pdf/childrens-exposure-to-violence.pdf. </p>


<p>expected to better equip actors to prevent violence, and help child victims overcome the 
impact of this phenomenon.   
</p>
<p>33. In both surveys, one outcome was the identification of new knowledge gaps, 
generating commitment to promote complementary research: in the case of Tanzania to 
address the situation of particularly vulnerable groups of children, who had not been 
included in the initial survey; in the case of the United States, to assess the long-term 
effects of violence on children&#8216;s and adults&#8216; health and well-being.  
</p>
<p>34. The findings of the Tanzanian survey have paved the way to an implementation 
phase, initiated with the Government&#8216;s launch of a coordinated response to address the 
concerns revealed by the survey. Important efforts are being made to raise awareness and 
mobilize public support to overcome social acceptance of this phenomenon and social 
pressure inhibiting child victims from reporting. 
</p>
<p>35. In a significant number of other countries there are encouraging steps towards 
conducting similar comprehensive national surveys on violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Strategic initiatives promoted in support of violence 
prevention and elimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Moving towards the universal ratification of the Optional Protocols to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>36. The global campaign for the universal ratification of the Optional Protocols, 
launched in 2010 with the Secretary-General, provides a sound agenda for consolidating the 
institutional partnership with strategic allies within the United Nations system, including 
the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, the United Nations Children&#8216;s 
Fund (UNICEF), OHCHR, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The campaign 
also resulted in collaboration with ILO and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC). 
</p>
<p>37. In the light of her mandate, the Special Representative places a special focus on 
achieving global adherence to the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. She pursues this agenda through global advocacy, 
regional engagement and field missions.  
</p>
<p>38. Significant progress has been made. The goal of universal ratification was 
incorporated in the United Nations policy agenda, including the Global Plan of Action to 
Combat Trafficking in Persons7 and the Roadmap adopted by The Hague Global Child 
Labour Conference.8  Commitment to ratification and implementation of the Protocol was 
also expressed by regional organizations and political groupings, including the 
Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the League of Arab States, MERCOSUR, the South 
Asian Initiative to End Violence against Children and States from the Asia and Pacific 
region. The Council of Europe launched a wide information campaign against sexual 
violence of children within which the ratification of the Optional Protocol is a core 
component.  
</p>
<p>  
 7 Adopted by General Assembly resolution 64/293; see in particular paragraph 4 of the Global Plan of 
</p>
<p>Action. 
 8 Roadmap for Achieving the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour by 2016, adopted on 11 
</p>
<p>May 2010. </p>


<p>39. Since the launch of the campaign, 14 States have ratified the Optional Protocol &#8211; 
C&#244;te d&#8216;Ivoire, Djibouti, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Jamaica, Luxembourg, Malta, 
Mauritius, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, San Marino and Saudi Arabia. The Central 
African Republic and Saint Lucia have signed.  
</p>
<p>40. To accelerate progress, in May 2011 the Special Representative, in collaboration 
with strategic partners, hosted a treaty event in New York, on the occasion of the first 
anniversary of the launch of the campaign, and supported a regional event hosted by the 
African Union with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), 
UNICEF and OHCHR, in Addis Ababa. The Commonwealth Heads of Government 
Meeting in Australia in October 2011 called on members to become parties to all major 
human rights instruments. In these and other high level meetings, the campaign received 
strong support from Governments, United Nations agencies, as well as parliamentarians, 
Ombuds for children, faith-based organizations and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>41. At least 21 States have made formal commitments to the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol, including in the framework of the universal periodic review of the Human Rights 
Council and before the Committee on the Rights of the Child or human rights mandate 
holders. Of those not yet parties to the Protocol, 50 per cent have ratified to the Palermo 
Protocol on Trafficking in Human Persons, and 75 per cent to ILO Convention No. 182 on 
the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which address similar areas of concern. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Conducting a global survey to assess progress in the prevention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>elimination of all forms of violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>42. The year 2011 marked the middle of the Special Representative&#8216;s mandate and five 
years since the review of the Study by the General Assembly, presenting a strategic 
occasion to gain perspective on progress achieved, boost efforts to overcome challenges 
and generate renewed energy towards children&#8216;s protection from violence. For this reason, 
the Special Representative launched a global survey to map and assess progress in the 
implementation of the Study recommendations. The survey was developed in close 
collaboration with a wide range of partners, including governments, United Nations 
agencies, regional organizations and institutions, and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>43. Children and young people are also important partners in this process, as they have 
been in the Study development and follow-up. To capture their views and 
recommendations, and build upon their active participation in regional consultations and 
regional governance structures, the Special Representative promoted, in close collaboration 
with civil society partners, the development a child-friendly version of the survey to frame 
discussions with young people in different regions. 
</p>
<p>44. The global survey also builds upon the significant analytical reviews conducted at 
the regional level, including by the League of Arab States, SAIEVAC, MERCOSUR and 
Central American countries. It draws upon United Nations and international monitoring 
processes, including the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council, reporting 
to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty bodies, and the follow-up to 
the World Congresses against Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents and the 
Roadmap for Achieving the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour by 2016, 
adopted by The Hague Global Child Labour Conference in 2010. 
</p>
<p>45. Contributions to the survey will feed into the Special Representative&#8216;s analytical 
report which she will present to the General Assembly in 2012. This report will inform the 
mandate&#8216;s review and the shaping of a forward-looking strategy to accelerate progress and 
re-energize national, regional and international action. </p>


<p><b> C. Widening awareness and advocacy to prevent and address violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against children in schools and in justice related institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Preventing and addressing violence against children in schools 
</b></p>
<p>46. Education has a unique potential to generate an environment where attitudes 
condoning violence can be changed and non-violent behaviour can be learned. Schools are 
well placed to break patterns of violence and provide skills to communicate, to negotiate 
and support peaceful solutions to conflicts. However, this potential is in marked contrast 
with the daily reality of millions of children. Within and around educational settings, both 
girls and boys continue to be exposed to violence, including verbal abuse, intimidation, 
physical aggression, and in some cases sexual abuse. At times they are also victims of gang 
violence and assault.   
</p>
<p>47. Recognizing the crucial importance of education in safeguarding children&#8216;s rights, 
and of violent-free schools as catalysts for non-violence in the communities that they serve, 
the Special Representative, in cooperation with the Government of Norway and the Council 
of Europe, organized in June 2011 in Oslo, an expert consultation with the participation of 
policy makers, education and child rights experts, civil society organizations and academics 
from different regions of the world, as well as United Nations agencies. The lessons and 
recommendations from the meeting will be addressed in the Special Representative&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>forthcoming publication entitled <i>Tackling Violence in Schools: a global perspective</i>. 
</p>
<p>48. The consultation stressed the importance of preventing and responding to violence in 
schools through a multidimensional strategy, which should take particularly into account 
the priority dimensions set out below. </p>
<p><i>  Promoting holistic, participatory and child-centred strategies 
</i></p>
<p>49. Schools are an inherent part of the communities in which they are located; violence 
in the school mirrors social attitudes condoning violence, and reflects the environment 
surrounding the school, including social unrest, availability of weapons and criminal gang 
activities. Hence, efforts to bring an end to violence in school must not only invest in 
securing a safe and child-friendly environment inside education settings, but also seek to 
address the cultural acceptance of violence against children, and invest in violence 
prevention and positive discipline initiatives for families and the community at large.  
</p>
<p>50. Schools succeed better in their efforts to curb violence particularly when they break 
away from a strictly sectoral approach<b> </b>in favour of holistic, participatory and child-centred 
strategies. Such strategies help to involve families in school life and children as crucial 
actors and agents of change, shaping decisions with their perspectives and experience. 
Furthermore, these strategies help to operate in a multifaceted way, by investing in teacher 
and school staff training, curricula development, school administration, policy 
development, budgetary allocations and strong legislation to secure children&#8216;s protection 
from violence.  
</p>
<p>51. This whole-school ethos was evident in the experiences shared at the Oslo meeting, 
including those designed to prevent bullying in schools. The success of these initiatives has 
been closely associated with the engagement of teachers, staff and students, as well as 
parents and members of the community. The reduction of incidents of bullying has equally 
been dependent on a strategic combination of factors, namely: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sincere commitment to address this phenomenon, with the formal adoption and wide 
dissemination of anti-bullying rules, and their launch though an official school 
event;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The creation of a governance system in which all stakeholders participate; </p>


<p>&#8226; The development of a monitoring system, through which incidents and issues of 
concern are periodically reviewed; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The dissemination of anti-bullying messages in the community at large.  
</p>
<p>The lessons learned from anti-bullying programmes provide a crucial reference to address 
other forms of violence in schools. 
</p>
<p><i>  Partnering with children 
</i></p>
<p>52. School- and system-wide interventions encourage change in attitudes and social 
norms that condone violence, including its use as a form of discipline. They also help to 
promote a culture of tolerance, respect and non-violence and as a result, prevent violence, 
help to reduce school absenteeism and drop-outs, improve academic achievement, and 
enhance children&#8216;s social skills and well-being.  It is critical to partner with children: it 
helps to counter the invisibility of violence, understand children&#8216;s perceptions, empower 
them to be the first line of prevention, and enhance the overall effectiveness of efforts 
aiming at the elimination of violence in its different forms. To support this, it is critical to 
promote a child-friendly school environment and relevant curricula, focusing on life skills 
and human rights education, and to nurture values of social equality, tolerance toward 
diversity and non-violent means of resolving conflict. 
</p>
<p>53. For vulnerable groups of children, including girls, children with disabilities, children 
belonging to minorities or indigenous groups, or affected by HIV, these efforts need to be 
redoubled.  They face particular challenges in gaining access to schooling and in remaining 
in school. They are more likely to be subjected to violence, or disregarded when they seek 
advice or report incidents of violence. As a result, they may end up choosing not to report 
violence for fear of drawing attention.  
</p>
<p><i>  Supporting teachers and school staff with necessary skill and resources 
</i></p>
<p>54. Teachers and school staff are decisive actors in violence prevention and responses. It 
is essential to provide them with the necessary skills, support and resources. It helps to 
equip staff to use constructive discipline methods in school, partner with students in 
violence prevention, serve as positive models, learn about peaceful conflict mediation and 
resolution, and promote school-safety mechanisms, such as codes of conduct and student-
friendly reporting mechanisms. Equally important is the provision of clear guidance on the 
handling of incidents of violence, mandatory reporting and assistance to child victims. 
Steps such as these are vital to enable the school to identify early signals of violence, 
support children at special risk and provide timely and effective support in an ethical and 
child-sensitive manner.  
</p>
<p><i>  Consolidating data and research on violence in schools 
</i></p>
<p>55. Although statistical information on violence in education is scarce and fragmented, 
available data reveal the serious magnitude and the long-lasting consequences of this 
phenomenon &#8211; on children and their families and on the education system as a whole. 
Surveys conducted in a number of countries confirm this pattern and in some cases helped 
to denounce emerging forms of violence, including new forms of sexual abuse in schools 
referred to as &#8213;sex for grades&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>56. Urgent efforts remain essential, including to capture the hidden face of violence and 
address its root causes; to understand perceptions and attitudes, including amongst girls and 
boys of different ages and social backgrounds; to help identify children at greater risk and 
effectively support them; and to assess the economic cost of violence and the social return 
that may be achieved with investment in prevention. </p>


<p> Securing children&#8217;s legal protection from violence in schools </p>
<p>57. The effectiveness of measures to deter and eliminate violence in schools is 
significantly undermined without a supportive legal framework. As mentioned elsewhere in 
this report, clear, unambiguous legislation that prohibits all forms of violence and protects 
children therefrom including within the school is a key dimension of any comprehensive 
strategy on violence against children. 
</p>
<p>58. In the majority of countries, violence in schools, including the ill-treatment and 
beating of children, is considered unlawful and punished with disciplinary measures. When 
some more serious forms of violence occur, such as sexual harassment or abuse, the 
outcome may be the dismissal and prosecution of those found responsible. Over the recent 
past, the number of states introducing legislation to prevent bullying, physical punishment 
and mental harassment of children within the school system has continued to rise. However, 
the legal prohibition of violence against children in schools is not yet a reality in 80 
countries around the world. And overall, the gap between legislation and the prevailing 
practice remains wide and challenging. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Preventing and addressing violence against children in justice related institutions 
</b></p>
<p>59. As noted in previous reports, preventing and addressing violence against children in 
the administration of justice constitutes a priority concern for the Special Representative. A 
justice system based on respect for the rights of the child is critical for the prevention of 
violence against children. It is indispensable to safeguard children&#8216;s right to access to 
justice and to participation in administrative and judicial proceedings which they 
understand and can effectively use, and to consolidate a child-friendly and non-intimidating 
justice environment within which children&#8216;s protection from violence can be guaranteed at 
all times, including in cases of deprivation of liberty.   
</p>
<p>60. The international community has developed a sound normative foundation to guide 
national implementation efforts in the area of the administration of juvenile justice. These 
include measures to prevent juvenile delinquency and ban children&#8216;s arbitrary and unlawful 
</p>
<p>detention; to ensure that deprivation of liberty of persons below 18 is used only as a 
measure of last resort and for the shortest period of time possible; to establish legal 
safeguards to guide children&#8216;s involvement with criminal proceedings; and to promote 
approaches which respect children&#8216;s dignity and invest in their education and social 
reintegration. 
</p>
<p>61. For many children around the world, the gap between these principles and reality 
remains a dramatic challenge. Deprivation of liberty affects thousands of children, often as 
a preferred or only option, rather than a measure of last resort. Pretrial detention can last for 
months or years, in some cases never leading to conviction. Children can be kept in 
detention for long periods of time, in overcrowded and appalling conditions, at times placed 
together with adults and facing risks of neglect and abuse. In many cases they are deprived 
of education and vocational initiatives and have limited opportunities to interact with other 
people of their age and to keep in contact with their families. A child can be exposed to 
violence since the moment of arrest, during transfers in police vehicles and while in police 
custody. Violence can equally affect the child during pretrial detention and after conviction, 
including when it is used as a form of control, discipline and punishment.  
</p>
<p>62. In a number of countries, juvenile justice remains an important gap in efforts to align 
the national normative framework with international standards. As a result, the minimum 
age of criminal responsibility is at times too low, adults&#8216; proceedings are applicable to 
children accused of committing an offence, and in a number of countries sentencing of 
persons below 18 can include capital punishment, life imprisonment, stoning, canning, 
flogging and amputation.  </p>


<p>63. Still too often, the criminal justice system ends up being used as a substitute for 
weak child protection institutions, in turn further stigmatizing vulnerable groups of 
children, including those who are homeless and poor, or have run away from home as a 
result of violence. As highlighted by the work of the Human Rights Council, marginalized 
and socially excluded children, including those living and/or working on the street, need to 
be protected from violence, stigmatization and discrimination. Survival behaviours, such as 
begging, vagrancy, truancy or running away, need to be dealt with as protection concerns, 
rather than through punitive measures. Overall, it remains critical to end the criminalization 
of marginalized children, as well as the impunity for crimes committed against them.  
</p>
<p>64. These concerns were also high in the agenda of the Kampala Conference on Child 
Justice in Africa, organized in November 2011 by the Africa Child Policy Forum and 
Defence for Children International with the support of the Government of Uganda and in 
which the Special Representative participated. The meeting included the participation of 
government officials and civil society representatives from 35 countries. The Munyonyo 
Declaration and its Call for Action,9 adopted by the meeting, will be a key reference for 
future action. 
</p>
<p>65. The Kampala Conference also produced a set of Guidelines on Action for Children 
in the Justice System in Africa.10 The Guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for 
the development of safe and child-friendly justice systems, covering all procedures of an 
administrative or judicial nature, whether formal or informal, including traditional systems.  
</p>
<p>66. In January 2012 the Special Representative will organize with UNODC, OHCHR 
and the Government of Austria an expert consultation on the prevention of violence against 
children within the justice system.  Framed by international standards on juvenile justice, 
the consultation offers an important platform to present and reflect on national and 
international initiatives which can help to identify and address risk and contributing factors 
to violence within the juvenile justice system, and promote strategies and measures to 
prevent violence and strengthening children&#8216;s effective protection there from. The Expert 
Consultation conclusions and recommendations will feed into the thematic debate in 
Human Rights Council on the rights of children involved in the justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Strengthening the institutionalization of regional processes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance structures in support of national efforts to prevent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>address violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>67. The collaboration with regional organizations and institutions is a cornerstone of the 
Special Representative&#8216;s strategy to accelerate progress in the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Study. These partnerships have been crucial to develop policy 
platforms to capture positive developments, identify concerns and challenges, and mobilize 
action to safeguard children&#8216;s right to freedom from violence.   
</p>
<p>68. Noticeable progress has been made in this regard, with the development of regional 
agendas on follow-up to the Study, the institutionalization of regional governance 
structures, and the adoption of significant political commitments towards violence 
prevention and elimination.  A compilation of these declarations and strategies is included 
in the annex to this report.  
</p>
<p>69. To take stock and reflect upon the significant process of change promoted by these 
regional initiatives and mechanisms, and strengthen cross-regional cooperation, the Special

<p>Representative hosted a High-Level Round Table in October 2011, in New York, on the 
occasion of the General Assembly debate on the rights of the child. The meeting was 
organized in collaboration with the League of Arab States, SAIEVAC, the MERCOSUR 
Pro-Tempore Permanent Commission of Nin@Sur, the Council of Europe, the African 
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and UNICEF. The Special 
Representative launched on this occasion the publication <i>Political Commitments by 
Regional Organizations and Institutions to prevent and Address Violence against Children</i>, 
containing the most significant political declarations and strategies adopted across regions 
to protect children from all forms of violence. In some cases they establish a navigation 
chart for achieving progress and a monitoring mechanism to oversee implementation and 
galvanize efforts to overcome challenges.  
</p>
<p>70.  During the Round Table, insightful regional studies and analytical reviews 
conducted on the process of implementation of the Study were also launched, including the 
League of Arab States&#8216; &#8213;Comparative Arab Report on implementing the recommendations 
of the UN Secretary-General&#8216;s Study on Violence against Children&#8214;, and the Council of 
Europe&#8216;s report &#8213;Keys to protect children against violence&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>71. The Round Table was the first of its kind and became a platform to reflect on 
lessons learnt and support the development of a forward-looking strategy to prevent and 
eliminate violence against children at the regional and national levels. As highlighted by the 
Deputy Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, &#8213;combining the various efforts of 
regional organizations with the critical contribution of the UN family is the best chance we 
have to create a world fit for children&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>72. The Round Table launched a process of institutional cooperation amongst regional 
mechanisms and institutions, including South-South cooperation to consolidate the 
protection of children from violence worldwide. Participating organizations and institutions 
adopted an important Joint Statement which recognizes their decisive commitment to:  
</p>
<p> (a) Enhance cooperation and promote the sharing of national experiences, good 
practices and lessons learned on the process of implementation of the Study; 
</p>
<p> (b) Support initiatives for exchanging of regional experiences; 
</p>
<p> (c) Promote the development, under the auspices of the Special Representative&#8216;s 
office, of an information hub for knowledge-sharing and access to information; 
</p>
<p> (d) Strengthen cooperation with key stakeholders, including independent 
institutions on the rights of the child, parliamentarians, civil society, including children, 
religious leaders, the private sector and the media; 
</p>
<p> (e) Develop initiatives to build a culture of respect for children&#8216;s rights and 
protection from violence, including through enhanced partnerships with the media; and 
</p>
<p> (f) Support the Special Representative and global efforts to prevent and address 
violence against children.  
</p>
<p>73. The regional process of follow up to the Study has continued to strengthen further. 
On the one hand, through the holding of periodic meetings to review progress achieved, as 
was the case in September 2011, in Nepal, by SAIEVAC, which has since been recognized 
as an Apex Body of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC); in 
October by the League of Arab States in Doha; and in December by the Permanent 
Commission of the Initiative Nin@Sur in Montevideo. One the other hand, through the 
extension and further development of existing strategies, as was the case of the Council of 
Europe meeting in Monaco, &#8213;Building a child-friendly Europe: turning a vision into 
reality&#8214;, held in November 2011.   </p>


<p>74. Similarly, in a number of countries, including the Plurinational State of Bolivia and 
Belize, national follow-up consultations were held on the implementation of the Study 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>75. In early December, representatives from Central American countries, Mexico and 
Cuba met in a regional consultation in Santo Domingo. The meeting was hosted by the 
Government of the Dominican Republic in cooperation with the Office of the Special 
Representative and the Latin American Chapter of the Global Movement for Children. It 
included the participation of national institutions and authorities on children and 
adolescents, international and regional human rights bodies, United Nations agencies, civil 
society organizations, the media, and young representatives.  
</p>
<p>76. The consultation was framed by an analytical regional mapping of national 
implementation measures for children&#8216;s protection from violence. The discussions 
</p>
<p>addressed national experiences and positive developments, critical challenges and emerging 
concerns, and anticipated areas where further progress is required. In view of its particular 
relevance for the region, special emphasis was placed on children&#8216;s protection from 
violence in the criminal justice system, and on children&#8216;s vulnerability as a result of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and migration. The Santo Domingo Declaration adopted by the meeting 
reaffirms the commitment to pursue implementation of the Study recommendations.  
</p>
<p>77. Building upon the consultations held in Paraguay and the Dominican Republic, 
respectively for South American and Central American countries, a Caribbean regional 
meeting will be held in May 2012 in Jamaica.  
</p>
<p>78. Initiatives were equally promoted in 2011 with the African Union Commissioner for 
Social Affairs and the African Committee on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. These 
include a conference in Addis Ababa to support the universal ratification of the Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other child rights treaties; and a 
technical workshop in Burkina Faso on legislative reform to strengthen children&#8216;s 
protection from violence in all its forms, including corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Day of the African Child</b> 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative joined the commemoration of the 2011 Day of the African 
Child, devoted to the theme &#8213;All together for urgent actions in favour of street children&#8214;.  
The Day highlighted the significant challenges encountered by children living and working 
in the streets in Africa, including their vulnerability to violence. It was a strategic occasion 
to join the African Committee in calling for the establishment of widely publicized, 
accessible, safe and child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms; for 
national investment in child-protection systems with legislation banning all forms of 
violence against children; and for the abolition of status offences and criminalization of 
survival behaviour, such as begging, truancy or vagrancy. 
 </p>


<p><b> IV. Strategic partnerships to accelerate progress in violence 
prevention and elimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Enhancing partnerships with Governments and within the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Representative remains strongly committed to further strengthening 
strategic alliances for the protection of children from all forms of violence, within and 
beyond the United Nations system.  
</p>
<p>80. Direct engagement with Governments and other national stakeholders has been a 
key dimension of the process. In the first two years of her mandate, she conducted over 50 
missions in all regions, and visited 39 countries to support national initiatives and to bring 
the mandate close to national stakeholders and the public at large.11  
</p>
<p>81. Strategic cooperation with national authorities and stakeholders has been crucial to 
raising awareness of the impact of violence on the enjoyment of children&#8216;s rights, to 
support the development of comprehensive and integrated strategies on violence against 
children, to secure the legal protection of children, and to consolidate efforts to build sound 
data systems and a research agenda to enable governments to effectively prevent and 
address this child rights violation.  
</p>
<p>82. Institutional collaboration mechanisms have been established in support of the 
Special Representative&#8216;s mandate, including the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence 
against Children (IAWG), the NGO Advisory Council on Violence against Children, and, 
as mentioned above, with regional high-level governance structures.  
</p>
<p>83. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/141, the Special Representative 
cooperates closely with the United Nations system, including funds and programmes and 
specialized agencies, and human rights treaty bodies and mechanisms with responsibilities 
in the prevention and elimination of violence against children. Although with distinct but 
mutually supportive mandates, associating normative and operational agencies, all partners 
are united in a common human rights foundation and determined to build a world free from 
violence. This institutional collaboration has been crucial to raise awareness and broaden 
global support for children&#8216;s protection from violence, to promote the mainstreaming of this 
topic in United Nations activities, and to inform the policy agenda through the organization 
of strategic panel discussions with key partners.  
</p>
<p>84. As noted above in chapter II, further decisive steps have been taken with the Special 
Representative on Children and Armed Conflict and other critical allies to promote 
accelerated progress towards universal ratification of the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Representative hosted high-level policy discussions to promote the 
consideration of violence against children as a cross-cutting concern within the United 
Nations agenda, including on extreme poverty and violence, during the Commission on 
Social Development; on gender-based violence and girls&#8216; victimization on the occasion of 
the Commission on the Status of Women; and on violence against children with disabilities 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, China, Denmark, 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Morocco, 
Nepal, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Russian 
Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Republic of  
Tanzania,. Her office was represented at events in Mexico, South Africa and Uruguay. </p>


<p>during the General Assembly and the meeting of States Parties of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Strategic cooperation was also promoted with United 
Nations partners to curb violence in the community and minimize the impact of situations 
of armed and gang violence on children, including through policies that help to reduce 
availability of and access to small arms.  
</p>
<p>86. At the special event convened in the lead-up to the General Assembly thematic 
debate on the rights of children with disabilities, the high risks of physical, emotional and 
sexual violence endured by these children were given special attention. The debate 
reaffirmed the following priorities: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All countries need to enact legislation banning all forms of violence against all 
children, including those with disabilities;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is urgent to establish in all countries effective and well-resourced child and 
disability sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms to prevent and 
address incidents of violence;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is essential to invest in awareness and information to break the silence around 
violence against children with disabilities, and develop sound data system and 
research on child disability and the forms and prevalence of violence to safeguard 
children&#8216;s enjoyment of their rights. 
</p>
<p>87. The periodic meetings of the IAWG have remained a crucial forum for consultation, 
policy formulation and mainstreaming of violence against children within the United 
Nations agenda, including in the consolidation of data and research to end the invisibility 
and social acceptance of violence and inform strategic advocacy, policy development and 
resource mobilization to prevent and eliminate this phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>88. The Special Representative&#8216;s office participated in the 5th Milestones of a Global 
Campaign for Violence Prevention Meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, in September 
2011, organized by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Conference presented new 
evidence on effective interventions to prevent interpersonal violence and promote increased 
collaboration across sectors and disciplines, including health, social protection and criminal 
justice. The results of the meeting will be an important resource for the upcoming expert 
consultation on better data and research on violence against children.  
</p>
<p>89. The Violence Prevention Alliance, in which the Special Representative participates, 
brings together a network of WHO member States, international agencies, academia and 
civil society organizations. Partners from all sectors (governmental, non-governmental and 
private) are united around a shared vision to address the root causes of violence and to 
improve services for victims.12 The Special Representative&#8216;s participation in the Alliance 
opens avenues to significantly enhance the visibility of violence against children and 
contribute to relevant initiatives and publications.  
</p>
<p>90. The collaboration with human rights treaty bodies and mechanisms continued to 
feature highly on the Special Representative&#8216;s agenda to capitalize on synergies across 
mandates and to mainstream concerns on violence against children in all relevant mandates. 
Periodic discussions and joint initiatives have been pursued with the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, opening avenues to contribute to and build upon the Committee&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>concluding observations, thematic debates and general comments. Collaboration in the 
development of general comment No. 13 on the right to freedom from violence,13 and the

<p>drafting process of the new optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
are illustrations of this critical partnership. 
</p>
<p>91. The participation in the annual meeting of Special Rapporteurs, Representatives, 
independent experts and Chairs of Working Groups of the special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council has been instrumental to share information and identify opportunities for 
joint activities to address the root causes and risk factors of violence, and to empower 
children and young people and support the building of a culture of non-violence. The joint 
report with the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography on child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaint mechanisms confirms 
the potential of this strategic cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Consolidating cooperation with civil society organizations and young 
</b></p>
<p><b>people 
</b></p>
<p>92. Civil society actors play a decisive role in the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Study and they have been critical in regional processes and expert 
discussions.  Collaboration with civil society partners has been instrumental to the global 
campaign for the universal ratification of the Optional Protocols to the Convention, for 
scaling up legal reform initiatives, for promoting the participation of children, for raising 
awareness about the incidence and negative impact of violence on children&#8216;s rights, and for 
</p>
<p>advocating in favour of initiatives designed to prevent children&#8216;s exposure to violence in 
schools, care and justice institutions, in the community, labour settings or within the home. 
Cooperation has been greatly facilitated by the establishment of the NGO Advisory 
Council, and its advocacy and social mobilization efforts with partners at the international, 
regional and national levels.  
</p>
<p>93. In October 2011, the Special representative joined the launch of the NGO Advisory 
Council&#8216;s report entitled Five Years On: A global update on violence against children. The 
report surveyed over 100 studies conducted by academic researchers, non-governmental 
organizations and United Nations agencies since 2006. The report recognizes progress and 
numerous commitments and promises made for violence prevention and elimination, but 
also presents evidence of how millions of children continue to be humiliated, beaten, 
burned, sexually abused and even killed. The report is a valuable contribution to the 
knowledge base about violence against and children and to the shaping of a future agenda 
for action.  
</p>
<p>94. Strategic collaboration was further strengthened with the NGO Group for the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Working Group on Violence against 
Children, as well as with Child Helpline International and its network. Present in more than 
120 countries, child helplines play an invaluable role in children&#8216;s protection from violence, 
</p>
<p>which is the main reason why children contact helplines around the world. Helplines are a 
crucial part of child-sensitive mechanisms and an indispensable source of information on 
violence-related questions.  
</p>
<p>95. The year 2011 saw strengthened collaboration with faith-based organizations. 
Religious leaders were decisive and influential allies in the development of the Study and 
have remained key partners in the process of follow up, fostering dialogue, promoting 
change in practices that perpetuate violence against children, and encouraging the use of 
non-violent forms of discipline. To strengthen these efforts, the Special Representative 
developed a strategic partnership with the World Day of Prayer and Action for Children, a 
global movement of religious leaders and communities of all faiths and secular 
organizations who are committed to the promotion of children&#8216;s rights. The World Day is 
</p>
<p>celebrated annually around 20 November, the anniversary of the adoption of the </p>


<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child and is an opportunity for religious leaders and faith-
based institutions to join hands with governments and inter-governmental organizations, 
civil society &#8211; including parents, teachers and young people &#8211; to promote the child&#8216;s 
physical, social, psychological and spiritual development.  
</p>
<p>96. From 2011 and over three years, the World Day is devoted to ending violence 
against children. In 2011, World Day partners, including UNICEF, organized 85 activities 
in 70 countries in commemoration of the World Day of Prayer and Action for Children.  
For instance, in the Dominican Republic over 70 faith-based organizations and child rights 
advocates gathered behind an Interreligious Declaration calling for enhanced efforts to 
implement the recommendations of the Study and highlighting religious leaders 
commitment to promote non-violence, the protection of children from violence in their 
communities, and non-violent discipline within the home. The Declaration was officially 
presented to the Special Representative in the framework of the Central American regional 
meeting on Violence against Children, held in Santo Domingo on 2 December 2011. 
</p>
<p>97. The Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, the Churches&#8216; 
Network for Non-Violence and Save the Children Sweden in 2011 published a valuable 
handbook to help those working with and within religious communities to harness faith-
based support for reform to end corporal punishment of children. The handbook, entitled 
&#8213;Ending corporal punishment of children: A handbook for working with and within 
religious communities&#8214;<i>, </i>contains valuable examples of faith-based initiatives and resources 
for engaging with religious leaders and organizations and developing multi-religious 
support and partnership at every level.  
</p>
<p><i>  Cooperation with young people 
</i></p>
<p>98. Child participation is a core dimension of the Special Representative&#8216;s mandate. 
Cooperation and meetings with children and young people take place regularly, including 
during the Special Representative&#8216;s regional initiatives and field missions, and the child-
friendly space on her website continues to be further developed. 
</p>
<p>99. As noted above, the Global Survey launched by the Special Representative is being 
conducted with the involvement of children. In support of this process, a child-friendly 
version of the survey has been developed in close cooperation with civil society partners, 
and a number of consultations are being held at the regional level with young people. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Children&#8217;s consultation in South Asia on the Global Survey 
</p>
<p>A regional Children&#8216;s Consultation was held in Kathmandu in September 2011, to discuss 
the global survey. Child representatives from eight South Asian countries acknowledged 
positive developments but recommended the further strengthening of the role of 
Governments. They called for increased awareness-raising programmes, in particular at the 
community level, the promotion of good parenting skills, and the prohibition by law of all 
forms of violence against children. They recognized the importance of promoting child 
participation and establishing child clubs and youth consultations forums to promote 
awareness about violence against children. Children recommended that child helplines be 
made available to all children, and that child protection services be provided with an 
adequate number of trained professionals. School counsellors and police desks for women 
and children were identified as good practices. Children also called for special training for 
teachers on non-violent teaching methods, in addition to strict regulations prohibiting the 
use of violence in education. 
 </p>


<p>100. As acknowledged by surveys of children across regions, violence constitutes a key 
matter of concern for them. But in spite of the serious and long-lasting impact of violence 
in their daily lives, children show remarkable resilience and a unique ability to mobilize to 
promote non-violence and peaceful solutions, including by raising awareness amongst 
children and their families about violence and its impact, generating solidarity and support 
for child victims, and instilling confidence to report incidents of violence. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Looking ahead 
</b></p>
<p>101. The past two years of the mandate have helped to build momentum on violence 
prevention and its elimination at the national, regional and international levels. As captured 
by this report, violence against children is generating growing concern and action, and 
leading to advocacy and social mobilization initiatives by a wide alliance of partners, and 
supported by international and regional organizations.  
</p>
<p>102. This momentum has been accompanied by concrete achievements, including 
national legislative and policy measures to protect children from violence, a more targeted 
approach by United Nations agencies and mechanisms to mainstream violence against 
children in the policy agenda, and a process of institutionalization of the follow-up to the 
recommendations of the Study by regional organizations and political groupings, and civil 
society actors. 
</p>
<p>103. These developments provide much hope for progress, but it remains urgent to 
translate the vision of the Study into reality. 2012 is a particularly strategic time to 
accelerate efforts, as it marks the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and of the commitments made at 
the General Assembly Special Session on Children on violence against children. It is also 
the year during which the General Assembly will review the Special Representative&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>mandate and re-energize efforts to build a world free from violence. Pressed by the urgency 
of this cause and by the unique potential offered by this auspicious year, the Special 
Representative will place particular attention on the areas set out below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening international commitment</b>s to children&#8217;s protection from 
<b>violence, including through the promotion of the universal ratification 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The wide expression of support for the global campaign for the universal 
ratification of the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the progress achieved are evidence of the value of this joint United Nations initiative. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The year 2012 can become a milestone in the achievement of universal ratification and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Representative will continue to give priority attention to this goal. In view 
</b></p>
<p><b>of </b>the General Assembly&#8217;s adoption of <b>the Optional Protocol on a communications 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure, efforts will also be directed towards its swift signature and entry into force.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Enhancing awareness and knowledge </b>of children&#8217;s exposure to violence 
<b>to support effective action for violence prevention and elimination 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Violence knows no geographic, social or cultural borders; it is widespread and 
occurs in all contexts, including where children are expected to enjoy special 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection. To gain deeper understanding of the root causes and risk factors of this 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomenon, and identify positive experiences and strategic recommendations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>assist governments in their national implementation efforts, the Special </b></p>


<p><b>Representative will pursue her series of thematic expert consultations on priority 
</b></p>
<p><b>topics. These include the prevention of violence against children within the juvenile 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice system, and data and research on violence against children. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Mainstreaming the Study recommendations in the national agenda and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening partnerships with regional organizations and institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>in support of this process 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The effective follow-up to the Study recommendations is largely dependent on 
the extent to which they are mainstreamed into the national policy and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework, and become a central topic of concern in the public debate. Through her 
</b></p>
<p><b>global advocacy, policy dialogue and field missions, the Special Representative will 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to support national implementation efforts, particularly those designed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>put in place well-coordinated and resourced national agendas on violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; legislation prohibiting all forms of violence against children in all settings; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sound data and research on the forms, incidence and magnitude of violence. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>To consolidate knowledge and advance progress, she will consolidate further 
the strategic partnerships developed with regional organizations and institutions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>will host regional consultations in 2012, including in South Asia and in the Caribbean. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Conducting a global survey to assess progress in the prevention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>elimination of all forms of violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>As noted above, the Special Representative launched a global survey to map 
and assess progress in the implementation of the Study recommendations. Its 
</b></p>
<p><b>outcomes will inform her report to the General Assembly, in 2012, and the shaping of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a forward-looking agenda which can sustain the momentum of achievements made 
</b></p>
<p><b>and promote a paradigm shift in the protection of children from violence.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Despite progress achieved, the urgency of this cause has not diminished. In a 
world plagued by deep economic crisis and social unrest, it is imperative to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>the risk of dilution of the agenda on violence against children in the face of competing 
</b></p>
<p><b>priorities. A sustained and coordinated effort remains essential to transform the 
</b></p>
<p><b>current achievements into a quantum leap forward!  The Special Representative looks 
</b></p>
<p><b>forward to continuing to collaborate closely with Member States and all other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders to achieve this important goal. </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Political commitments by regional organizations and 
institutions to prevent and address violence against children 
in the framework of the process of follow-up to the 
recommendations of the United Nations Study on Violence 
against Children

<p>  <b>Santo Domingo Declaration, Follow-up meeting for Central 
America, Cuba, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, 
December 2011 
</b></p>
<p>We, the governmental and state authorities, representatives of the civil society and national 
human rights institutions, children and adolescents and international organizations from 
Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and the 
Dominican Republic; as well as representatives of the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, have met in Santo Domingo, 
Dominican Republic on 1 and 2 December 2011 during the Central American Chapter 
Follow-up Meeting to the United Nations Study on Violence against Children, organized by 
the Government of the Dominican Republic as host country and by the Latin American 
Chapter of the Global Movement for Children (GMC),   in close collaboration with the 
Office of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children, Ms. Marta Santos Pais. 
</p>
<p>Five years after the presentation of the Global Study on Violence against Children and its 
recommendations before the United Nations General Assembly, the participants of the 
Central American follow-up meeting have decided to drive a process to communicate and 
evaluate the implementation of the Study recommendations, including the development of a 
mapping of the advances promoted by states, the celebration of this sub-regional meeting in 
Santo Domingo; as well as, support for the establishment of national and regional 
monitoring of the execution/accomplishment of these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The meeting provided an opportunity to disseminate the Study on Violence against 
Children and to track prioritized Recommendations 1, 2 and 11at regional and national 
levels, renewing the political commitment of the participating States, promoting the 
exchange of experiences and the reinforcement of sub-regional cooperation areas, based on 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by all participating States. 
</p>
<p>During the presentations, panels and group work were identified the challenges, 
opportunities and future actions to develop strategies, policies and national programs that 
prioritize the prevention and prohibition of all forms of violence against children and 
adolescents and the creation and implementation of national systems of data collection, 
information and research. 
</p>
<p>In particular, the involvement of children and adolescents has provided important inputs so 
the right to a life without violence can be a reality. 
</p>
<p>This statement will be complemented by the guidelines for a regional roadmap in light of 
the priorities identified by participating countries, whose value is to support the regional 
process, the debate and the formulation of national roadmaps.  These roadmaps will be 
appropriate to the contexts and structures of regional institutions and specific to each State, 
and prepared with the active participation of all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>We recognize that the elimination of violence against children is a major challenge, which 
requires a sustained and coordinated effort from governmental institutions, legislature, civil 
society, international agencies, and independent human rights institutions as well as from 
individual children and adolescents in order to be achieved. 
</p>
<p>We recognize the importance of facilitating and supporting opportunities for dialogue and 
coordination at national and regional levels that can help meet the goals established in the 
United Nations Global Study on Violence against Children. </p>


<p><b>  Roadmap to contribute to the realization of the right of all 
boys, girls and adolescents to protection against all forms of 
violence in South America, Asunci&#243;n, April 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>The South American Meeting for Follow-up to the Recommendations of the United Nations 
Study on Violence against Children was held in Asunci&#243;n, Paraguay on 28 and 29 April 
</p><p>2011. The meeting was held to encourage more widespread dissemination of the report and 
to follow up on its recommendations on regional and national levels. It was also meant to 
raise awareness, promote the exchange of experiences and stimulate further progress in 
priority areas.  
</p>
<p>The meeting also sought to consolidate the strategic alliances of several key actors, 
including the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General (SRSG) on 
Violence against Children, Mrs. Marta Santos Pa&#237;s. The meeting prioritized strengthening 
institutional links with countries, United Nations bodies, international and regional 
organizations, and civil society groups, including the media and children and adolescents, 
with a focus on implementing Study recommendations.  
</p>
<p>The Study presented a series of recommendations focused on accelerating and monitoring 
progress in preventing and responding to violence, based on international human rights 
instruments. The mandate of the SRSG is to raise awareness and encourage implementation 
of the Study&#8216;s recommendations. This task is fundamental; it underscores the urgency of 
</p>
<p>tackling violence against children and adolescents, based on an effective approach and 
realistic priorities.  
</p>
<p>To support implementation of the Study&#8216;s recommendations in the Latin American and 
Caribbean region, the Global Movement for Children&#8211;Latin American and Caribbean 
Chapter (GMC&#8211;CLAC) partnered with the SRSG and the State of Paraguay to organize the 
meeting.  
</p>
<p>Prior to the event, a mapping exercise was conducted on implementation of the 
recommendations, emphasizing those prioritized by the SRSG. The mapping incorporated 
information from primary and secondary sources, and States and civil society organizations 
from throughout South America contributed valuable information. Groups of children and 
adolescents were also consulted, and their contributions were decisive in clarifying their 
perceptions of violence, their experiences and their proposals for how to comply with the 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>Based on information obtained during the mapping and the Asunci&#243;n meeting, and as a 
result of dialogue between the SRSG, the MERCOSUR Permanent Commission Ni&#241;@Sur 
and the top authorities for childhood and adolescence of MERCOSUR, on 26 April 2011, 
the following Roadmap was drafted to track progress on implementing the prioritized 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Proposals and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>To ensure a strategic and sustainable approach to application of the recommendations, the 
following actions are proposed: </p>


<p><b>  Use of the human rights framework as a frame of reference 
</b></p>
<p>Considering that protection of children and adolescents from violence is an ethical and 
human rights imperative, States are recommended to proceed with universal ratification of 
human rights treaties and to withdraw any reservations they may have declared in relation 
to these. They are also encouraged to support adoption of the Third Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, on individual complaints. 
</p>
<p>States are recommended to ensure their compliance with the decisions and 
recommendations issued by international and regional organs concerned with monitoring 
human rights. These include in particular the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and its Rapporteurship on the Rights of the 
Child, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Special attention is recommended to 
the Concluding Observations and General Comments of the Committee and the four 
thematic reports that have been published by the Commission&#8216;s Rapporteurship on the 
Rights of the Child: Citizen Security and Human Rights, Corporal Punishment and Human 
Rights of Children and Adolescents, The Rights of the Child in the Inter-American Human 
Rights System and Juvenile Justice and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Adoption of national legislation prohibiting all forms of violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>It is recommended that all States adopt an explicit national legal prohibition on all forms of 
violence against children, in all settings. This will send a clear message that all forms of 
violence against children and adolescents are inadmissible. The explicit prohibition on 
physical and humiliating punishment is essential, as is the withdrawal of some expressions 
currently found in legislation, including the term &#8215;moderate&#8216;, which continues to allow 
physical and humiliating punishment and introduces an element of discretion that is 
inconsistent with the rights of children and adolescents to their personal integrity and 
human dignity.  
</p>
<p>National legal frameworks must be reviewed and adapted to meet international standards 
and instruments. 
</p>
<p>National standards should clearly set out the competencies required for their regulatory 
development and the responsibility for their effective implementation and monitoring.  
</p>
<p>Participation by civil society and children and adolescents themselves must be taken into 
consideration in these legislative processes, particularly on issues affecting them, as 
established by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>Legislation must also allow for adequate mechanisms of implementation and guarantee 
advice and counselling as well as mechanisms for complaints and reporting of incidents of 
violence by children/adolescents or their representatives. 
</p>
<p>Legislation must cover the work of both public and private institutions. It should be used as 
the basis for developing regulations concerning these services, including standards of 
conduct and discipline and appropriate monitoring mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Application of laws must be complemented by initiatives to raise social awareness and 
mobilize the general public, particularly children and adolescents. In most cases this 
implies modifying deeply rooted social behaviours and creating conditions for a culture of 
respect for children's rights. Media dissemination plans are recommended to further this 
aim. Awareness-raising initiatives are also recommended for anyone who is in direct 
contact with children: parents, relatives, caregivers, teachers, social workers, civil servants 
employed in public institutions, civil society organizations that work with children and 
adolescents, the general public, public decision-makers and their advisers.  </p>


<p>Legislation must also establish mechanisms of supervision, investigation and compliance, 
always mindful of respect for human rights. Legislative provisions must be supported by 
initiatives to combat impunity for commission of violence and provision for adequate 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p>Legislation must also provide protection to victims and witnesses, including facilities for 
complaints and their redress and legal and psychological support to aid recovery and 
integration. Complaint mechanisms must be designed to be easily accessible by and 
specially adapted for children and adolescents, and to be confidential, safe, user-friendly 
and independent. Legal guarantees must be established to protect child victims and to 
prevent any risk of manipulation or reprisals.  
</p>
<p>Parliamentarians must organize debates to supervise and encourage follow-up of any 
legislative recommendations or reforms that may be necessary. They should also guarantee 
allocation of adequate resources for effective implementation of legislation. 
</p>
<p>It is of concern that some forms of violence are not yet prohibited or properly regulated by 
law, along with violence in certain settings, such as schools, family and community 
settings, and institutions of confinement. This includes specifically penalties against &#8215;client-
exploiters&#8216; of persons under 18 years of age who are sexually exploited. Regarding 
</p>
<p>prevention of institutional violence, it is important that guidelines include suitable 
guarantees regarding supervision and complaints. Impunity must also be combated by the 
State, subject to oversight by civil society. 
</p>
<p>In cases where children or adolescents commit unlawful acts, it is important that laws take 
into consideration the standards upheld by international human rights law. In particular, 
models of restorative and not merely punitive justice should be enacted, and the age limit 
for criminal responsibility should be established with maximum respect for children's rights 
as a whole. In all cases, regressive tendencies, including lowering the age of criminal 
responsibility, must be resisted. It should be borne in mind that confinement must be a 
measure of last resort, and for the shortest time possible. Particularly significant are 
concerns about reports of violations of human rights and rights of children and adolescents 
occurring in centres of confinement, where children/adolescents are under custody of the 
State and may suffer forms of violence.    
</p>
<p><b>  Institutionalization of a follow-</b>up process and application of the Study&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>Overcoming all forms of violence against children and adolescents requires a sustained 
effort over time and the joint work of many varied actors. Thus it is clearly necessary to 
institutionalize suitable and properly structured national and regional structures and 
processes for follow-up and application of the recommendations of the Study to achieve 
progress and ensure sustainable changes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Designation of a high-level authority in each country with the mandate to coordinate 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions necessary for implementation and follow-up of the Study 
</b></p>
<p>Confronting the phenomenon of violence requires an integrated and holistic approach. Such 
a multi-faceted and multi-causal issue linked to children's rights must be addressed from the 
perspective of promotion, prevention, protection and response if we are to break the cycle 
that reproduces violence, and not merely offer reactive responses. This type of intervention 
requires two kinds of coordination: horizontal (between sectors, including health, education 
and social affairs, gender, justice and home affairs, planning, economy and finance) and 
vertical (between local and national authorities).Thus, coordination must be led by a top-
level actor with the capacity to manage coordination and a mandate to call on diverse 
sectors and the various levels of government.  </p>


<p>It is recommended that a strategy be designed and mechanisms sought through which the 
recommendations can be incorporated into all spheres and levels of the State, at the same 
time ensuring effective and efficient vertical coordination. 
</p>
<p>Financial resources must be transferred from national to decentralized levels in accordance 
and consistent with responsibilities assigned, avoiding the creation of inequalities in access 
to prevention and protection anywhere within the territory. To achieve this without limiting 
compliance by a country, the clause addressing budget allocation in Recommendation 1 &#8211; 
&#8213;must be in accordance with the country's resources&#8214; &#8211; should be viewed in relative terms.  
</p>
<p><b>  Development of a wide-ranging national strategy to prevent and respond to all forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violence against children and adolescents 
</b></p>
<p>It is recommended that the recommendations of the Study be included in public policy 
planning instruments, both those of a general nature and those specifically designed for 
children. These should include national plans of action for children, national development 
plans, national human rights plans and other plans and programmes. These planning 
instruments must be given strategic objectives, with defined timelines and resource 
allocations that are adequate and sufficient in both financial and human terms. They should 
include follow-up indicators and regular evaluations of their results and impact. Reports of 
their activities should be presented annually to Parliament and the general public.  
</p>
<p>This strategy must be applied using high-level coordination, with management 
responsibility for organizing activities that span different government departments and 
political and administrative levels. This should take place in association with other relevant 
parties, in particular civil society organizations and other groups representing children and 
adolescents, as well as academic institutions. 
</p>
<p>These actions must be accompanied by a dissemination plan involving the media to ensure 
that the public has access to information on strategies for combating violence. The plan will 
also seek to contribute to changing the social mindset (entailing a social and cultural 
change) based on the key role of the media. This should be directed both at the general 
public and at anyone who takes political decisions, using appropriate, child-friendly 
language. The intention should be to strengthen the principles of transparency and public 
control. 
</p>
<p>From this viewpoint, based on the existing structural framework, spaces and mechanisms 
(and creating them if there are none), the following operational suggestions are made for 
dissemination of information: 
</p>
<p> 1. A coordination group should be created at national and regional levels 
specializing in the issue of violence, with a specific budget and the use of technologies to 
facilitate communication between specialists within the region.  
</p>
<p> 2. At country level, each representative should mobilize a process for drawing 
up a national plan (national roadmap), with a budget and involving the highest authorities, 
bearing in mind cultural diversity. This calls for forming committees for participation by 
different state actors, civil society and children and adolescents; establishing common goals 
and objectives; and dividing responsibilities to permit follow-up of actions and regular 
evaluation of results. Common results indicators are essential.  
</p>
<p><b>  Promotion of and support for the participation of children and adolescents 
</b></p>
<p>It is fundamentally important to encourage participation by children and adolescents in the 
follow-up to the Study. Their ideas and experiences should be valued and considered. 
Appropriate conditions should be established for them to act within their own communities, 
including a mechanism for their own protection. It is therefore recommended that a </p>


<p>communications strategy be established, with children and adolescents participating in its 
conception and design, using child-friendly materials that take diversity into account.   
</p>
<p>At the same time, approaches adapted to children/adolescents should be promoted in both 
prevention and response, thus increasing accessibility for children/adolescents and the 
efficiency of the strategies employed.  
</p>
<p>It is therefore recommended that children&#8216;s participation be institutionalized through 
</p>
<p>appropriate and representative fora and mechanisms, in accordance with General Comment 
No. 12 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the recommendations of the 20th 
Pan-American Conference. These should take into consideration the ongoing creation of 
Children's Consultative Councils and existing children's organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up of the recommendations of the Study by national independent human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>The development of national independent human rights institutions (NIHRIs) is 
recommended. Their actions should include follow-up to the recommendations of the 
Study. Among possible initiatives are: promotion of public policies; research and initiatives 
involving supervision and monitoring; provision of counselling/guidance; and in some 
cases response to specific complaints. It is also recommended that annual reports to 
Parliament discuss progress towards achievement of the Study&#180;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>Children and adolescents must have direct and user-friendly access to the NIHRI and have 
appropriate information on its mandate. 
</p>
<p>It is recommended that the NIHRIs institutionalize their collaboration with the SRSG so 
they can provide relevant information regarding follow-up of the Study. Similarly, it is 
important to have spaces for exchange and collaboration between the various NIHRIs at 
regional level so they can share knowledge and experiences and build synergies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Consideration of the recommendations by multilateral regional bodies and spaces for 
</b></p>
<p><b>interstate cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>Some forms of violence are transnational in nature, requiring interstate agreements for 
cooperation or multilateral action. Tackling such issues through multilateral bodies is 
essential. It is important to recognize that Ni&#241;@Sur, for example, has integrated into its 
working strategy the follow-up of the recommendations of the Study on Violence against 
Children.  
</p>
<p><b>  Promotion of alliances of actors and sectors to achieve greater impact 
</b></p>
<p>Initiatives like the one promoted by the GMC-CLAC are important in supporting progress 
towards compliance with the recommendations of the Study. They must be encouraged and 
maintained, ensuring their development at national and regional levels.   
</p>
<p>Within this framework it is important to stimulate and reinforce the local and national 
organizations that are working on these issues, whether individually or as part of networks 
and coalitions. It is also important to encourage and ensure exchange and cooperation 
among actors at national and regional levels, to ensure the visibility, dissemination and 
sharing of their various initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b>  Consideration of the recommendations by multilateral development organizations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international financial institutions 
</b></p>
<p>Given the unanimous support for the Study by the States and existing relationships for 
development cooperation among several of them, it is recommended that the Study and its 
recommendations be taken into account as a reference in strategic interventions in bilateral </p>


<p>cooperation between States, as well as in multilateral development organizations and 
international financial institutions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Consolidation of national systems to collect, analyse and disseminate data and 
</b></p>
<p><b>research on violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>Efforts are needed to strengthen national systems for generating and handling consolidated, 
uniform data that allows for comparison over time and comparison with data from other 
sources, including other countries. This system will be a key tool for planning public 
policies and for monitoring and evaluation. 
</p>
<p>Agreed conceptual frameworks must be reviewed to ensure they comply with the content 
and definitions of international standards on human rights. This review should result in 
more conceptual unity, which will allow for comparison of information, particularly 
between countries, and for better follow-up to ascertain the level of compliance with 
international human rights instruments. Unity of conceptual frameworks will also help to 
maximize cooperation between countries. 
</p>
<p>The information collection systems should contain both quantitative and qualitative data, 
have access to diverse sources and conduct research. Collaboration of national statistics 
centres with universities and research centres is important, as well as with civil society 
organizations that generate research and data on violence towards children. Adequate 
training for staff involved in information collection must also be addressed.  
</p>
<p>It is recommended that questions addressing issues of violence be included in household 
surveys, keeping in mind the limitations of such surveys when violence occurs within the 
family itself. It is recommended that the opinions and perspectives of children and 
adolescents be included and their experiences recorded. In this respect, it is felt that 
children and adolescents should participate directly in surveys and perception studies and 
other qualitative and quantitative research. Schools may be a setting for administration of 
such surveys, and it is recommended that experts conduct them.   
</p>
<p>Statistical information must be made public, respecting the principle of transparency and 
scrutiny of public administrations by their citizens while preserving individuals&#8216; right to 
</p>
<p>privacy. Accessibility and analysis of information by children and adolescents themselves 
should be considered. 
</p>
<p>Greater attention is recommended with regard to information collection regarding violence 
prevention, particularly on risk factors and protection. The same applies to information on 
forms of response to violence and recovery of victims. The information gathered should not 
be restricted to quantitative data on the number of violations and the types of violence.   
</p>
<p>Telephone helplines can be seen as an opportunity, as they can serve as an instrument to 
monitor and compile data on the facts reported and the process followed in response to 
specific cases (such as the number of cases reported that lead to a formal complaint, and the 
result, if any).  
</p>
<p>There must also be an increase in the number of monitoring tools, instruments and 
indicators available. Indicators developed must be grounded in international human rights 
instruments and incorporate enhanced equivalence and standardization factors, permitting 
comparison of data between countries and improved monitoring. Children of all ages and 
ethnicity and in all environments should be taken into account, particularly those incurring 
the greatest risk. Less visible forms of violence must be identified. 
</p>
<p>It is essential to integrate information databases across all sectors (e.g. education, health, 
etc.) since it is possible that data from different sectors are not being cross-referenced or 
jointly analysed. Effective data management is crucial. States should have integrated 
systems that draw on data generated by prevention, detection and protection services.  </p>


<p>National plans on violence must include indicators for measuring the scope of the 
objectives proposed, with particular attention to implementation at local level. Financial 
and public investment indicators should be considered. 
</p>
<p>It is recommended that the Inter-American Children&#8216;s Institute (IIN), as a regional technical 
body, support the work of unifying concepts and recognizing or standardizing indicators, 
providing a technical service to the States of the region. Another aspect of possible 
collaboration between the IIN and the States is development of an effective model of inter-
sectoral data management and modernization of instruments and systems. It is 
recommended that the IIN encourage initiatives in this respect, fostering exchange and 
taking into consideration good practices at country level (e.g. Ecuador and Mexico). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Follow-up to the Roadmap 
</b></p>
<p>Complements to this regional Roadmap are the Manifesto produced by children and 
adolescents of the Latin American countries participating in the meeting and the 
Declaration of the Meeting, to which the Government of Paraguay subscribed through its 
National Secretariat of Children and Adolescents.  
</p>
<p>Participants in the working groups also produced an initial draft roadmap for each country, 
adapting the recommendations to each country&#8216;s context. These roadmaps will later be 
</p>
<p>augmented and applied at national level by those who participated in this process in 
Asunci&#243;n. It is hoped that the resulting documents will be attached to the regional 
Roadmap, contributing the country level perspective.  
</p>
<p>In South America, the multilateral organization MERCOSUR and its Permanent 
Commission Ni&#241;@Sur, in conjunction with MERCOSUR children&#8216;s authorities, represents 
a valuable structure for institutionalizing regional follow-up to the Study, grounded in the 
Roadmap agreed to at the Asunci&#243;n meeting. Within this forum mechanisms can be 
established for exchange of experiences that contribute to implementation of the Study&#8216;s 
recommendations. In this respect, it should be considered that, every year at the Permanent 
Commission of Ni&#241;@Sur, each State presents a follow-up report about country level 
progress and unresolved challenges. Such a common approach has great value in creating 
opportunities for collective progress and synergies in the region. Technical support should 
be provided by MERCOSUR&#8216;s Institute of Human Rights and Public Policies. It is 
</p>
<p>recommended that Ni&#241;@Sur reinforce its institutional relationships with the SRSG with a 
view to contributing to this UN mandate. 
</p>
<p>Finally, MERCOSUR&#8216;s Member States and associates should consider providing support to 
</p>
<p>the SRSG&#8216;s Office. The Office depends on voluntary contributions, putting at risk the 
</p>
<p>efficiency, long-term planning and independence of the mandate. It is crucial that States &#8211; 
which unanimously declared their commitment to the Study and its recommendations at the 
UN General Assembly &#8211; mobilize in support of the SRSG&#8216;s mandate and contribute to 
ensuring the continuity and visibility of the agenda on violence against children within the 
United Nations system.  
</p>
<p><b>  Manifesto of children and adolescents from Latin American countries taking part in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the South American Meeting for Follow-Up to the United Nations Study on Violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Children and Adolescents. 
</b></p>
<p>Here in the city of Asunci&#243;n we have been taking part as delegations of organizations of 
children and adolescents from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, El 
Salvador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela, sharing reflections and concerns about 
violence against children and adolescents, and we therefore,  </p>


<p>Declare that: 
</p>
<p>1. Although we live in the same region, there is great inequality of opportunity and 
different forms of violence against children and adolescents in every country. Every State 
has different levels and forms in terms of compliance with the laws and rights of children 
and adolescents. 
</p>
<p>2. In some countries violence is permitted as a form of discipline, while in others any 
form of violence is punishable by law. 
</p>
<p>3. Structural violence is the effect of an unjust global capitalist system that is 
responsible for the impoverishment of most of the peoples of our countries. For us, 
structural violence means the contamination of the environment and of people by major 
agro-business proprietors. This contamination affects the health and lives of children and 
adolescents and their families (peasants and indigenous people) who are forced to leave 
their communities and migrate to the cities. 
</p>
<p>There is little likelihood of this form of expression of violence being denounced, since 
instead of helping, the protocols in place obstruct such procedures; and in themselves they 
display many social differences. 
</p>
<p>This situation creates exclusion and inequality in access to basic rights; poverty; and greater 
likelihood of exploitation of children, adolescents and their families. 
</p>
<p>4. For many years the culture, customs, territories and ways of life of the indigenous 
peoples of the continent have been subjugated, and we believe that this is a form of cultural, 
physical and symbolic violence against the children and adolescents of the indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>5. In most cases the laws and actions of States facilitate the violation of our rights in 
general. For example, in some countries they are trying to lower the age of criminal 
responsibility, while in others, the police and institutions are agents of re-victimization of 
child and adolescent victims of ill-treatment, exploitation, sexual abuse and other crimes.  
</p>
<p>6. There are many laws in the region, but they are not being complied with, and there 
are few institutions responsible for enforcing their compliance. 
</p>
<p>7. We also know that institutional bureaucracy is an obstacle to the immediate and 
quality attention to situations of violence against children and adolescents. 
</p>
<p>8. In most countries there are no specialized institutions like ministries of childhood 
and adolescence. 
</p>
<p>9. There are difficulties in the birth registration and documentation of people due to 
inefficiency and lack of access to the centres of registration in communities into which 
children and adolescents are born. 
</p>
<p>10. The centralization of services for children and adolescents hinders compliance with 
our rights. 
</p>
<p>11. The lack of dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is a form of 
violence present in all Latin American countries. Even so, children and adolescents have 
come together to make known, evaluate, propose and put into practice their rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The mass media of our countries overwhelmingly promote a negative image of 
children and adolescents, distorting information, publishing only what sells, and failing to 
educate. The mass media create negative stereotypes that re-victimize us, making us 
vulnerable to situations of violence. </p>


<p>We recommend that: 
</p>
<p>1. A regional body be created whose mandate is to review our different realities 
(including our differences) and that through this, children and adolescents can make their 
complaints to guarantee their rights. This regional body must centralize annual reports by 
each country on the situation of children and adolescents in relation to violence. 
</p>
<p>2. The countries approve laws that prohibit violence against children and adolescents, 
including violence with &#8215;disciplinary&#8216; objectives. 
</p>
<p>3. Public employees in institutions charged with the compliance or vigilance of some 
of the rights of children and adolescents are properly trained. 
</p>
<p>4. The laws are respected and that ministries of childhood and adolescence are created 
in the countries of the region, and that services of care and protection for children and 
adolescents are decentralized. 
</p>
<p>5. Other types of violence, including structural and symbolic violence, are investigated, 
to create public policies that can reverse this situation. We particularly recommend that the 
Commission take into account this type of violence, which for years has been an unknown 
factor in many States, in order to prevent and educate children and adolescents, young 
people and adults in a culture of respect and peace.  
</p>
<p>6. The Commission demand that States promote the rights of children and adolescents 
and monitor their application in families, institutions and society in general. 
</p>
<p>We demand that: 
</p>
<p>1. The States legally guarantee the rights of children and adolescents. That the different 
types of culture are not discriminated against or looked down upon, but that a way for 
plural participation is sought. 
</p>
<p>2. The States commit to effectively comply with our rights, to comply with the laws 
and to sanction anyone who fails to respect them. 
</p>
<p>3.  The media be educational agents reflecting the positive values and forms of 
expression of children and adolescents. 
</p>
<p>4. Culture, customs, traditions and dances and the restitution of the territories seized 
from the Indigenous Peoples of America are respected, to guarantee development and 
decent living conditions for children and adolescents of this sector. 
</p>
<p>5. That families expelled by agro-business from their communities of origin are 
protected. </p>

</p>
<p>Pursuant to the fruitful and constructive discussions that took place during the Conference 
with the purpose of assessing progress achieved in the implementation of the Second Arab 
Childhood Plan; 
</p>
<p><b>We declare our determination: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; To promote Arab partnership and strengthen joint Arab action mechanisms through 
exchanging expertise , developing capabilities and mobilizing resources to promote </p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; To pursue diligent efforts to promote the rights of the child, improve his/her status 
within the context of a rights-based approach that ensures the best interests of the 
child, based on the interdependent, holistic and indivisible character of rights and by 
applying the principle of non-discrimination to give the causes of childhood the 
priority they deserve; to mobilize financial and human resources required to 
implement sectoral plans and programmes through child-friendly budgets while 
establishing monitoring and evaluation systems; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To reaffirm our resolve to continue working to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals, the Goals of &#8213; World Fit for Children&#8214;, and the goals of the

challenges through, inter alia, submitting childhood-related issues to the Council of 
the League of Arab States at the Summit Level; finding ways to promote the role of 
Arab  funds and financial institutions in childhood projects, as a high priority  of 
development action based on regional cooperation and human development 
concepts, promoting human rights and economic integration between Arab countries 
as a driving force of genuine development; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To pursue work to update the Second Arab Childhood Plan to include well-defined

based on partnership between countries and different societal sectors, those working 
with children, with children themselves and their families, civil society, the private 
sector, academic centres and media, and to be implemented through the application 
of quality standards, efficiency and transparency.  In this context we emphasize the 
importance of incorporating a gender-sensitive approach in all child-related 
programmes and encouraging work to combat violence against women in view of its 
close link to the best interests of children. We also stress the importance of up-dating 
and developing the database on indicators on the situation of children in Arab 
countries as a reference for planning, policy formulation and programme design, 
while emphasizing the importance of conducting periodic studies on the situation of 
children in the Arab region in cooperation with relevant regional and international 
organizations.

<p><b>  Cairo Declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and Islamic Jurisprudence, November 2009 
</b></p>
<p>Under the patronage and in the presence of Her Excellency the First Lady of Egypt, Mrs. 
Suzanne Mubarak, the Cairo Conference was held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which coincides with the 20th anniversary 
of Egypt&#8216;s National Council on Childhood and Motherhood, the national body mandated to 
coordinate and monitor the realization of the rights of the child in Egypt. 
</p>
<p>The Conference was organized by the Ministry of State for Family and Population of Egypt 
and co-sponsored by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and UNICEF, with 
the valuable contribution of a wide range of partners who contributed to the success of the 
Conference. 
</p>
<p>The representatives from most OIC Member States, as well as international organizations, 
national human rights institutions, NGOs and children from ten OIC countries participated 
in the Conference. Participants expressed their deep appreciation to the Ministry of State 
for Family and Population of Egypt for its excellent organization of the Conference. 
</p>
<p>All participants highly appreciated the presence of Mrs. Mubarak for her visionary and 
exemplary leadership in the promotion of the rights of the child and the consideration of 
children as a priority in the political agenda. Participants appreciated as well the child rights 
based approach adopted by the NCCM and the progress achieved in the realization of the 
rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>The Conference recognized that the 20th anniversary of the CRC provides an opportunity to 
acknowledge progress building upon two decades of experience, and to renew the 
commitment of OIC Member States to continue to strengthen action towards the effective 
implementation of the CRC and to address prevailing challenges related to the realization of 
the rights of the child, with special emphasis on the contribution of principles of Islamic 
Shariah in fostering the purposes and objectives of this Convention. 
</p>
<p>The present Declaration reflects the deliberations during the Conference and identifies 
recommendations for action to enhance the full implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>Member States and civil society organizations from OIC countries (hereinafter participants) 
gathered in Cairo to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, to renew their commitment to the rights of the child for all 
children without discrimination, including on the basis of gender, to be guided by the best 
interests of the child, to ensure children&#8216;s survival and development and to involve children 
</p>
<p>meaningfully in decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p><b>Review of reservations 
</b></p>
<p>Participants acknowledged that some OIC Member States formulated reservations upon 
ratification as a precautionary measure. They also noted that the national experience in the 
realization of the rights of the child by OIC member-states has enriched the process of 
implementation of the Convention and helped to advance it further.  
</p>
<p>Participants stressed that the experience gained over the two decades of implementation of 
the Convention has shown the compatibility and convergence of the Convention with the 
principles of Islamic Shariah and the opportunity to review reservations and consider their 
withdrawal.  
</p>
<p>Participants welcome the increasing trend to review and withdraw reservations to the CRC 
which reflects the dynamic nature of Islamic Shariah, and the enriching exchange of </p>


<p>national experiences amongst member states, particularly those who have withdrawn or are 
in the process of withdrawing the reservations. 
</p>
<p>Participants welcome in particular the unanimous view expressed during the Conference 
that reservations, including those of a general nature, create an inaccurate perception of 
incompatibility between the CRC and Shariah law should be revisited with a view to 
withdraw them. 
</p>
<p><b>OIC Permanent Independent Expert Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>Participants welcome the decision to establish a permanent independent expert human 
rights commission as a principal organ of the OIC and call upon all OIC Member States to 
expedite this process which will enhance the promotion of children&#8216;s rights among all 
</p>
<p>human rights and foster the positive contribution of Islamic law and tradition in the process 
of implementation of the CRC. 
</p>
<p><b>The Optional Protocols to the CRC 
</b></p>
<p>Participants encourage OIC Member States that have ratified the Optional Protocol on the 
Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography; and the Optional Protocol on 
the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflicts to continue to strengthen their 
implementation in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child. 
</p>
<p>Participants urge all other OIC Member States to ratify the optional protocols without 
delay. These two protocols are: 
</p>
<p> 1. Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p> 2 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Proposal for a third Optional Protocol 
</b></p>
<p>Participants welcome the expressions of support from numerous OIC Member States to 
strengthen the mandate of the Open-Ended Working Group of the Human Rights Council to 
proceed with the drafting of a new Optional Protocol to the CRC to provide a 
communications procedure; encourages States and civil society to be actively involved. 
This should build upon positive experiences within OIC Member States in providing 
children with effective representation and remedies at the national level. 
</p>
<p><b>Enhanced Compliance with the Convention 
</b></p>
<p>Participants recommend that the OIC Member States make the implementation of the rights 
of children a matter of high priority on their political agenda and, building upon OIC 
positive national experiences, establish a national body with a clear and strong mandate and 
with the necessary financial and human resources to ensure the coordination of the 
implementation of the CRC and the regular evaluation of progress. Participants recommend 
that the OIC Member States develop and implement laws and programs on children&#8216;s rights 
</p>
<p>in close consultation with parliamentarians, traditional, religious and other national or local 
leaders. 
</p>
<p>Participants recommend that OIC Member States encourage a cooperative and productive 
partnership with civil society, in particular NGOs, and support their active involvement in 
developing, implementing and assessing the impact of child related legislation, policies and 
programs. </p>


<p><b>- Adequate resources for children 
</b></p>
<p>Participants urge OIC Member States to provide necessary human and financial resources 
for the implementation of the CRC, including the enforcement of laws and policies.  
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is recommended that OIC Member States make expenditure on the rights of 
the child visible in their annual national budget. 
</p>
<p><b>- Data Collection, analysis and dissemination 
</b></p>
<p>Participants urge OIC Member States to establish effective tools for systematic collection, 
analysis and dissemination of data on the implementation of the CRC, disaggregated by 
age, gender, urban\rural and other relevant factors; and to use this data for the development, 
implementation and regular review of their laws, policies and programs and to identify 
child vulnerabilities, to prevent discrimination and overcome disparities. 
</p>
<p><b>- Child social inclusion and eradication of poverty 
</b></p>
<p>Participants expressed deep concern at poverty and its negative impact on the realization of 
the rights of the child and urge OIC Member States to target the elimination of child 
poverty and to ensure children&#8216;s universal access to basic social services of quality and to 
</p>
<p>invest in children as a high priority in their poverty reduction strategies, particularly in the 
context of the current economic and financial crisis, and in order to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals for poverty reduction by 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>- International Cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>Participants recommend to States that are in a position to do so, to provide technical and 
financial assistance to other States in their implementation of the CRC, in the framework of 
bi-lateral or multi &#8211; lateral agreements, while taking into account country specific 
concluding observations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Participants 
call upon Member States of the UN to provide additional financial and human resources to 
allow the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty bodies to fulfill their 
mandates and call on the OIC, both Secretariat and Member States, to enhance their 
cooperation with OHCHR in this respect. 
</p>
<p><b>  Specific Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Child participation  
</b></p>
<p>40 children from 10 countries held a meeting for children on 21 &#8211; 22 November and 
participated equally in every session of the conference on 23 &#8211; 24 November.  
</p>
<p>Participants underscore the importance of promoting and supporting the participation of 
children in decision-making. They express their special appreciation for the contributions 
made by children during the Conference and for the recommendations they have put 
forward, which were prepared during their two day preparatory meeting.  
</p>
<p>Participants strongly recommend to all OIC Member States to provide children with 
meaningful opportunities to express their views and to take part in the process of 
developing and implementing laws, policies and programmes that affect children&#8216;s lives; 
</p>
<p>OIC Member States who have not yet done so, should also consider the establishment of 
Children&#8216;s Parliaments and ensure appropriate follow-up to their recommendations.  
</p>
<p>Participants also recommend that OIC Member States promote and support active<b> 
</b>participation in the family, in schools and in institutions for children, taking into account<b> 
</b>the Committee on the Rights of the Child&#8216;s General Comment on article 12 of the CRC,<b> </b>and 
the recommendation of their discussions.<b> </b></p>


<p><b>Child protection from discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>Participants renew their commitment to ensure the realization of the rights of all children 
without discrimination of any kind.  
</p>
<p>Participants commit to giving special attention to the realization of the rights of girls, 
including to achieve their right to education and to eliminate child marriage and other 
harmful traditional practices.  
</p>
<p>Participants urge OIC Member States to take legislative, administrative and social measures 
to support without discrimination the rights of children born out of wedlock. These 
measures should include facilities for ensuring that both parents support the child and the 
mother benefits from relevant financial support to ensure the upbringing of the child. 
Children&#8216;s inheritance rights should also be safeguarded. Measures should also be taken to 
</p>
<p>establish the legal responsibility of the father to contribute financially in the upbringing of 
the child and to allow the mother to take the necessary legal actions to establish through 
courts the fatherhood of the biological child.  
</p>
<p>Participants recognized that children with disabilities have a right to special attention and 
empowerment. The entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities provides an opportunity for renewed commitment to the realization of the rights 
of children with disabilities and for joint action between the two treaty bodies established 
by these treaties. 
</p>
<p>Participants also recognized the particular vulnerability of children deprived of parental 
care, belonging to minorities, living and working on the streets and children victims of 
economic exploitation and reiterated their commitment to enhance their protection. 
</p>
<p><b>Child protection from all forms of violence  
</b></p>
<p>Participants valued the presence and contribution of the newly appointed Special<b> 
</b>Representative of the SG on Violence against Children, Dr. Marta Santos Pais, and<b> 
</b>expressed their commitment to develop productive cooperation with the Special<b> 
</b>Representative and to provide her with necessary technical and financial support.<b> </b>In light of 
the child&#8216;s equal right to respect his or her human dignity and physical<b> </b>integrity, 
participants to the Conference recommend to the OIC member States to take all<b> </b>appropriate 
legislative, social and other measures for an effective follow-up to the<b> </b>recommendations 
made in the UN Study on Violence Against Children.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Participants call upon the OIC Member States to urgently review and reform their 
legislation to ensure the prohibition of all forms of violence against children and to link law 
reform with promotion of positive, non-violent forms of discipline. Building upon the 
promising experiences of OIC Member States, particular attention should be given to the 
prevention and combat against harmful practices, including FGM, child marriage, crimes 
committed in the name of honour, the use of children as camel jockeys, child trafficking, 
child domestic service and other forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p>Building upon positive national experiences from OIC Member States, participants to the 
Conference recommend that each State establish a high level focal point to coordinate all 
actions to prevent and combat all forms of violence against children, and promote the 
development of a well-resourced national strategy on violence against children, engaging 
with civil society, including children and young people. 
</p>
<p><b>Participants requested: 
</b></p>
<p> 1. That efforts should be exerted to provide protection for children under 
occupation, and in times of war. They demanded that those who violate the CRC by killing 
children or subjecting them to imprisonment, corporal and/or psychological torture, should 
be made accountable and brought to court. </p>


<p> 2. That poverty alleviation should be targeted, as poverty is considered a 
primary cause for children's main problems, which lead to their deprivation of enjoying a 
normal life. Participants encourage the OIC and its Member States to facilitate the 
establishment of a children&#8216;s forum to promote the contribution of children to the process 
of follow-up to the UN Study on Violence against Children and to keep children informed 
about developments in this area. 
</p>
<p><b>- Child marriage 
</b></p>
<p>Participants call upon all OIC Member States to raise the age of marriage to 18, ensuring 
full consent and registration of marriage. 
</p>
<p><b>- FGM  
</b></p>
<p>Participants to the Conference recommend the OIC member States to prohibit by law all 
forms of FGM and undertake awareness raising and informative campaigns, and promote 
social mobilisation in close consultation and cooperation with the traditional and religious 
leadership, NGOs, as well as with parliamentarians, to support the enforcement of the 
prohibition and the promotion of abandonment of this practice, and to provide people who 
are involved in this practice with alternative employment. 
</p>
<p><b>- Corporal Punishment  
</b></p>
<p>Participants to the Conference recommend that OIC Member States prohibit all corporal 
punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of punishment or treatment of children, in 
all settings including within schools and within the family, linking law reform with the 
promotion of positive, non-violent forms of discipline. 
</p>
<p><b>- Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>Participants call on OIC Member States to complete the development of an effective and 
efficient juvenile justice system which ensures the full implementation of the CRC in 
particular articles 37 and 40, and other relevant international standards and taking into 
account the Committee on the Rights of the Child&#8216;s General Comment No. 10. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, special attention should be paid to the establishment and progressive raising of the 
minimum age for criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>Participants call on OIC Member States to take necessary measures to respond to children 
in conflict with the law without resorting to judicial proceedings providing that human 
rights and legal safeguards are fully respected, including community service, restorative 
justice, (taking into account the Lima 2009 - Declaration on Restorative Juvenile Justice). 
</p>
<p>Participants call on OIC Member States to take measures to ensure that all children in 
conflict with the law are provided with free legal or other appropriate assistance and that 
deprivation of liberty, including pre-trial detention, is only used as a measure of last resort 
and for the shortest possible period of time, by fully implementing recommendations of the 
CRC Committee made in Gen. Comment No. 10 regarding the use of pre-trial detention and 
by introducing and effectively using suspended sentencing and early release. 
</p>
<p>Participants call on OIC Member States to take legislative measures to abolish the 
imposition of capital punishment on persons who committed a crime when under the age of 
18, and suspend the execution of any pending capital punishment. Furthermore, it is 
recommended to abolish all forms of life imprisonment for crimes committed before the 
age of 18. 
</p>
<p>Participants call on OIC Member States to take legislative measures to ensure that children 
deprived of their liberty have access to education, adequate health care and to sports and 
other leisure opportunities, can maintain regular contact with their parents and other family </p>


<p>members and are fully protected against all forms of violence, including inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>Participants call on OIC Member States to safeguard the rights of child victims and 
witnesses involved with judicial proceedings and take into consideration relevant UN 
standards and guidelines.  
</p>
<p>The participants express their profound thanks and appreciation to the Arab Republic of 
Egypt, represented by the Ministry of State for Family and Population, for the kind 
hospitality extended to them. Due recognition is also extended to the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference and UNICEF, and all entities that supported the successful outcome of 
this conference. </p>


<p><b>  South Asia Initiative to End Violence against Children 
(SAIEVAC) 2010-2015 Workplan, Kathmandu, Nepal, 
November 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Background  
</b></p>
<p>The governments of South Asia have followed up the recommendations to the UN Study on 
Violence Against Children (2006) to varying degrees. Current initiatives to protect children 
from violence are fragmented, largely uncoordinated and ad hoc. Adopting a child 
protection systems approach means children are treated as individuals and receive a 
comprehensive range of services for larger overall impact. It comprises the set of strategies, 
policies, plans, laws, regulations and services needed across all social sectors &#8212; especially 
social welfare, education, health, security and justice &#8212; to support prevention and response 
to protection related risks. Responsibilities need to be spread across government agencies, 
with services delivered by national and local authorities, non-State providers, and 
community groups, making coordination between sectors and levels, including routine 
referral systems, a necessary component of effective child protection systems. 
Strengthening such systems requires attention to policy reform, institutional capacity 
development, planning, budgeting, monitoring and information systems. Child protection 
systems are most effective when structured around community-based protection and require 
an aware and supportive public. Through the formation of the South Asia Initiative to End 
Violence Against Children (SAIEVAC) governments have reiterated their commitment to 
addressing the enormous scale and urgency of violence against children in all forms and 
this workplan is a strategic framework to coordinate, standardize, and monitor progress 
annually. While the UN Study&#8216;s recommendations are an overall <i>broad </i>framework for all 
governments in South Asia, this workplan provides <i>specific </i>actions for governments in the 
region and offers practical indicators to ensure governments can measure change.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Vision, Aims, Scope, Definitions  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2.1 Vision  
</b></p>
<p>SAIEVAC&#8216;s vision is that all children, girls and boys, throughout South Asia enjoy their 
right to an environment free from all forms of violence, abuse, exploitation, neglect and 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.2 Aims  
</b></p>
<p>The aims of the workplan are:  
</p>
<p> a. To ensure the realization of children&#8216;s rights as stated in the UNCRC and its 
Optional Protocols  
</p>
<p> b. To prevent and respond to all forms of neglect, abuse, exploitation and 
violence against children in all settings  
</p>
<p> c. To promote the adoption, implementation, and monitoring of integrated 
national strategies with adequate budgets and resource allocation to prevent and protect 
children from violence and ensure response  
</p>
<p> d. To reinforce regional cooperation to end violence against children in South 
Asia  </p>


<p><b> 2.3 Scope and Definitions  
</b></p>
<p>A child shall mean any person under the age of 18 years and will include adolescents in its 
mandate. In line with Article 19 of the UNCRC, &#8220;violence&#8221; is defined as including all 
forms of physical or mental violence, injury and abuse, neglect and negligent treatment, 
maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse. This definition covers exposure of 
children to violence in the home, communities, schools, institutions, workplaces, and in 
development and emergency settings. Violence is understood to occur not only between 
adults and children but also between children. Violence shall be used as a general term 
encompassing all forms of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation Gender aspects of 
violence will be addressed as part of the integrated approach and due account will be taken 
of the different risks boys and girls face in respect of violence and of the different 
consequences of violence for girls and boys. All children within the jurisdiction of States 
regardless of their sex, race, colour, language, religion, caste, class, disability or other 
status, national or social origin, political or other opinion should be protected from all 
forms of violence and discrimination.

<p><b> 4. Issue Based Action  
</b></p>
<p>The issues of early marriage, sexual abuse and exploitation, trafficking, corporal 
punishment, and child labour are seen as extremely critical issues that are affecting children 
throughout the region. Gender and discrimination are cross-cutting issues throughout all 
areas. Additionally, lack of birth registration is an important and is a preventive measure for 
many forms of violence. Birth registration provides an official record of a child&#8216;s existence, 
nationality and age and is considered a fundamental human right under Article 7 of the 
UNCRC and should therefore be made mandatory and free of cost in all countries in South 
Asia. For more information about the severity of these issues in the region please see 
ANNEX 1. All South Asian Governments commit to implement the following 
recommendations and report back to SAIEVAC using the indicators provided. All 
recommendations are in line with the &#8215;SAARC Convention on Regional Arrangements for 
the promotion of child welfare in South Asia&#8216; and the UNCRC.

<p><b>  Key Advocacy Messages 
</b></p>
<p>1.<b> Implement credible national plans. </b>Governments of South Asia need to implement 
national plans for ending violence against children. Some of these plans exist on paper but 
are not properly implemented; in other cases plans will need to be developed or 
strengthened. National plans should focus on creating and integrated and holistic approach 
by developing child protection systems that respond to violence from the prevention stages 
through to rehabilitation and reintegration of children. Donors, international agencies, and 
local and national NGOs should assist in the development of plans and implementation.  
</p>
<p>2.<b> Legally ban all forms of violence in all settings. </b>The legal prohibition of violence 
is important as it conveys a clear message of political commitment to prevention work and 
the use of non-violent alternatives for conflict resolution. It constitutes a vital safeguard for 
child victims and witnesses, being a strong reference for capacity-building initiatives and 
the development of guidance and codes of conduct for professionals working with and for 
children. Law reform gains renewed value when used in support of public information and 
awareness-raising activities, for promoting positive discipline, ending harmful practices, 
social mobilization and behavior change.  </p>


<p>3. <b>Mobilise additional resources. </b>Governments need to mobilize additional resources 
to address all issues of violence in a comprehensive manner so that services reach 
marginalized populations. Donors, international agencies, and local and national NGOs 
should support this process.  
</p>
<p>4. <b>Recognise violence goes beyond the physical. </b>Violence is multidimensional and 
includes both physical and psychological abuse, neglect and exploitation. It calls for a 
holistic approach to the treatment of the circumstance of the violent incident, towards the 
child and towards the perpetrator (s). The best interest of the child must be viewed in this 
context when designing societal reactions and responses.  
</p>
<p>5. <b>Understand that both boys and girls experience violence</b>. It is a common 
misconception in South Asia that only girls suffer from violence and that boys are able to 
protect themselves. In fact it has been shown that boys also experience violence and in 
some setting may be more vulnerable to violence. Governments need to ensure that 
legislation and programmes protect and prohibit violence against both boys and girls and 
address their particular needs in different settings.  
</p>
<p><b>  Key issues to be addressed in South Asia 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Early Marriage  
</b></p>
<p>Early marriage is rampant in South Asia with 46 per cent of young women reporting being 
married before the age of 18. Early marriage usually occurs because of poverty and the lack 
of economic opportunities for girls in rural areas. Girls are either seen as an economic 
burden or valued as capital for their exchange value in terms of goods, money or livestock. 
Early marriage may also be seen as a way of protecting young girls and ensuring their 
security. Research has shown that child brides are often more likely to experience domestic 
violence and sexual abuse and least likely to take action against this abuse. They attain 
lower schooling, lower social status in their husbands&#8216; families, have less reproductive 
</p>
<p>control, and suffer higher rates of maternal mortality. They are often forced out of school 
without an education and experience health problems as their bodies are too immature to 
give birth.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sexual abuse and exploitation  
</b></p>
<p>The most hidden and underreported form of violence against children and youth is sexual 
abuse. Sexual abuse affects both boys and girls and often happens within the family, in 
schools and the community, in the majority of cases (outside armed conflict zones) 
perpetrated by someone familiar to the child. Additionally, commercial sexual exploitation 
of children continues to be one of the most pervasive violations of children&#8216;s rights in South 
Asia and includes child abuse through child prostitution, sex tourism, child pornography, 
internet pornography and trafficking. Recent studies provide evidence of sexual 
exploitation of boys to a much larger extent than previously recognized. The victims of 
exploitation and abuse are also at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Sexual 
abuse and exploitation are seldom reported because of a lack of child protection services, a 
lack of awareness-raising of them as human rights violations and crimes and because of the 
stigma faced by victims of such abuse and exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>The criminal and clandestine nature of trafficking makes it difficult to gather reliable data 
but child trafficking is widespread in South Asia, and include both internal trafficking and 
trafficking across international borders. Victims of trafficking end up in various forms of 
abuse and human rights violations including sexual and economic exploitation, i.e. doing 
domestic work, working in factories, on the streets, or in other forms of hazardous labor </p>


<p>that come in the way of the children&#8216;s enjoyment of rights and fundamental freedoms. A 
</p>
<p>common feature of child trafficking is that young girls and boys are often trafficked from 
rural communities to urban areas. Traffickers are motivated by financial gain, and 
sometimes lure young girls into sex work on false pretenses. Children are vulnerable to 
being trafficked if they are poor or because of a high rate of unsafe migration, weak law 
enforcement, insufficient household income, ill-treatment and physical abuse at home and 
in the community, parental alcoholism, lack of food, and forced marriages. When children 
without birth registration and identity proof are trafficked tracing them becomes extremely 
difficult. In most of the countries in the region, birth registration is still difficult to obtain as 
seen by the fact that 36% of South Asia's children are unregistered at birth. 
</p>
<p>The governments of South Asia have committed themselves through ratification of the 
SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for 
Prostitution( 2002) to tackle the issue. As part of a coordinated regional response, the 
governments have also committed to implement a SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) for 
effectively implementing the SAARC Convention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Corporal Punishment 
</b></p>
<p>Violent punishment of children is now recognised as a human rights violation. The 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and other human rights Treaty Bodies systematically 
recommend prohibition of corporal punishment and other humiliating forms of punishment 
in all settings including the home/family. Explicit prohibition was also recommended by the 
UNSG&#8216;s Study on Violence against Children. South Asian States committed to prohibiting 
all corporal punishment following the Study&#8216;s 2005 regional consultation and the follow-up 
meeting in 2006. Corporal punishment is widely practised at home and in schools, other 
institutions and penal systems for young people, as well as in situations of child labour. It 
remains socially accepted throughout the region, as it does in all regions of the world, 
except in the few countries where it has been prohibited and systematically challenged 
through sustained public, teacher and parent education. Corporal punishment in the form of 
hitting, slapping, kicking, beating, pulling hair, etc., and other forms of humiliating 
punishment are not as yet generally perceived as abusive. There is inadequate teacher 
training and parent education, promoting positive, non-violent forms of discipline. The 
persisting legality and social approval of violent punishment is the most symbolic reflection 
of children&#8216;s low status in societies, as possessions rather than individual people and rights-
holders. Ending this legalised violence against children is not only a human rights 
imperative, it is also an essential strategy for reducing and eliminating all other forms of 
violence against children. No state can claim it has an effective child protection system 
while its laws still authorise and defend corporal punishment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Child Labour 
</b></p>
<p>In South Asia, around 44 million or 13% of all children are involved in child labour. 
Economic exploitation is seen as one of the most common forms of violence in the region. 
Children often work long hours with little or no pay. There is a great deal of commonality 
across the South Asian countries in the forms of child labour, most notably in the areas of 
children in hazardous child labour, child domestic labour, children in export oriented 
industries, child bonded labour particularly in agriculture, and child labour in the informal 
economy, particularly in urban areas. Children not only face occupational hazards like 
handling heavy machineries or chemicals in their workplaces, but are also vulnerable and 
subjected to physical and sexual abuse. Additionally, these children are usually denied 
educational opportunities, which leads to a cycle of poverty and vulnerability.  </p>


<p><b>  Beijing Declaration on South-South Cooperation for Child 
Rights in the Asia Pacific Region, November 2010 
</b></p>
<p>1. We, the delegations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, 
Cambodia, China, Democratic People&#8216;s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Timor-
Leste, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Lao People&#8216;s 
Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Republic of Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, 
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vanuatu 
and Viet Nam, assembling to build strong cooperation and effective networking at the High 
Level Meeting for South-South cooperation for Child Rights in the Asia Pacific Region in 
Beijing, China, on 4-6 November 2010:  
</p>
<p> Acknowledge with gratitude the excellent arrangements put in place for the 
consultations by the Government of the People&#8216;s Republic of China as hosts, and the 
</p>
<p>support of the United Nations Children&#8216;s Fund (UNICEF);  
</p>
<p> Note with satisfaction the positive engagement of the 28 participating governments 
at the High Level Meeting in exploring potential areas of future intra and inter-regional 
cooperation to advance, promote and protect the rights of child, within the framework of 
South-South cooperation; and  
</p>
<p> Welcome the active participation of a number of partner organizations in Beijing 
with great interest in strengthening cooperation for the promotion of child rights in the Asia 
Pacific Region, namely the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific (UN ESCAP).  
</p>
<p>2. We reaffirm our commitment to the realization of all rights of all children within our 
respective national jurisdictions, as expressed in our universal ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and wide ratification of its two Optional Protocols: 
(i) on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and (ii) on the Sale of Children, 
Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and other relevant human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>3. We remain firmly committed to accelerate our ongoing efforts to achieve progress 
against internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the 
Millennium Declaration, the Declaration and Plan of Action emerging from the United 
Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in 2002, and the World Fit for 
Children +5 Declaration agreed at the December 2007 Special Session on Children.  
</p>
<p><b>  Status of Children in Asia and the Pacific  
</b></p>
<p>4. We welcome the substantive progress that has been achieved by countries across the 
Asia Pacific Region in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and in 
advancing the situation of our children, in particular. We acknowledge, however, the 
challenges remaining for many countries over the next five years, as reflected in the 20-22 
September 2010 High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals at the 
sixty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We recognize that despite the 
development gains achieved in recent years, large numbers of children in Asia and the 
Pacific still do not have access to quality education and health care. We also recognize the 
urgent need to address issues of hunger, malnutrition, maternal and neo-natal mortality, 
child protection and income and social disparities, in particular.  </p>


<p><b>  Prospects for Greater South-South Cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>5. We acknowledge that, building on the series of earlier regional high-level 
consultations that began in 1991, the Beijing High-Level Meeting on Cooperation for Child 
Rights in the Asia Pacific Region provided a valuable opportunity for countries of the 
region to share good practices and lessons learned in support of the realization of child 
rights. We welcome the presentations by governments on their experiences in addressing 
each of the three main conference themes: (i) the development of a systems approach to 
child protection and child welfare in the Asia Pacific region, (ii) the achievement of the 
MDGs with equity &#8211; country experiences in the Asia Pacific region, and (iii) saving and 
enhancing children&#8216;s lives through enhanced disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the Asia 
</p>
<p>Pacific region. We note that these three conference themes represent issues of growing 
significance in the region, and areas where greater cooperation within a South-South 
framework would potentially deliver significant benefits for the countries adopting this 
declaration.  
</p>
<p>6. We endorse the outcomes of the 2009 High-Level United Nations Conference on 
South-South Cooperation in Nairobi, Kenya. We reaffirm that South-South cooperation 
should be advanced as &#8213;a partnership among equals, based on solidarity&#8214;, and be guided by 
</p>
<p>the principles of respect for national sovereignty and ownership, free of any conditionality. 
We note that the Nairobi Outcome Document emphasizes that South-South cooperation is 
not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North-South cooperation, and urges United 
Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies to take concrete steps to support 
South-South cooperation by facilitating this cooperation and strengthening the capabilities 
of regional organizations.  
</p>
<p>7. We are convinced that, despite the great diversity represented by the 28 Asia Pacific 
countries participating in the Beijing High-Level Meeting, the people of the region share 
much in common, have strong mutual interests in socio-economic and human development, 
and have much to gain from closer cooperation. The Asia Pacific region is home to people 
from a vast array of different cultures and civilizations, ethnicities and languages and 
includes countries, and regions within countries, with wide differences in per capita income 
and greatly varying populations. We reaffirm that child rights are fundamental to all 
cultures and societies, and that protection, respect, promotion and fulfillment of child rights 
are vital for economic growth and human development.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sharing Lessons Learned  
</b></p>
<p>8. We recognize that there are a number of examples where South-South cooperation 
in the Asia Pacific region contributed to important development gains. Cooperation through 
regional organizations such as the Association for South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Secretariat of the 
Pacific Community (SPC) have, for example, helped produce greater economic integration, 
a more stable security environment and a stronger political voice in global affairs for the 
countries of South-East Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific respectively. We note positively 
that a number of countries in the Asia Pacific region are already working together to 
advance children&#8216;s rights, due to their mutual interest in improving the situation of children, 
</p>
<p>and the potential value of exchanges with countries that have recent and relevant experience 
in addressing similar development challenges.  
</p>
<p>9. We acknowledge the growing number of complex cross-border issues affecting 
children, such as trafficking, drug abuse, the spread of infectious disease such as HIV and 
AIDS, and irregular migration, where effective solutions can only be achieved through 
broad and concerted action from multiple countries. We note with appreciation the </p>


<p>examples of best practice and lessons learned featured in country panel presentations and 
supporting papers on South-South cooperation for child rights.  
</p>
<p>10. We affirm that these consultations in Beijing, in addition to providing a platform for 
sharing best practices and lessons learned on child rights among countries of the Asia 
Pacific region, also represent a starting point in considering new opportunities for South-
South exchanges to advance child rights for mutual gains. Drawing on the examples 
highlighted during the High-Level Meeting, we commit to pursue new opportunities for 
South-South cooperation in the Asia Pacific region to advance child rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Child Protection and Child Welfare in the Asia Pacific Region  
</b></p>
<p>11. We note with concern that, despite the efforts of governments across the region to 
take concrete steps to ensure the protection of children, children in the Asia Pacific Region 
continue to face serious child protection challenges, including violence and abuse, child 
trafficking, corporal punishment, child pornography, neglect, early marriage, rigorous 
imprisonment, child labour and exploitation and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>12. We recognize that the challenges in developing a comprehensive child protection 
and child welfare system are significant, and note the growing body of evidence which 
highlights not only the impact of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect on the individual 
child&#8216;s development and capacities, but also the longer-term costs of such impacts to the 
socio-economic development of society as a whole.  
</p>
<p>13. We recognize the need to pursue an approach that is focused primarily on prevention 
in the first instance and which ensures sustainability, cost efficiency and effectiveness. We 
advocate that such a systematic approach to addressing child protection concerns should be 
based on laws and policies that focus on safeguarding children from potential harm, and 
banning all forms of violence against children, would form the foundation of a national 
child protection system. We also recognize the value of maintaining the positive aspects of 
safety nets for children offered by our traditions of communities and extended families.  
</p>
<p>14. We therefore commit to building and strengthening adequately-resourced national 
child protection and welfare systems and mechanisms which include the prevention of 
violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation, the establishment of timely and appropriate 
responses where protection concerns arise, and mitigation of the impact of such concerns 
on the lives of children and their families. We agree that building and strengthening a 
national child protection system is an area where there is considerable scope for countries 
to learn from each other, not only in developing the legislative and policy framework, but 
also in terms of implementation and enforcement.  
</p>
<p><b>  Achieving MDGs with Equity: Country Experiences in the Asia Pacific 
</b></p>
<p><b>Region  
</b></p>
<p>15. We acknowledge that, while countries across the Asia Pacific region have made 
significant economic progress over the past two decades, serious and greater efforts are 
required to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable children benefit from this progress. 
We note with concern that national progress on the MDGs is undermined by persisting and 
growing disparities. Policies and legislation to address these disparities across MDG 
indicators are urgently needed, and strategies such as geographic and pro-poor focus must 
be employed.  
</p>
<p>16. We note the findings of the September 2010 UNICEF global studies <i>Narrowing the 
Gaps to Meet the Goals </i>and <i>Progress for Children: Achieving the MDGs with Equity </i>that </p>


<p>the global community could potentially save millions of lives by investing first in the most 
disadvantaged and at risk children and groups and communities, and that such an equity-
focused approach would also help address the widening disparities that are accompanying 
progress towards the MDGs.  
</p>
<p>17. We note with appreciation the numerous examples cited by participating 
governments at the High-Level Meeting of how they have sought to address issues of 
inequity. We underline that these examples serve to highlight the important potential role of 
inter and intra-regional cooperation in channeling human and financial resources towards 
addressing disparities. We, the governments adopting this declaration, commit to do more 
to share relevant experiences and promote knowledge sharing in creating social safety nets 
for the poor.  
</p>
<p><b>  Children and Disaster Risk Reduction in the Asia Pacific Region  
</b></p>
<p>18. We acknowledge the rapidly changing climate and the importance of disaster risk 
reduction (DRR) as a frontline strategy of climate change adaptation, and recognize the 
vulnerability of children to disasters, and that such vulnerability is being exacerbated by 
climate change. We also acknowledge that risk mitigation and disaster prevention need to 
be given as much attention as emergency preparedness and disaster response. Effective 
DRR can safeguard economic growth, social cohesion and environmental sustainability, 
while saving lives and livelihoods now and for future generations.  
</p>
<p>19. We recognize that designing and implementing community-based interventions &#8211; 
with specific attention given to children &#8211; and by promoting child-centred disaster risk 
reduction &#8211; which should include the participation of children as key potential resources &#8211; 
will support the outcomes sought by the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>20. We commend the numerous initiatives for progressing community-based and child-
centred disaster risk reduction at the national and sub-national level. We urge the greater 
regional use, coordination and streamlining of such knowledge for the collective benefit of 
all Asia Pacific countries.  
</p>
<p><b>  Strengthening Cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>21. We note that the Beijing High-Level Meeting also provided an opportunity for 
participating governments and partner organizations to identify new and existing processes 
and mechanisms that could usefully support greater intra and inter-regional cooperation 
among countries of the Asia Pacific to advance child rights. We welcome, in particular, 
presentations during the plenary session on regional perspectives and partnerships by senior 
representatives from the SPC, ADB and UN ESCAP on existing mechanisms for 
cooperation in the region, and those which could be adapted or mirrored to provide a 
platform for greater cooperation on child rights.  
</p>
<p>22. We welcome the greater development of triangular exchanges involving countries of 
both the South and North to advance child rights, and call on UNICEF, other United 
Nations funds, programmes and agencies and other partner organizations to remain ready to 
assist this process.  
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>23. Building on the discussions during the High-Level Meeting on Cooperation for 
Child Rights in the Asia Pacific Region, we undertake to pursue the following goals and </p>


<p>strategies on how we can work together more closely to more fully realize the rights of all 
children in this region:  
</p>
<p><b> a) South-South Cooperation for Child Rights  
</b></p>
<p>i. Explore avenues to share, and otherwise make accessible to other countries in the Asia 
Pacific region, details of individual country experiences - both good practices and lessons 
learned - to advance children&#8216;s rights;  
</p>
<p>ii. Support the establishment of a central database for sharing knowledge on regional efforts 
to advance child rights, that will make country experiences more accessible;  
</p>
<p>iii. Support the development of a regional strategy for South-South cooperation 
programmes for child rights.  
</p>
<p><b> b) Child Protection and Child Welfare  
</b></p>
<p>i. Explore the possibility of establishing a regional forum on inter-country exchange on 
inter-sectoral delivery of child protection services across technical disciplines, such as 
among social welfare, law enforcement, justice, health and education;  
</p>
<p>ii. Develop a regional dialogue on approaches to child welfare and child protection services 
which focuses on prevention and encourages the mobilisation of local resources and 
cultural assets;  
</p>
<p>iii. Enhance inter-country exchange and the sharing of good practices in the development of 
a social work force and their critical role in multi-sectoral approaches to preventing and 
responding to child protection concerns within a systems-based approach;  
</p>
<p><b> c) Achieving the MDGs with Equity  
</b></p>
<p>i. Engage in collaboration on how to improve the collection and use of data and evidence 
that will increase understanding of disparities and their underlying causes;  
</p>
<p>ii. Formally assess, present and promote successful country experiences, and examine 
successful experiences elsewhere in reducing disparities to assess the feasibility of adapting 
and replicating them;  
</p>
<p>iii. Encourage regional-level research studies to examine and review in detail relevant data 
and literature in support of initiatives designed to reduce disparities;  
</p>
<p>iv. Explore the possibility of establishing a regional repository of knowledge, expertise and 
data on equity issues.  
</p>
<p><b> d) Children and Disaster Risk Reduction  
</b></p>
<p>i. Pursue concerted strategies, at national and regional levels, to encourage closer 
coordination among the range of governance, development and risk management 
institutions in Asia and the Pacific, with the aim of promoting more regular, systematic and 
results-oriented exchanges of knowledge, skills, resources, technology and information on 
disaster risk reduction, including child-centred DRR.  
</p>
<p>ii. Mainstream community-based and child-centred DRR into regional and sub-regional 
development approaches, including through greater South-South exchanges on child-
sensitive risk assessments, so that risk-informed programme planning is factored into 
project design, implementation and evaluation as much as possible.  
</p>
<p>iii. Increase exchanges among countries and sub-regions in Asia and the Pacific to ensure 
that practical measures for child-friendly disaster risk reduction are integrated into 
community-based DRR efforts - recognizing that risks first and foremost are local </p>


<p>phenomena in which communities have a central role in seeking to reduce vulnerabilities 
and enhance capacity.  
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up and Future Consultations  
</b></p>
<p>24. We welcome a number of potential mechanisms raised in plenary discussions in 
Beijing that could provide an effective vehicle to follow-up on our commitments to 
strengthen cooperation on child rights. We invite UNICEF to collaborate with regional 
organizations to assist governments in continued monitoring of their progress in meeting 
the agreed recommendations in this declaration.  
</p>
<p>25. We reaffirm that the High-Level Meeting in Beijing represented a beginning in more 
intensive efforts to strengthen and deepen South-South cooperation among countries of the 
Asia Pacific region to advance children&#8216;s rights. To that end, we agree to meet again at 
Ministerial level in India in 2013 to assess progress and advance these issues further<i>. </i> 
</p>
<p><b>  Adoption  
</b></p>
<p>26. We unanimously adopt this, the Beijing Declaration on South-South Cooperation for 
Child Rights in the Asia Pacific Region. We thank the Government of the People&#8216;s 
Republic of China, and the people of Beijing, for their warm hospitality as hosts of the 
meeting, and welcome UNICEF&#8216;s support for the consultations. </p>


<p><b>  African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of 
the Child,  Special Session on Violence against Children 
Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia, March 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Special Session on Violence against Children 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Statement </b>&#8220;violence against children: <b>Report on progress and 
</b>challenges&#8221; by Dr Marta Santos Pais, S<b>pecial Representative of the 
UN Secretary-General, on violence against children  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Report statement was presented by the Representative of UNICEF Liaison 
Office to the AUC on behalf of the UN SRSG who was unable to attend due to other 
commitments. 
</p>
<p>2. The UNSRSG mentioned that the Committee&#8216;s debate was a golden opportunity to 
lay down a strategic agenda for achieving progress in preventing and combating violence 
against children within the African region. 
</p>
<p>3. She further mentioned that the UNSRSG mandate was framed by the UN study on 
Violence against Children and its strategic recommendations.  
</p>
<p>4. The UNSRSG mentioned the following as their priority focus areas:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promoting a Strategic Agenda derived from twelve overarching recommendations of 
the UN Study on Violence 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development in each state of a national comprehensive strategy to prevent and 
respond to all forms of violence,  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consolidating Strategic Partnership with certain identified alliances in favour of the 
protection of children from all forms of violence.  
</p>
<p>5. Concerning cooperating with key partners, she mentioned the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation with intergovernmental and regional organisation and institutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation with UN and regional human rights treaty bodies and mechanisms as 
well as with civil society organisations 
</p>
<p>6. In conclusion, the UNSRSG suggested in the message strategic ways for promoting 
the Committee&#8216;s work, namely:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Development of a strategic agenda of collaboration with the ACERWC to help 
consolidate an African environment fit for children where violence has no place;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; ACERWC should provide monitoring that focuses on the protection of children 
from all forms of violence;  
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Collaboration in an advocacy campaign to call for explicit legal ban on all forms of 
violence against children, including corporal punishment; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Collaboration with key partners (UNICEF and ACPF) to promote the development 
of an African report on national follow-up to the recommendation of the UN Study 
on Violence against Children.  
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Presentation on  &#8213;violence against children in Africa: the <i>Challenges and priorities 
for Africa</i>&#8214; by the African Child Policy Forum </p>


<p>7. The presenter informed the meeting that violence remained a pervasive problem 
hidden from the public view and almost absent from the political agenda. He provided 
statistical evidence on ACPF studies of children in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia suggesting 
that almost all children under the age of 15 experienced some form of violence at home, at 
school, in institutions, on the street or at the workplace. The girl child particularly were 
vulnerable with a huge proportion reporting to have been victims of one form of violence or 
another including physical, emotional sexual and psychological abuse. 
</p>
<p>8. He went on to cite the recommendation reached for the attention of the AECRWC as 
well as the African Union. 
</p>
<p>(i) Make violence against children a particular area of concern in national 
reporting;  
</p>
<p>(ii) Establish a programme of cooperation with the UN Special; Representative 
on violence against children;  
</p>
<p>(iii) Embark on a major programme of advocacy and action;  
</p>
<p>(iv) Promote national policy and legal reforms;  
</p>
<p>(v) Put child well-being in general and violence against children, particular, on 
the political agenda. 
</p>
<p>9. After the two presentations the participants discussed and recommended that 
countries should be lobbied to become champions on combating violence against children 
and that it should be put on the Agenda of AU Head of State Summit.

<p><b>  Council of Europe Strategy for 2009-2011 adopted by the 
Committee of Ministers, November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>At their 3rd Summit, the heads of state and government of the Council of Europe renewed 
their commitment to children&#8216;s rights and asked the Council of Europe: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; to mainstream children&#8216;s rights in all Council of Europe policies and co-ordinate all 
Council of Europe activities related to children;a 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>to eradicate all forms of violence against children, in particular through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>launching of a three-year plan of action and specific measures against sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children. 
</b></p>
<p>The programme, &#8213;<b>Building a Europe for and with children</b>&#8214; is the Council of Europe's 
</p>
<p>response to this mandate. Launched in Monaco in April 2006, it has strengthened the work 
on the rights of the child and developed specific tools to prevent and fight against several 
forms of violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Programme &#8220;Building a Europe for and with children 2009<b>-2011: the 
</b>Stockholm strategy&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Programme aim: 
</b></p>
<p>The programme aim is: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; to support the implementation of international standards in the field of children&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>rights by all Council of Europe member states, emphasising authorities&#8216; 
responsibility and accountability at the national, regional and local levels. The 
programme aims in particular to promote the implementation of the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, highlighting its main principles: non-
discrimination, the right to life and development, the best interests of the child as a 
primary consideration for decision makers, and the right of children to be heard. It 
also aims to implement the European Convention on Human Rights and the 
European Social Charter and to promote other existing Council of Europe legal 
instruments in relation to childhood (participation, protection and rights), youth and 
family; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; to introduce a child rights perspective in all policies and activities of the Council of 
Europe and to support such an approach within the member states. The child rights 
perspective should be holistic and comprehensive, addressing the rights of the child 
to &#8213;provision, protection and participation&#8214;b and take into account equality and 
</p>
<p>  
 a In this context the same definition of child is used as in the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, that is every human being below the age of 18. 
 b The three Ps, a commonly used clustering of the rights in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p>according to Professor Eugeen Verhellen. These include &#8213;provision&#8214;: the rights of the child to access 
</p>
<p>to certain goods and services such as education, health care, an adequate standard of living and social 
protection; &#8213;protection&#8214;: the right of the child to be protected from all forms of violence, such as 
</p>
<p>maltreatment, abuse and exploitation; &#8213;participation&#8214;: the right of the child to be heard and involved 
in decision-making. </p>


<p>gender dimensions. The aim is to ensure to all children an adequate standard of 
living, social protection, the highest attainable standard of health, education, 
protection from maltreatment, abuse and exploitation, as well as the right to be heard 
and to be involved in decision making. 
</p>
<p><b>  Strategy for 2009-2011 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. The strategic objectives: 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mainstreaming and co-ordination 
</b></p>
<p>The programme should continue to promote the mainstreaming of children&#8216;s rights in all 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe policy areas and to co-ordinate all its activities. As a matter of priority, 
the child rights perspective should be integrated into the following policy areas: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>democracy</i>: promotion of children&#8216;s participation and development of tools to 
</p>
<p>involve children in good governance, including through training and capacity 
building of adults and young people; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>media</i>: promotion of measures to disseminate information on the rights of the child 
to children and the media; promotion of the necessary educational, legal and 
technical measures to prevent children&#8216;s exposure to violence and harmful content in 
the media and to empower children in the information society and enable them to 
protect themselves against the potential dangers of certain information and 
communication technologies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>family policies</i>: promotion of family policies in the best interests of the child, 
including parents&#8216; opportunities to reconcile family and work, and follow up to the 
</p>
<p>recommendation on policies to support positive parenting; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>health</i>: promote the exchange of experiences with regard to initiatives in health and 
medical care to increase the involvement of children and possibilities for them to 
express their opinion, their access to information, good care and to care adapted to 
their rights and needs. 
</p>
<p>To facilitate mainstreaming and co-ordination, the Council of Europe should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; establish an online clearing house on children&#8216;s rights at the Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>level, with the aim of ensuring that all those working with children have easy access 
to information concerning standards, decisions of monitoring bodies, policies, 
materials and measures originated within the Organisation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reinforce the link with both governments and non-governmental networks; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; consider organising a high-level conference in 2011, to review progress and decide 
future orientations for the programme. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Promotion of children&#8217;s access to justice<b> 
</b></p>
<p>In the area of the administration of justice, as in all other areas, the general principles of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child provide a decisive, normative and ethical approach 
to deal with children and ensure the protection of their rights: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; non-discrimination is instrumental to avoid the marginalisation, stigmatisation, 
traumatisation or punishment of any child for reasons such as birth, gender, 
economic status, race or disability; </p>


<p>&#8226; the best interests of the child are a primary consideration to guide any legislative, 
administrative or judicial decisions, to determine the way proceedings are conducted 
and to help in addressing any conflict of interests concerning the child; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the right of all children to life, survival and development should be clearly stated in 
legislation and become a primary concern for all policies affecting children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; child participation and the respect for the views of the child are a requirement in all 
decisions affecting the child, and also a corollary of the consideration of the child as 
a subject of rights. 
</p>
<p>The general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitute core 
indicators that can be used to assess the extent to which a justice system (whether national 
or international) is child friendly and effective in the protection  and fulfillment of 
children&#8216;s rights. These general principles are relevant in civil, criminal and administrative 
</p>
<p>matters, in immigration and refugee law when fundamental freedoms or economic or social 
rights are at stake, and they are valid for both national and international justice systems.  
</p>
<p>The Council of Europe should promote children&#8216;s access to justice notably through: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the drafting of European guidelines for a child-friendly justice at national level, 
including the issue of access to national justice; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; measures to improve children&#8216;s access to international justice and in particular to 
Council of Europe human rights monitoring mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the development of child-friendly information and education and professional 
training on children&#8216;s rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; encouraging member states to establish or develop national human rights institutions 
adapted to the rights and needs of children. 
</p>
<p><b>  Eradication of all forms of violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>The Council of Europe will take on the role of regional initiator and co-ordinator of 
national and regional initiatives to combat violence against children including corporal 
punishment of children in all settings and act as the European forum for follow-up to the 
recommendations contained in the UN Secretary-General&#8216;  study on violence against 
children.  
</p>
<p>In particular, the Council of Europe should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; implement and follow up the UN Secretary-General&#8216; study, in co-operation with the 
UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Violence against Children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; finalise the drafting of the European policy guidelines for national integrated 
strategies on violence against children and support the adoption and implementation 
of such strategies at national level; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote a cross-sectoral exchange of experiences between countries with regard to 
effective methods for protecting children from all forms of violence; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote ratification and implementation of relevant Council of Europe legal 
instruments and consider reviewing the list of children-related instruments with the 
view to evaluating their effectiveness; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; continue the campaign against corporal punishment of children launched in Croatia 
in June 2008 and also launch comprehensive awareness-raising actions to prevent 
and combat all other specific forms of violence, such as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; sexual exploitation and sexual abuse; </p>


<p>&#8226; trafficking of children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; violence in the name of honour and traditions affecting children. 
</p>

focus on particularly vulnerable children&#8214;). 
</p>
<p><b>  Participation of children and their influence in society 
</b></p>
<p>The Council of Europe should: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote children&#8216;s access to information concerning their rights and human rights 
education for children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reinforce co-operation between children&#8216;s rights programme and the youth sector, 
building upon the youth sector's expertise in the field of participation and making 
use of the platform offered by the European Youth Forum; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; promote awareness raising on the right of the child to participate in decision-making 
processes and facilitate the exchange of experience and good practices with regard 
to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; various forms and methods of achieving child participation and of promoting 
dialogue between decision makers at all levels on the one hand, and children 
and young people on the other; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; methods for children&#8216;s participation in individual decisions that concern 
</p>
<p>them, such as in courts, the social services, schools and health and medical 
care; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; positive parenting and family policies, acknowledging that child participation 
is  crucial, including in the home setting; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; examine the possibility to update existing recommendations of the Committee of 
Ministers on children&#8216;s participation and influence in society,c or envisage the 
possibility of a new recommendation on this subject; 
</p>

extract good practice and guidance for all those wishing to promote participation at 
local and national levels. 
</p>
<p><b>  Special focus on particularly vulnerable children 
</b></p>
<p>When developing, implementing and evaluating activities, due consideration should be 
given to the rights and needs of particularly vulnerable children, notably in the context of 
access to education, social, health and legal services, and participation. The following 
children will receive special attention:

<p><b>  Council of Europe Policy Guidelines on Integrated National 
Strategies for the Protection of Children from Violence 
adopted by the Committee of Ministers, November 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendation CM/Rec (2009)10 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Executive summary 
</b></p>
<p>In line with the recommendations of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and of the United Nations Secretary-General&#8216;s Study on Violence against Children, 
these guidelines promote the development and implementation of a holistic national 
framework to safeguard the rights of the child and to eradicate violence against children. 
</p>
<p>The guidelines refer to the definitions of &#8213;children&#8214; and &#8213;violence&#8214; as contained in Articles 
1 and 19, respectively, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(hereinafter referred to as UNCRC). 
</p>
<p>The guidelines are based on eight general principles (protection against violence, the right 
to life and maximum survival and development, non-discrimination, gender equality, child 
participation, a state&#8216;s obligations, other actors&#8216; obligations and participation, best interests 
</p>
<p>of the child) and four operative principles (multidimensional nature of violence, integrated 
approach, cross-sectoral co-operation, multi stakeholder approach). These have been 
mainstreamed throughout, including into sections on integrated national, regional and local 
action; education and awareness-raising measures; legal, policy and institutional 
frameworks; research and data collection. 
</p>
<p>The guidelines support the promotion of a culture of respect for the rights of the child, 
based on an in-depth knowledge of the rights of the child and an understanding of 
children&#8216;s vulnerabilities and capacities. The primary target group includes all relevant 
professionals in contact with children.  
</p>
<p>The guidelines&#8216; core recommendations call for the development of an integrated national 
</p>
<p>strategy for the protection of children from violence. The strategy is understood as a multi-
faceted and systematic framework fully integrated into a national policy for the promotion 
and protection of the rights of the child, with a specific timeframe, with realistic targets, co-
ordinated and monitored by a single agency (where possible, and in conformity with 
national regulations), supported by adequate human and financial resources and based on 
current scientific knowledge. 
</p>
<p>The guidelines encourage the setting up of child-friendly services and mechanisms. These 
are understood as safeguarding the rights of the child and pursuing children&#8216;s best interests. 
</p>
<p>An important recommendation calls for the mandatory reporting by all relevant 
professionals of incidents of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>The guidelines recommend strengthening international co-operation to prevent violence 
against children Europe-wide. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Aims, scope, definitions and principles 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2.1. Aims 
</b></p>
<p>The aims of these guidelines are to: 
</p>
<p>a. protect the rights of children, in particular those who are victims of violence; </p>


<p>b. prevent and combat all forms of violence against children; 
</p>
<p>c. promote the adoption, implementation and monitoring of integrated national 
strategies for the protection of children from violence; 
</p>
<p>d. reinforce international co-operation to safeguard the rights of the child and to protect 
children from violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.2. Scope and definitions</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. &#8213;Child&#8214; shall mean any person under the age of 18 years, including child victims, 
witnesses and perpetrators of violence. 
</p>
<p>2. In line with Article 19 of the UNCRC, &#8213;violence&#8214; is defined as including all forms 
of physical or mental violence, injury and abuse, neglect and negligent treatment, 
maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse.b This definition covers the exposure 
of children to violence in the home and elsewhere. Violence is understood to occur not only 
between adults and children but also between children. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.3. Principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Protection against violence 
</b></p>
<p>All children have the right to protection from all forms of physical or mental violence, 
injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including 
sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has 
the care of the child.c 
</p>
<p><i>  The right to life and maximum survival and development 
</i></p>
<p>Every child has the inherent right to life and to survival and development to the maximum 
extent possible.d 
</p>
<p><b>  Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>All children regardless of their sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth, 
sexual orientation, state of health, disability or other status, should be protected from all 
forms of violence and be provided with such care and assistance as to ensure to the 
maximum extent possible their survival and development. 
</p>
<p><b>  Gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>Gender aspects of violence should be addressed as part of the integrated approach to 
violence, and due account should be taken of the different risks girls and boys face in 
respect of violence and of the different consequences of violence for boys and girls. 
</p>
<p>  
 a Also, refer to Appendix 2 &#8211; Glossary of terms. 
 b Also, refer to the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
</p>
<p>the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Optional Protocol to the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p> c Article 19, UNCRC. 
 d Op. cit., Article 6. </p>


<p><b>  Child participation 
</b></p>
<p>1. Children have the right to express themselves freely on all matters affecting their 
lives, and their views should be given due weight depending on the child&#8216;s age and 
maturity.e 
</p>
<p>Child participation entails in particular: 
</p>
<p> a. supporting children&#8216;s expression of their views and respecting and taking into 
consideration the views of the child in all situations affecting her or him; 
</p>
<p> b. providing the child with the opportunity to be heard in any judicial, 
administrative or extrajudicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p>2. Children should be actively engaged in and empowered, according to their evolving 
capacity and with their informed consent, to participate meaningfully in the planning, 
implementation and evaluation of policies and programmes to prevent violence. The state 
and other appropriate actors should listen carefully to children&#8216;s views in the light of the 
</p>
<p>contribution that the child&#8216;s perspective can bring to the quality of solutions under 
examination. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>A state&#8217;s obligations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The state has the paramount responsibility to uphold the rights of the child and to 
protect all children within its jurisdiction from all forms of violence, however mild, at all 
times and in all settings.f States should invest in evidence-based policies and programmes, 
guided by the child&#8216;s best interests, to address factors that give rise to violence and to 
</p>
<p>respond effectively when violence occurs. 
</p>
<p>2. Recognising the central role that families play in children&#8216;s development and well-
being and in the safeguarding of their rights, including the right to protection from all forms 
of violence, the state should support families in their child-rearing role by: 
</p>
<p> a. providing for a network of accessible, flexible and quality childcare services;g 
</p>
<p> b. facilitating positive reconciliation of family and working life; 
</p>
<p> c. drawing up programmes to improve parental skills and to foster a healthy and 
positive family environment;h 
</p>
<p> d. incorporating a child rights perspective at all levels of the budgetary process. 
</p>
<p> Other actors&#8217; obligations and participation </p>
<p>The responsibility to prevent violence against children also extends to all services, 
institutions and professionals working for and with children, parents and the extended 
family, the media, private sector, religious communities and civil society. 
</p>
<p><i>  Best interests of the child 
</i></p>
<p>In all actions affecting children, including those to protect them from all forms of violence, 
the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration. 
</p>
<p>  
 e Op. cit, Article 12 
 f Ibid., Article 19. 
 g Refer to Recommendation Rec(2002)8 of the Committee of Ministers on child day-care. 
 h Refer to Recommendation Rec(2006)19 of the Committee of Ministers on policy to support positive 
</p>
<p>parenting. </p>


<p><b>  Operative principles 
</b></p>
<p>1. Violence against children is multidimensional. This approach presupposes that a 
combination of factors needs to come into play in order for violence to occur, recur, or 
cease. It calls for holistic treatment of the circumstances of the violent incident, on the basis 
of their interdependence, not dealing with a single cause and effect relationship. 
</p>
<p>2. Prevention of violence requires cross-sectoral co-operation and co-ordination. This 
involves, in particular, co-ordination across central government departments, across 
provinces and regions, and between government and civil society. 
</p>
<p>3. Violence against children demands an integrated (systemic, holistic) approach. This 
approach allows factors of different orders (cultural, psychological, pedagogical, 
behavioural, physical, political, socio economic, etc.) to be treated on the basis of common 
ground. It implies that all programmes and actions aimed at preventing and protecting 
children from violence, in the broad context of the promotion of the rights of the child, 
should operate across a range of disciplines and sectors. In the same spirit, the guidelines&#8216; 
</p>
<p>sections are interrelated and should be read in conjunction with each other. 
</p>
<p>4. A multi-stakeholder approach is indispensable for the eradication of violence against 
children, as this is a responsibility that extends beyond state-controlled bodies and services 
to include all members of society, such as state institutions, local authorities, non-
governmental organisations, professionals, the media, families and children. In the 
planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes and actions to protect children 
from violence priority should be attached to: 
</p>
<p> a. building partnerships between families and the state, based on trust and 
respect for different cultures and traditions; 
</p>
<p> b. engaging in true dialogue with children and progressively building a culture 
of respect for children&#8216;s views, including by informing them of the outcome of the 
processes and explaining how their views were taken into account. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Integrated national, regional and local action 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3.1. Integrated national strategies for the protection of children from violence 
</b></p>
<p>1. A multidisciplinary and systematic framework (hereinafter referred to as &#8213;the 
strategy&#8214;) integrated into the national planning process, rooted in the UNCRC and bringing 
</p>
<p>together all stakeholders, represents the most effective response to violence against children 
that is sustainable over time. The strategy&#8216;s core element should be a complex of effective 
and comprehensive primary, secondary and tertiary prevention measuresi  that are child-
centred, families-focused, multidisciplinary and oriented towards fulfilling children&#8216;s and 
families&#8216; needs. The strategy should contain realistic and time-bound targets, be supported 
by adequate human and financial resources, be based on current scientific knowledge (with 
regard to what works) and be systematically evaluated. 
</p>
<p>  
 i Preventive work directed at society at large is known as primary prevention. It prevents violence by 
</p>
<p>addressing broad issues, such as health or education, and reduces risk factors, such as unemployment 
and social exclusion. Children who run a high risk of being subjected to violence or inflicting 
violence upon others are targets of secondary prevention. Its examples include measures for children 
of drug or alcohol abusers, etc. Tertiary prevention attempts to prevent, reverse or limit the 
consequences of violence that has already occurred. It focuses on victims&#8216; and perpetrators&#8216; 
rehabilitation and re-integration. </p>


<p>2. The strategy should rely on cross-sectoral co-operation and co-ordination involving 
health, education and social sectors, agencies responsible for planning and budgetary 
appropriations, law enforcement authorities, and the justice system. At national level, an 
agency with primary responsibility for the protection of children against violence should 
assume (where possible and in conformity with national regulations) a key co-ordinating 
and monitoring role. Its capacity to involve multiple sectors in a broad-based action is 
crucial for the strategy&#8216;s long-term success. 
</p>
<p>3. All actors concerned with the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, 
such as national, regional and local authorities, families, independent human rights 
institutions, professionals working for and with children, researchers, civil society and the 
media should be involved in the strategy&#8216;s design, implementation and evaluation. Children 
</p>
<p>should not only be heard but be empowered to contribute, with their informed consent and 
according to their evolving capacity, to this multi-stakeholder action. Adequate resources 
should be made available to ensure children&#8216;s meaningful participation. 
</p>
<p>4. Methodologies should be developed to assess progress and evaluate actions foreseen 
by the strategy at all levels, including the cross-sectoral level. Evaluations should be 
conducted on a regular basis with a view to identifying policies and measures that are 
appropriate and effective in preventing and addressing violence. 
</p>
<p>5. Information on the strategy&#8216;s implementation should be widely disseminated. The 
visibility of actions taken to prevent and to address violence should be increased, <i>inter alia</i>, 
through their discussion in elected fora at national, regional and local levels. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.2. Regional and local action 
</b></p>
<p>1. Local action to prevent violence is particularly important in view of its proximity to 
children and families as end recipients of services. It is at this level that the persons 
concerned will receive assistance, in line with their needs and characteristics. 
</p>
<p>2. Whereas national authorities set forth common standards for service provision, it is 
the regions&#8216; and municipalities&#8216; obligation to adhere to these standards and to provide for a 
</p>
<p>network of childfriendly services and mechanisms. Responsibilities of regional and local 
authorities also include the collection of data on violence against children; the development, 
implementation and monitoring of preventive measures; funding and allocation of 
premises; etc. 
</p>
<p>3. National and regional authorities should provide adequate support to local violence 
prevention programmes in terms of financing, training, evaluation and follow-up. Co-
operation and coordination among these levels are indispensable for constant improvements 
in service delivery and resource optimisation. 
</p>
<p>4. Community interventions to prevent violence against children, involving all sectors 
and stakeholders, should be supported. Such interventions could be effected via open 
platforms, councils or networks bringing together, for instance, municipal authorities, social 
and health care services, schools, local judiciary, police, migrants&#8216; or community 
associations, faith-based organisations and children and families.j 
</p>
<p>5. Co-operation and co-ordination between municipalities (and regions) should be 
reinforced, including through the exchange of experiences and good practices. 
</p>
<p>  
 j Also refer to the handbook &#8213;Preventing school violence: a handbook for local partnerships&#8214; (Council 
</p>
<p>of Europe, 2005). </p>


<p>6. The appropriately regulated and monitored involvement of the private sector and of 
nongovernmental organisations should be promoted. 
</p>
<p>7. As large-scale decentralisation and privatisation of social services are now common 
in European states, the capacity of regional and local authorities to contribute to the 
strategy&#8216;s implementation should be carefully assessed. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Building a culture of respect for the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>The strategy should have as its main objective the qualitative change in the perception of 
children and childhood, and of violence against children. This objective can only be 
achieved when all segments of society have become sufficiently aware of the rights of the 
child and of the harmful impact of violence on children; when organisational cultures and 
practices have been strengthened in this regard, and bridges built across professions to 
afford more and better protection to children; when mindsets have been transformed, 
including through the means of information and communication technologies; when the 
underlying economic and social conditions associated with violence have been addressed &#8211; 
in other words it is only possible when a genuine culture of respect for the rights of the 
child has permeated the fabric of society. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.1. Education and awareness raising 
</b></p>
<p>1. It is the state&#8216;s obligation to make information on the rights of the child widely 
known, by appropriate and active means, to children and adults alike.k This entails in 
particular:  
</p>
<p> a. incorporating the rights of the child into school curricula and promoting a 
child rights approach in education at all levels; 
</p>
<p> b. regular and ongoing training on the rights of the child for all those who work 
with and for children; 
</p>
<p> c. raising awareness, by means of public information and media campaigns, on 
the rights of the child, including the right to be protected from all forms of violence, the 
right to respect for human dignity and physical integrity and the right to be heard and taken 
seriously. 
</p>
<p>2. A clear and unequivocal intolerance of all forms of violence against children, 
however mild, should be promoted throughout society. Public attitudes rooted in social and 
cultural norms and traditions which accept, condone or support violence, including 
stereotypical gender roles, racial or ethnic discrimination, acceptance of corporal 
punishment and other harmful traditional practices should be publicly condemned and 
eliminated. The harmful effects that all forms of violence have on children should be made 
widely known. An understanding of the state&#8216;s obligations and the individual&#8216;s 
responsibility to condemn and prevent violence and to assist child victims should be 
reinforced. 
</p>
<p>3. Parents&#8216; and carers&#8216; knowledge of the rights of the child and of positive parenting 
practices should be strengthened by all means, including encouraging their enrolment in 
positive parenting programmes.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>  
 k Article 42, UNCRC. </p>


<p><b> 4.2. Professional training 
</b></p>
<p>1. The training of professionals working for and with children represents an important 
long-term investment in children&#8216;s development and well-being. Therefore, the state and 
society should value these professions by attributing to them the requisite moral, financial 
and other forms of public and private support. 
</p>
<p>2. It is the state&#8216;s obligation to instil the culture of the rights of the child and 
responsibility for children into all professionals who come into contact with children 
through their work (for example, social workers, foster carers, police officers, judges, 
teachers, school principals, youth workers, people employed by detention facilities and 
child-care institutions, immigration and humanitarian workers, sports coaches, etc.). To 
promote knowledge of the rights of the child, relevant courses should be integrated into 
university and other training curricula. 
</p>
<p>3. All relevant professionals who in their work come in contact with children should be 
familiar with the UNCRC and methodologies and approaches, including those required for 
listening effectively to children, and be trained to work in a diverse ethnic, cultural, 
religious and linguistic environment. 
</p>
<p>4. All relevant professionals should have skills to prevent, detect and respond 
effectively to violence against children. To this end, national curriculum regulations should 
include compulsory, ongoing training on the prevention, identification, assessment and 
reporting of violence against children, and the protection and continuity of care of children. 
The training should pursue a comprehensive approach and prioritise early identification of 
potential risks to a child&#8216;s well-being. 
</p>
<p>5. Specialised training should be offered to professionals working for and with 
vulnerable groups of children, such as children with disabilities.l 
</p>
<p>6. Bearing in mind the often difficult physical and psychological environment 
surrounding services assisting children affected by violence, adequate support should be 
rendered to their staff in terms of supervision, counselling, complementary training and the 
possibility of setting up professional interest groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.3. Media and the information society 
</b></p>
<p>1. Free and independent media, with due respect for their self-regulation, can play a 
powerful role in building a culture of respect for the rights of the child and act as a natural 
partner in the strategy&#8216;s implementation. The media should be encouraged to educate both 
children and adults in the rights of the child, promote child participation, foster positive 
parenting practices, strengthen intercultural and interfaith dialogue, and foster non-violent 
values in society.m 
</p>
<p>  
 l Refer to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and to 
</p>
<p>Recommendation Rec(2006)5 of the Committee of Ministers on the Council of Europe Action Plan to 
promote the rights and full participation of people with disabilities in society: improving the quality 
of life of people with disabilities in Europe 2006-2015. 
</p>
<p> m Refer to Recommendation No. R (97) 19 of the Committee of Ministers on the portrayal of violence 
in electronic media and Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1466 (2000) on 
&#8213;Media education&#8214;. </p>


<p>2. The state bears the primary responsibility for the protection of children against 
harmful media content and for the promotion of children&#8216;s active participation in the 
</p>
<p>information and communications environment.n 
</p>
<p>3. With regard to the portrayal of violence and the distribution of content potentially 
harmful to children, those responsible for the media should fully assume their duties and 
responsibilities which the exercise of their freedom of expression entails. This could be 
done through the removal of or blocking access to inappropriate material, or through the 
development of automated content rating systems, the adoption of codes of conduct and 
standards for content evaluation, the setting up of control mechanisms, the establishment of 
content complaints systems, etc.o 
</p>
<p>4. In order to meet children&#8216;s and families&#8216; expectations for accessible, secure and 
reliable Internet services, Internet service providers should be encouraged to supply 
information on potential risks to their customers&#8216; rights, security and privacy online.p Co-
operation with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of crimes committed 
through the use of telecommunication technologies should be strengthened.q 
</p>
<p>5. Given the potential impact of online games on the rights and sensibilities of 
children, game designers and publishers should be encouraged to regularly evaluate policies 
and practices regarding child safety.r 
</p>
<p>6. The media should be encouraged to build partnerships with all relevant actors in 
order to: 
</p>
<p> a. develop children&#8216;s media literacy skills;s 
</p>
<p> b. work with child safety experts, policy makers, social services and law 
enforcement authorities to develop, incorporate and monitor the application of new 
technologies to protect children from harm online; 
</p>
<p> c. raise media professionals&#8216; awareness of the rights of the child and of violence 
against children. 
</p>
<p>7. Parents and teachers have a special responsibility as far as children&#8216;s access to and 
the use of the media at home and in school is concerned. They may assume this 
responsibility in various ways, including by conscious and selective use of the media,

</p>
<p><b> 5. Frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5.1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Compliance with UNCRC and other international standards 
</b></p>
<p>1. All member states of the Council of Europe are parties to the UNCRC and are bound 
to implement its provisions and to act in accordance with its principles. All reservations 
incompatible with the UNCRC&#8216;s object and purpose should be withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>2. At global and regional levels numerous instruments have been adopted to safeguard 
the rights of the child and to protect children from various forms of violence. t Accession to 
these treaties should be strongly encouraged. Once ratified, they should be effectively 
implemented and monitored, and national laws, bylaws, policies, regulations, plans and 
programmes should be brought in line with them. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>The national legal framework should prioritise the prevention of violence and safeguard the 
rights of the child by taking action, such as: 
</p>
<p> a. registering children immediately after birth, subject to national regulations 
and state obligations under the relevant international treaties in this field;u 
</p>
<p> b. setting a minimum age of marriage that is not too low and that is applicable 
to both boys and girls; 
</p>
<p> c. setting a minimum age for sexual consent; 
</p>
<p> d. prohibiting employment into positions involving child supervision of persons 
convicted of violent, including sexual, offences against children; 
</p>
<p> e. developing intervention programmes and measures to evaluate and prevent 
the risk of violence against children from being committed;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> f. devising a system to vet fully those working with children, in any capacity, 
that ensures an appropriate balance between the child&#8216;s right to protection from violence 
</p>
<p>and the individual&#8216;s right to a good name;v 
</p>
<p> g. integrating in national laws an obligation to respect the right of the child to be 
heard and to attribute due weight to children&#8216;s views. 
</p>
<p>  
 t The non-exhaustive list of relevant international treaties appears in Appendix 3. Appendix 4 presents 
</p>

<p><b>  Prohibition of violence 
</b></p>
<p>The state has an explicit obligation to secure children&#8216;s right to protection from all forms of 
violence, however mild. Appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational 
measures should be taken to prohibit all violence against children at all times and in all 
settings and to render protection to all children within the state&#8216;s jurisdiction. Legal 
defences and authorisations for any form of violence, including for the purposes of 
correction, discipline or punishment, within or outside families, should be repealed.w 
</p>
<p>Prohibition should imperatively cover: 
</p>
<p> a. all forms of sexual violence and abuse, corruption of children and solicitation 
of children for sexual purposes; 
</p>
<p> b. all forms of exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child 
pornography, sexual exploitation in travel and tourism, trafficking, sale of children, illegal 
adoption, forced labour or services, slavery and practices similar to it, removal of organs, 
for any purpose or in any form;x 
</p>
<p> c. all forms of exploitation of children through the use of new technologies; 
</p>
<p> d. all harmful traditional or customary practices, such as early or forced 
marriage, honour killing and female genital mutilation; e. exposure of children to violent or 
harmful content, irrespective of its origin and through any medium; 
</p>
<p> f. all forms of violence in residential institutions;y 
</p>

<p><b>  Sanctions and measures 
</b></p>
<p>1. Violent, including sexual, offences against children should be punishable by 
effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions and measures, taking into account the 
seriousness of the offence.aa 
</p>
<p>2. Those convicted of violent, including sexual, offences against children, as well as 
those subject to criminal proceedings should be provided with access to effective 
intervention programmes and measures with a view to preventing and minimising the risks 
of repeated offences.bb 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with the principles of social integration and education and of the 
prevention of reoffending, any justice system dealing with child perpetrators of violence 
should be integrated with wider social initiatives aimed at ensuring a holistic approach to 
and continuity of care of such children (principle of community involvement and 
continuous care).cc 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with its basic principles, the national legal system should provide for 
a possibility of not imposing penalties on child victims of violence for their involvement in 
unlawful activities, to the extent that they have been compelled to do so. 
</p>
<p><b>  Aggravating circumstances 
</b></p>
<p>Resorting to violence against children should be taken into consideration as an aggravating 
circumstance in the determination of a sanction. Other circumstances to be taken into 
account, in so far as they do not already form part of the constituent elements of the 
offence, should include the abuse of a recognised position of trust, authority or influence 
over the child, of a relationship based on economic or any other form of dependence, and 
the involvement in a criminal organisation.dd 
</p>
<p><b>  Jurisdiction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Necessary legislative or other measures should be taken to establish jurisdiction over 
violent, including sexual, offences against children who are the state&#8216;s nationals or have 
</p>
<p>their habitual residence on the state&#8216;s territory. 
</p>
<p>2. Subject to international treaties&#8216; requirements, necessary legislative or other 
measures should be taken to establish national jurisdiction over violent, including sexual, 
offences against children committed abroad by the state&#8216;s nationals and persons who have 
</p>
<p>their habitual residence on the state&#8216;s territory.ee To ensure effective extraterritorial 
legislation, prosecution of perpetrators and imposition of sanctions, the requirement of 
double criminality should be abolished and mutual legal assistance facilitated. 
</p>
<p><b>  Statute of limitation 
</b></p>
<p>With regard to offences identified by Article 33 of the Council of Europe Convention on 
the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, the statute of

<p>limitation should continue for a period of time which is sufficient to allow the efficient 
starting of proceedings after the child victim has reached the age of majority and which is 
commensurate with the gravity of the crime in question. 
</p>
<p><b>  Enforcement 
</b></p>
<p>Legislation safeguarding the rights of the child and protecting children from all forms of 
violence should be fully and appropriately enforced. To that effect, it should be supported 
by relevant institutions, including independent national institutions for the rights of the 
child and independent monitoring mechanisms, human and financial resources, and be 
accompanied by guidance to all relevant sectors and professionals.ff 
</p>
<p><b> 5.2. Policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National child rights policy 
</b></p>
<p>1. The existence of a national child rights policy is crucial for the realisation of the 
child&#8216;s right to be protected from all forms of violence. Such a policy initiates, promotes 
and co-ordinates processes aimed at ensuring that the provisions and principles of the 
UNCRC permeate all aspects of government policy and all public actions affecting 
children. 
</p>
<p>2. All national policies relevant to children&#8216;s well-being (social policy, health care 
policy, educational policy, housing policy, etc.) should contribute to the promotion and 
protection of the rights of the child. Priority should be attached to policies aimed at 
reducing inequality, poverty and marginalisation; supporting families; addressing 
unemployment and income gaps; addressing social tolerance, beliefs and values that 
condone and sustain violence; improving social networks; facilitating social inclusion of 
migrants and their families. Policies and measures developed in related areas should be 
properly co-ordinated, and their outputs should be mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p>3. Policies, based on research, evidence, and children&#8216;s own experiences, should be 
developed to prevent, detect and respond to violence against children. Particular attention 
should be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups, such as children with disabilities,gg 
children in or having experienced state care,hh children in foster care, abandoned children,ii 
unaccompanied and separated children,jj refugee and asylum seeking children,kk children 
belonging to minorities, children working and/or living on the street,ll children living in 
</p>
<p>  
 ff See the case law of the European Court of Human Rights including <i>A. v. the United Kingdom</i>, 1998, 
</p>
<p>and <i>Z and Others v. the United Kingdom</i>, 2001, which require states to ensure adequate legal 
protection of children from treatment that is inhuman and degrading contrary to Article 3 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights.

emergency situations,nn children in detention or in conflict with the law,oo etc. 
</p>
<p><b>  Children and families policies 
</b></p>
<p>1. The overall goal of children and families policies should be: 
</p>
<p> a. to support families in their child-rearing responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> b.  to prevent, as far as possible, the separation of children from their families; 
</p>
<p> c. to provide for family-like and community-based alternatives to placement of 
children in institutions that are in the children&#8216;s best interests; and 
</p>
<p> d. in cases of separation and, when appropriate, to ensure ongoing contact 
between children and their parents and to support family reunification where that is in the 
best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p>2. The promotion of positive and non-violent forms of child-rearing should be central 
to children and families policies. Positive parenting refers to parental behaviour that 
respects the rights of the child and children&#8216;s best interests, nurtures, empowers, guides and 
</p>
<p>recognises children as individuals in their own right. Positive parenting is not permissive 
but sets the boundaries that children need to help them develop their potential to the full.pp 
</p>
<p>3. Institutionalised care should be used only in a child&#8216;s best interests, as a matter of 
last resort, for the shortest possible period of time, and have as the primary objective the 
child&#8216;s successful integration and/or re-integration in society.qq Children can be placed in 
institutions only to meet needs that have been established as imperative on the basis of a 
multidisciplinary assessment. 
</p>
<p><b> 5.3. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>1. The sustainable institutional framework required for the strategy&#8216;s realisation should 
comprise the following key elements: 
</p>
<p> a. an agency at national level (where possible and in accordance with national 
regulations) entrusted with the primary responsibility for the protection of children from 
violence. This authority should play a key co-ordinating and monitoring function as far as 
the strategy&#8216;s implementation is concerned and assume overall responsibility in cases of 
</p>
<p>violence against children; 
</p>
<p> b. each public institution contributing to child protection should have a clearly 
defined role consistent with the strategy&#8216;s broader goals. Institutions&#8216; mandates should have 
</p>
<p>a clear obligation to collaborate with the co-ordinating agency and all other institutions and

<p>above. </p>


<p>actors, including civil society. The different institutions&#8216; mandates and the job descriptions 
</p>
<p>of their staff should be linked; 
</p>
<p> c. an independent human rights institution should be established in line with the 
Paris principlesrr to promote and protect the rights of the child (for example, an 
ombudsperson/commissioner specifically for the rights of the child, established through 
legislation, either independently or as a focal point within an existing human rights 
institution). This institution should be accorded such powers as are necessary to enable it to 
discharge its mandate effectively and independently, including the power to hear any 
person; obtain any information and/or document necessary for assessing situations falling 
within its competence; access facilities providing care for children at all times; propose 
initiatives and measures, including legislative measures; conduct awareness-raising 
campaigns; disseminate information on the rights of the child, to children in particular; and 
monitor governments&#8216; actions. The institution should be provided with an adequate 
infrastructure, funding (including specifically for the rights of the child, within broad-based 
institutions), staff and premises. It should be associated with the strategy&#8216;s design, 
</p>
<p>evaluation and follow-up; 
</p>
<p> d. a body, such as an observatory on the rights of the child, a national statistical 
office or a research institute dealing with children should co-ordinate the collection, 
analysis management and dissemination of data on violence and promote research to inform 
the strategy&#8216;s design and implementation; 
</p>
<p> e. all institutions providing care and services for children should be accredited 
and registered with competent public authorities on the basis of relevant legislation and 
national minimum standards of care. Internal control and independent monitoring 
mechanisms should be put in place to ensure compliance with the standards; 
</p>
<p> f. all institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care and protection 
of children should be encouraged to adopt codes of good conduct, incorporating the 
prohibition, prevention and rejection of all forms of violence against children, and be 
expected to adhere fully to these codes. Model job descriptions should be established for 
each professional category. They should contain an obligation to respect the rights of the 
child and to report violence to competent authorities; 
</p>
<p> g. the necessary links should be established between institutions at national, 
regional and local levels, and effective partnerships should be built, based on the clear 
division of competencies fixed in respective partnership agreements; 
</p>
<p> h. civil society should become an integral part of the institutional framework, 
and actors, such as human rights institutions, professional networks, children and children&#8216;s 
organisations, should be invited to contribute to the strategy&#8216;s design, implementation, 
</p>
<p>evaluation and follow-up. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Child-friendly services and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6.1. General principles 
</b></p>
<p>1. The prime objective of institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care, 
education and protection of children should be to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, 
children&#8216;s survival, development and well-being.ss 
</p>
<p>  
 rr UN General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993. 
 ss Refer to Article 6, UNCRC. </p>


<p>2. All children should have access to quality services adapted to their needs. The use of 
multidisciplinary models of services, comprising welfare, health, educational and 
psychological assistance and family guidance should be widely promoted. Such models 
should rely on strong intersectoral co-operation, appropriately qualified staff, an integrated 
curriculum, and a centralised implementation framework. 
</p>
<p>3. Services for the prevention of violence, the protection of children and the treatment 
of victims should be made available particularly at local level. Reliable procedures and 
mechanisms, including for the exchange of relevant information and best practice, should 
be put in place through interagency agreements and protocols. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.2. Child care standards 
</b></p>
<p>1. Regulations should be established for all institutions, services and facilities 
responsible for the care, education and protection of children, setting standards aimed at the 
best interests and full development of the child.tt Respect for these standards should be 
ensured through training of staff, internal control and regular independent monitoring. Any 
infringements of the rights of the child in such establishments should be sanctioned in 
conformity with appropriate and effective procedures. 
</p>
<p>2. Specific requirements should apply to the juvenile justice system and facilities 
providing institutionalised care to ensure that the rights of the child are fully protected, 
children enjoy a good quality of life and there are opportunities for them to participate in all 
activities normally enjoyed by their peers.uu 
</p>
<p>3. A system should be put in place to vet fully those working in contact with children, 
in any capacity, that ensures an appropriate balance between the child&#8216;s right to protection 
</p>
<p>from violence and the individual&#8216;s right to a good name. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.3. Independent monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>1. All institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care, education and 
protection of children should be subject to regular independent monitoring with a view to: 
</p>
<p> a. providing legal safeguards for both children and staff that are fully observed; 
</p>
<p> b. verifying the appropriateness and correctness of public expenditure; 
</p>
<p> c. supplying guidance on the execution of child welfare laws and regulations. 
</p>
<p>2. Monitoring should be performed by an independent body determined by law and 
staffed with specially trained personnel. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.4. Reporting of violence 
</b></p>
<p>1. Education on the rights of the child and the knowledge and understanding of 
authorities to whom violence can be reported are two essential conditions enabling wider 
reporting of violence by both children and adults. To be truly effective, the reporting 
mechanism should be child-friendly and part of a broader system comprising reporting, 
referral and support services. Such a system should respect the rights of the child and offer 
children (and, where appropriate, their families) the necessary protection, including the 
protection of their privacy, without undue delay. 
</p>
<p>  
 tt Also refer to Article 3, UNCRC, the UN Guidelines for the appropriate use and conditions for 
</p>
<p>alternative care, and to Committee of Ministers&#8216; Recommendation Rec(2002)8, cited above. 
 uu Also refer to Recommendations Rec(2003)20 of the Committee of Ministers concerning new ways of 
</p>
<p>dealing with juvenile delinquency and the role of juvenile justice, and Rec(2005)5, cited above. </p>


<p>2. Reporting of violence should be mandatory for all professionals working for and 
with children, including those in organisations and private entities performing tasks on 
behalf of the state. Where mandatory reporting already exists, the extent to which various 
agencies fulfil their reporting obligations should be examined and kept under regular 
review. 
</p>
<p>3. To encourage wider reporting by professionals, legislative changes can be 
introduced in order to: 
</p>
<p> a. protect those who report or initiate complaints from liability in cases of 
reasonable mistakes in the assessment of the risk of violence; 
</p>
<p> b. remove a requirement to obtain parents&#8216; or carers&#8216; permission to file a 
complaint; 
</p>
<p> c. ensure that confidentiality norms do not hamper the reporting where the child 
consents, or is judged not to have the capacity to understand, and where professionals 
believe reporting or referring is in the child&#8216;s best interests. 
</p>
<p>4. Children and their families should have access to information, including in a child-
friendly format, on what acts and practices constitute violence, for instance bullying and 
mobbing in schools, and to whom and how these cases could be reported. A child should be 
able to file a report without the consent of her or his parent or guardian. 
</p>
<p>5. Every service, institution or facility responsible for the care, education and 
protection of children should have a well-publicised and easily accessible service, 
respectful of the child&#8216;s privacy and be required to investigate allegations of violence 
promptly and fully. All children, including those in care in a legal establishment, as well as 
children with disabilities,vv their parents and carers should be informed of such complaint 
mechanisms. The procedure should allow for effective access to support services while 
avoiding any stigmatisation of the child victim. 
</p>
<p>6. An independent, confidential, well-advertised, easy to memorise, toll-free telephone 
help line should be made available for children to seek confidential and professional 
counselling and to report violence. 
</p>
<p>7. Emergency response services should be established in every locality for child 
victims of violence, including victims of sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, harmful 
traditional practices and all forms of violence in the home and family. The services&#8216; contact 
</p>
<p>details should be made known to children, families and others in contact with children. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.5. Referral mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>1. Procedures for the referral of child victims of violence and the modalities for inter-
agency cooperation should be clearly defined (that is, between social services, education, 
health, police, prosecution authorities, voluntary and private agencies). Such procedures 
should be adopted following an assessment of the specific circumstances of each particular 
victim, giving due weight to her or his views and, when it is in the child&#8216;s best interests, 
</p>
<p>also to her or his parents&#8216; or guardian&#8216;s views.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Children should be encouraged, including through the provision of independent 
advocacy and support services, to speak to the relevant authority about their experience of 
violence. 
</p>
<p>  
 vv Not only children with physical disabilities such as those with visual impairment, but also children 
</p>
<p>with intellectual disabilities. For information on &#8213;easy to read&#8214; format suitable for persons with 
mental handicap, see http://www.osmhi.org/?page=139 </p>


<p>3. Child victims should be assessed without delay, and for victims of violence within 
the home and family, the protective capacity of the non-violent caregiver and the situation 
of other children living in the home should be established. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.6. Recovery, rehabilitation and social reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>1. The state should take all appropriate measures to promote physical and 
psychological recovery and rehabilitation of child victims and witnesses of violenceww and, 
if need be, of their families. Such services should be provided without delay and in an 
environment which fosters the child&#8216;s health, self-respect and dignity. 
</p>
<p>2. The implementation of recovery and reintegration measures for child perpetrators of 
violence should be based on the child&#8216;s best interests, limited by the gravity of the offence 
</p>
<p>committed (principle of proportionality) and take account of the age, physical and mental 
well-being, development, capacities and personal circumstances (principle of 
individualisation), as ascertained when necessary by psychological, psychiatric or social 
inquiry reports.xx 
</p>
<p>3. The services responsible for the recovery, rehabilitation and social reintegration of 
child victims, witnesses or perpetrators of violence should follow a multidisciplinary and 
multi-agency approach, seeing the child in the wider context of family, community and her 
or his cultural background. A proper balance should be sought between mainstream and 
specialised services, as well as programmes addressing individual and relationship factors 
and those focusing on community and societal aspects. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.7. The justice system
yy
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. Judicial and extra-judicial proceedings should be pursued in the best interests and in 
full respect of the rights of the child, including the right to be protected from all forms of 
violence. 
</p>
<p>2. To protect the rights of the child and children&#8216;s legitimate interests throughout the 
process, children should be granted access to mediation, free and independent legal 
services, and advocacy and support services. Efforts should be made to ensure that the 
remedies available are effective and that there is effective enforcement of judicial decisions 
and judgments. 
</p>
<p>3. Judicial and extra-judicial proceedings involving children should be expedited, 
treated as a priority and be completed without unjustified delay. To this end, stronger co-
operation and co-ordination among all parties to the judicial process should be 
encouraged.7 
</p>
<p>4. Judicial and extra-judicial proceedings should respect the child&#8216;s right to be heard 
and to have her<b> </b>or his views given due weight. To allow their meaningful participation, 
children should be informed<b> </b>about their procedural rights in a manner which takes full 
account of their age and level of maturity<b> </b>and supported by an independent representative.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
 ww Refer to Article 39, UNCRC and to Committee of Ministers&#8216; Recommendation Rec(2003)20, cited 
</p>

 yy In 2009 the Group of Specialists on Child-Friendly Justice (CJ-S-CH) drafted Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on child-friendly justice. The guidelines will be adopted as a Committee of Ministers&#8216; 
recommendation in 2010. </p>


<p>5. Special protection, procedures and facilities should be provided to ensure child 
victims and witnesses of violence are fully supported. In particular: 
</p>
<p> a. judicial proceedings should not aggravate the trauma experienced by the 
child. Where appropriate, the justice response should be followed swiftly by adequate 
support services; 
</p>
<p> b. the privacy of children and of their families should be protected throughout 
the process.zz Where necessary, appropriate security measures should be taken to avoid 
intimidation, subjection to retaliation or repeat victimisation of child victims and witnesses 
of violence and of their families. 
</p>
<p>6. The age of criminal responsibility should be determined by law and be set suitably 
high, bearing in mind factors related to the child&#8216;s development. For child perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>violence, concepts of retribution and repression should give way to rehabilitation and 
restorative justice objectives, with due attention to effective public safety and appropriate 
human rights and legal safeguards for the child victims.aaa 
</p>
<p>7. Alternatives to institutionalised care for child perpetrators of violence should be 
established, such as help, guidance and supervision orders; counselling; probation; foster 
care; and educational and vocational training programmes. The overall objective of such 
measures should be to facilitate children&#8216;s successful socialisation and reintegration in the 
</p>
<p>family, the community and society. 
</p>
<p>8. Child perpetrators of violence should not be deprived of their liberty other than 
where it is necessary as a measure of last resort, used for the shortest period of time and 
takes place in specially designed premises. The conditions of the detention should be in 
conformity with the UNCRC and other relevant standards and take into account children&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>specific needs.bbb Children undergoing any form of detention should be detained separately 
from adults, unless this is considered to be contrary to their best interests.ccc 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Research and data 
</b></p>
<p>1. Identification of an effective strategy for the protection of children from violence 
depends on the availability and proper analysis of data at national, regional and local levels. 
The adoption of a national research agenda represents the most appropriate way of 
promoting an integrated and systematic approach to data collection, analysis, dissemination 
and research. This approach, inter alia, implies the following: 
</p>
<p><b>  Research 
</b></p>
<p> a. baseline study on violence against children as a prerequisite to any strategic 
planning process;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> b. ethical and regular research involving interviews with children and separately 
with their parents or carers, in conditions of confidentiality and trust, to establish as 
accurately as possible the actual experience of violence by children;

</p>
<p><b>  Statistical monitoring 
</b></p>
<p> a. regular statistical monitoring, on the basis of established methodology, of 
violence against children at national, regional and local levels in all settings. The data 
should be broken down by gender, age, form of violence, urban or rural household, 
families&#8216; characteristics, level of education and national, social and ethnic origin; 
</p>

against children in such institutions; 
</p>
<p> c. on persons convicted of violent offences against children, including their 
genetic profile (DNA).eee

related data nationwide and exchange information internationally; 
</p>
<p> b. active contribution by all agencies with a child protection role to data 
collection. 
</p>
<p>2. All institutions, services and facilities recruiting personnel to work for and with 
children should be afforded easy but appropriately controlled access to data on persons 
convicted of violent offences against children.

</p>
<p>4. Internationally agreed uniform standards should be established to facilitate 
international comparability of data. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. International co-operation 
</b></p>
<p>1. Member states of the Council of Europe should co-operate with each other, in 
accordance with these guidelines and through application of relevant international and 
regional instruments and arrangements agreed on the basis of uniform or reciprocal 
legislation and internal laws, to the widest extent possible, for the purpose of: 
</p>
<p> a. preventing and combating all forms of violence against children; 
</p>
<p> b. protecting and assisting child victims and witnesses; 
</p>
<p> c. investigating or prosecuting criminal offences involving violence against 
children. 
</p>
<p>2. Member states should afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance in 
proceedings on offences involving violence against children, such as child abductions, 
trafficking in children, sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children. 
</p>
<p>3. To facilitate implementation of the guidelines, member states should strengthen, as 
appropriate, co-operation within relevant intergovernmental bodies, transnational networks 
and other international organisations. 
</p>
<p>4. Each member state should endeavour to integrate, where appropriate, prevention and 
eradication of all forms of violence against children into development assistance 
programmes provided for the benefit of third countries.

<p>  <b>European Union Agenda for the Rights of the Child, 
15 February 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is one of the objectives of the EU on 
which the Treaty of Lisbon has put further emphasis. Notably, Article 3(3) of the Treaty on 
European Union today explicitly requires the EU to promote the protection of the rights of 
the child. The rights of the child are furthermore enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental 
Rights of the European Uniona. Article 24 of the Charter recognises that children are 
independent and autonomous holders of rights. It also makes the child's best interests a 
primary consideration for public authorities and private institutions. 
</p>
<p>Promoting the rights of the child is also a result of international commitments. All EU 
Member States ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC).b The standards and principles of the UNCRC must continue to guide EU 
policies and actions that have an impact on the rights of the child. In 2006, the Commission 
established a basis for promoting and protecting the rights of the child in its internal and 
external policies with its Communication &quot;Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the 
Child&quot;c. The Commission thereby set up structuresd to strengthen the capacity of EU 
institutions to address child rights issues, laying the foundations for evidence-based policies 
and stepping up interaction with stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>In view of the strong and reinforced commitment to the rights of the child in the Treaty of 
Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Commission believes it is now the 
time to move up a gear on the rights of the child and to transform policy objectives into 
action. The Europe 2020 Strategye sets out a vision for the 21st century of a Europe where 
the children of today will have a better education, access to the services and to the resources 
they need to grow up and, one day, lead Europe into the 22nd century. This is why the 
Commission, with this Communication, advocates &quot;An EU Agenda for the Rights of the 
Child&quot;. The purpose is to reaffirm the strong commitment of all EU institutions and of all 
Member States to promoting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of the child in all relevant 
EU policies and to turn it into concrete results. In the future, EU policies that directly or 
indirectly affect children should be designed, implemented, and monitored taking into 
account the principle of the best interests of the child enshrined in the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights and in the UNCRC. 
</p>
<p>This EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child is based on contributions from a wide public 
consultationf and on the needs and concerns that children from all EU Member States

preliminary results of an evaluation of the impact of EU instruments affecting the rights of t 
he child. The European Parliamenth, the Committee of the Regionsi, the Economic and 
Social Committee and the Council of Europej as well as key stakeholders such as UNICEF, 
the Ombudspersons for children in the Member States, and civil society have contributed to 
the preparation of this Communication including through the work of the European Forum 
on the Rights of the Childk. 
</p>
<p>The EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child presents general principles that should ensure 
that EU action is exemplary in ensuring the respect of the provisions of the Charter and of 
the UNCRC with regard to the rights of children. In addition, it focuses on a number of 
concrete actions in areas where the EU can bring real added value, such as child-friendly 
justice, protecting children in vulnerable situations and fighting violence against children 
both inside the European Union and externally. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. General Principles 
</b></p>
<p>The EU's commitment to the rights of the child requires a coherent approach across all 
relevant EU actions. This objective can be reached by using the Treaties, the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (UNCRC) as a common basis for all EU action, which is relevant to children. The 
&quot;child rights perspective&quot; must be taken into account in all EU measures affecting children. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.1. Making the rights of the child an integral part of the EU's fundamental rights policy 
</b></p>
<p>The Commission's Strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental 
Rights, adopted on 19 October 2010l, requires the Commission to ensure from an early 
stage, by means of a &quot;fundamental rights check&quot;, that its legislative proposals are always in 
full compliance with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter. In line with this 
Strategy, the Commission is working with the European Parliament and the Council to

policy areas.

<p>ensure that also amendments introduced during the legislative process are fully respecting 
the Charter. The Commission is also working with Member States that they comply with 
the Charter when implementing EU legislation into national law, as required by Article 
51(1) of the Charter. 
</p>
<p>The rights of the child, guaranteed by Article 24 of the Charter, are one of the fundamental 
rights mentioned explicitly in the Commission's Strategy. It is thus included in the regular 
&quot;fundamental rights check&quot; which the Commission applies to relevant draft EU legislation. 
</p>
<p>As announced in the Communication on the Strategy for the effective implementation of 
the Charter, the Commission has developed mechanisms to monitor the conformity of draft 
legislative actions with the Charter. In order to reinforce its assessment of the impact of its  
proposals on fundamental rights, including on the rights of the child, the Commission has 
prepared operational guidance that will enable its departments to examine the impact of an 
Initiative on fundamental rights, including the rights of the child, and to select the option 
that best takes into consideration the best interests of the child. This operational guidance 
covers the questions set out in the &quot;fundamental rights check-list&quot; announced in the 
Strategy for the effective implementation of the Charter. The Commission will also provide 
practical internal training on the rights of the child and other fundamental rights to reinforce 
and further promote a culture of respect for fundamental rights. The Commission will also 
continue to follow attentively the work of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
its interpretation of the provisions of the UNCRC. Where relevant, the explanatory 
memorandums of the relevant legislative proposals will explain how child rights 
considerations were taken into account in the drafting of proposals. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.2. Building the basis for evidence-based policy making 
</b></p>
<p>Experience with implementing the 2006 Communication has revealed a significant lack of 
reliable, comparable and official data. This is a serious obstacle for the development and 
implementation of genuine evidence-based policies. Improving the existing monitoring 
systems, establishing child rights-related policy targets, and monitoring their impact are one 
of the key challenges. Gaps in knowledge about the situation and needs of the most 
vulnerable groups of children should be addressed as a matter of priority. In this context, 
there is also a need for more information on methods to prevent crimes against children. 
</p>
<p>The Commission will cooperate with the relevant organisations and institutions to produce 
<b>basic data</b> and information to guide decision making. The process will take stock of 
existing work in this area, including the outcome of the study on indicators carried out by 
the EU fundamental Rights Agencym. These indicators were developed on the request of the 
Commission to measure how the rights of the child are implemented, protected, respected 
and promoted across the EU. They are intended to guide the Agency's data collection and 
research, allowing it to develop evidence-based opinions and support the EU institutions 
and Member States when they take measures or formulate actions. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.3. Cooperation with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>The Commission will continue to work together and maintain a dialogue with all 
stakeholders through the <b>European Forum for the Rights of the Child</b>, which meets 
regularly. 
</p>

</p>
<p>European Union, available at: http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/RightsofChild_summary-
report_en.pdf. </p>


<p>There are a variety of institutional and policy structures designed to protect and promote the 
rights of the child in Member States. While all EU Member States have recognised the need 
to develop policies in relation to the rights of the child, the institutional mechanisms for 
making and delivering policy in this area vary among them. In full respect of the principle 
of subsidiarity the Commission will continue to support Member States' efforts by 
promoting exchange of best practice, cooperation and communication with and among 
national authorities responsible for protecting and promoting the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Towards Concrete EU Action for Children 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2.1. Child-friendly justice 
</b></p>
<p>Making the justice system more child-friendly in Europe is a key action item under the EU 
Agenda for the Rights of the Child. It is an area of high practical relevance where the EU 
has, under the Treaties, competences to turn the rights of the child into reality by means of 
EU legislation. The Commission's Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programmen 
has therefore highlighted this aspect for the period 2010-2015. 
</p>
<p>Children may become involved with the justice systems in a number of ways, for example 
when their parents&#8216; divorce or disagree over custody, when they commit offences, when 
</p>
<p>they witness crimes or are their victims, or when they seek asylum. When children are 
involved with justice systems that are not child-friendly, they can be subject to manifold 
restrictions or violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>Children can face obstacles with regard to legal representation or being heard by judges. 
Likewise, the information, which is necessary for children and their representatives to 
exercise their rights or defend their interests in judicial proceedings can be inadequate. 
Children can be treated as adults without always being afforded specific safeguards in 
accordance with their needs and vulnerability, and may have difficulties coping with this 
situation. Effective access to justice and participation in administrative and court 
proceedings are basic requirements to ensure a high level of protection of children&#8216;s legal 
</p>
<p>interests. 
</p>
<p>Family law disputes may have adverse effects on the well-being of children. Children who 
are separated from one or both parents must be allowed to maintain personal relations and 
direct contacts with both of them on a regular basis, except where it is contrary to their best 
interests.o Civil proceedings, especially transnational litigation, deriving from dissolution of 
marriage or legal separation may result in a restriction of this right. Particularly during 
proceedings to determine parental responsibility, children can become hostage to long cross 
border legal disputes between the former partners. EU legislationp already facilitates the 
recognition and enforcement of decisions on parental responsibility. The adequate provision 
of information to children and parents about their rights under EU law and national law is a 
prerequisite to enable them to defend their rights in family law litigation. Information 
should be easily accessible and provide clear guidance on the relevant procedures. The 
Commission, in cooperation with Member States, will develop and keep updated factsheets 
on EU and national legislation on maintenance obligations, mediation and recognition and

<p>enforcement of decisions on parental responsibility. As regards parental child abduction, 
the Commission will pay particular attention to the information provided by the European 
Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abductions. 
</p>
<p>The registration and recognition of documents related to civil status are important for the 
determination of a child&#8216;s rights. When children and their parents move within the EU and 
need to use such documents in another Member State they often encounter costly and 
lengthy requirements for their recognition (involving translations and proof of authenticity), 
which may make access to justice difficult. This is why the Commission has launched a 
public consultation on ways to facilitate the mutual recognition across the EU of the effects 
of civil status documents with a view to proposing EU measures in 2013q. 
</p>
<p>The right to a fair trial for children who are subject to criminal proceedings implies the 
protection of privacy, the right to be informed about the charges and the proceedings in a 
way which is adapted to the child&#8216;s age and maturity, legal assistance and legal 
representation. This is especially important when the language of the proceedings is not the 
mother tongue of the child. In 2010, the EU adopted rules on interpretation and translation 
that ensure thatall persons, including children, receive information about their rights in the 
proceedings in a manner that they can understandr. The Commission will pursue its agenda 
aiming at strengthening the procedural rights of suspected or accused persons in criminal 
proceedings, including children. In 2011 the Commission will put forward a proposal 
containing rules to ensure access to a lawyer, and a proposal concerning the right for 
detainees to communicate with family members, trusted persons, employers and consular 
authorities. Special attention is due with regard to suspected or accused persons who cannot 
understand or follow the content or the meaning of the proceedings, owing, for example, to 
their age, mental or physical condition. In 2012 the Commission will table a legislative 
proposal on special safeguards for suspected or accused persons who are vulnerable. This 
measure will be of key importance to ensure child-friendly justice. 
</p>
<p>Children sentenced to custody and placed in criminal detention structures are particularly at

<p>Children often participate as vulnerable witnesses or victims in criminal judicial

<p><b>  Actions: 
</b></p>
<p>In the context of its civil and criminal justice policies, and in line with its Strategy on the 
effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Commission will 
contribute to making the justice systems in the EU more child-friendly, notably by: 
</p>
<p>1. Adopting, in 2011, a proposal for a Directive on victims&#8216; rights raising the level of 
protection of vulnerable victims, including children; 
</p>
<p>2. Tabling, in 2012, a proposal for a Directive on special safeguards for suspected or 
accused persons who are vulnerable, including children; 
</p>
<p>3. Revising, by 2013, the EU legislation facilitating the recognition and enforcement of 
decisions on parental responsibility with a view to ensuring, in the interest of the child, that 
decisions can be recognised and enforced as quickly as possible, including, where 
appropriate, the establishment of common minimum standards; 
</p>
<p>4. Promoting the use of the Council of Europe Guidelines of 17 November 2010 on 
child-friendly justicev and taking them into account in future legal instruments in the field 
of civil and criminal justice; 
</p>
<p>5. Supporting and encouraging the development of training activities for judges and 
other professionals at European level regarding the optimal participation of children in 
judicial systems. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.2. Targeting EU action to protect children when they are vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p>Some categories of children are particularly vulnerable and face greater risks to their lives 
and well-being due to social, political and economic factors. For example, children growing 
up in poverty and social exclusionw, often accompanied with drug abuse, are less likely to 
do well in school and enjoy good physical and mental healthx. They are also more likely to 
find themselves in conflict with the justice system. The needs of children at risk of poverty 
and social exclusion will be addressed in a Commission Recommendation on child poverty, 
which will outline common principles and propose effective monitoring tools to prevent 
and combat child poverty within the framework of the Platform against Poverty and Social 
Exclusion. 
</p>
<p><b>Disabled children</b> are also more vulnerable to the violation of their rights and they require 
and deserve special protectiony.

<p>The well-being of children can only be achieved in a society which is free of violence, 
abuse and exploitation of children. In March 2010, the Commission adopted two proposals 
for Directives aiming at reinforcing the framework for protection of some of most 
vulnerable children, those who are victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking. In the area 
of trafficking it is important that specific needs of children are fully taken into account in 
further development of trafficking policy notably within the integrated strategy on 
countering trafficking in human beings which will be adopted in 2012. 
</p>
<p>As regards detention for administrative purposes of children seeking asylum, the 
Commission has worked to take forward its 2008 and 2009 proposals amending EU asylum 
law. These proposals prohibit the detention of children unless it is in their best interest and 
only after all possible alternatives have been exhaustively assessed. A number of necessary 
safeguards and procedural guarantees are also introduced concerning access to a judicial 
review and legal representation. Finally, the proposals provide for a clear prohibition of the  
detention of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. 
</p>
<p>The Commission's 2010 Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minorsz puts forward a common 
EU approach towards unaccompanied or separated children coming from outside the EU. 
The Action Plan identifies child-specific reception measures and procedural guarantees that 
should apply from the moment the child is found until a durable solution is found. It also 
stresses the importance of appropriate representation of the child, proposes actions to 
address the shortcomings in the care provided to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children 
in the EUaa and to avoid the disappearance of unaccompanied children who are in the care 
of public authorities. 
</p>
<p>Experienced and well trained professionals can prevent problems and help children deal 
with the trauma they experience. Professionals working with and for children should 
receive adequate training on the rights and needs of children of different age groups, as well 
as on the type of proceedings that are adapted to them. They should also be trained in 
communicating with children of all ages and stages of development, as well as with 
children in situations of particular vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>In 2009, more than 6 million young people left education and training, completing lower 
secondary education or less; 17.4% of them completed only primary education. This is the 
reason why one of the headline targets agreed by the European Council in the framework of 
the Europe 2020 Strategy is to reduce the share of early school leavers to less than 10%. 
Giving all children access to early childhood education and care is the foundation for 
successful lifelong learning, social integration, personal development and later 
employability. The Commission has already identified specific policy actions and 
recommendations to tackle early school leavingbb. It will also promote initiatives in 
collaboration with Member States to encourage quality early childhood education and care, 
fight against segregation in educational systems, and disseminate good practices.

http://ec.europa.eu/education/school-education/doc/earlycom_en.pdf </p>


<p>The situation of Roma children in the EU is particularly worrying, due to a range of factors 
that may make them especially vulnerable and exposedcc to poor health, poor housing, poor 
nutrition, exclusion, discrimination and violencedd. Social exclusion of Roma children is 
often linked to lack of birth registration, low participation in early childhood and higher 
education, high school drop-out rates, trafficking and labour exploitation. Segregation is a 
crucial barrier preventing access to quality education for Roma children. 
</p>
<p>Children may go missing regardless of their age, gender or social status. There is little 
knowledge about the reasons why children run away from home or from institutions in 
which they live, but we do know that the risks are enormous: risks to their safety, mental 
and physical health, well-being and life. Missing children can suffer violence and abuse; 
they can be trafficked or exposed to begging and prostitution. 
</p>
<p>The Commission has identified a number of tools that can be of help in case a child is 
missing. For several years now, some Member Statesee have been introducing public alert 
systems in cases of child abduction or disappearances of children in circumstances which 
could pose a serious risk to the safety and well-being of the children concerned. The 
Commission will continue to promote cross-border cooperation between Member States in 
cases of criminal abductions of children through child alert mechanisms. In order to 
enhance cooperation in this field, the Member States agreed, in June 2009, on better use of 
the Schengen Information System, and the related SIRENE Bureaux based in each Member 
State, in the search for the missing children. The Commission will contribute to this process 
by adopting, by May 2011, a new version of the SIRENE Manual, within a Commission 
Decision. This will contain the set of rules and procedures for such cases. 
</p>
<p>The 116 000 hotline for missing children offers help, support and a potential lifeline for 
missing children and their parents. Because of the poor rate of implementation of the 
hotline at EU level, in 2010 the Commission adopted a Communicationff32 with the 
objective to encourage the Member States to implement the missing children hotline as a 
matter of priority and to ensure that the same high quality of service is offered throughout 
the Union. The Commission will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the 
hotline for missing children in all Member States. If no further progress is made within a 
reasonable timeframe, the Commission will consider presenting a legislative proposal to 
make sure that the 116 000 hotline is fully operational in all Member States. 
</p>
<p>Children can also be especially vulnerable in relation to modern technology. Online 
technologies bring unique opportunities to children and young people by providing access 
to knowledge and allowing them to benefit from digital learning and participate in the 
public debate. Children are particularly vulnerable when they are confronted with harmful 
content and conduct, such as cyber-bullying and grooming, in audiovisual media and on the 
Internet. Children across Europe testify that physical and emotional bullying in schools is

<p>part of their everyday livesgg. Cyber-bullying has been identified as a modern manifestation 
of bullying that calls for urgent responses and the involvement of all relevant actors, such 
as social networking sites, internet providers and the police. The Commission aims at 
achieving a high level of protection of children in the digital space, including of their 
personal datahh, while fully upholding their right to access internet for the benefit of their 
social and cultural development. Through the Safer Internet programmeii, the Commission 
coordinates and supports efforts to empower and protect children online. Various sectors of 
the Information and Communication Technologies industry have been engaged in self-
regulatory initiatives in particular to increase the protection of children using mobile phonejj 
and social networking serviceskk and through the Pan European Game Information rating 
system of video and online gamesll. The Commission will now expand its call for action to 
manufacturers of mobile devices and game consoles, internet service providers, mobile 
applications and content providers, consumer organisations, researchers and child welfare  
organisations. 
</p>
<p>The Commission is closely monitoring the transposition of the Audiovisual Media Services 
Directivemm  by the Member States into their national law, for which the deadline was 19 
December 2009. The Directive extends the standards for protection of children from 
traditional TV programmes to the fast growing on-demand audiovisual media services, 
particularly on the Internet.

<p><b>Actions: 
</b></p>
<p>The Commission will contribute to empowering and protecting children when they are 
vulnerable, notably by: 
</p>
<p>6. Supporting the exchange of best practices and the improvement of training for 
guardians, public authorities and other actors who are in close contact with unaccompanied 
children (2011-2014); 
</p>
<p>7. Paying particular attention to children in the context of the EU Framework for

<p><b> 2.3. Children in the EU's external action 
</b></p>
<p>The EU is determined to give priority to the promotion and protection of the rights of the 
child also in its external actionnn including in judicial cooperation in civil matters in areas of 
EU competence. In this respect, it is crucial for the EU to have a strong single voice in 
external matters when the rights of the child are concerned in relations with third countries 
to ensure swift and effective action where necessary. The EU&#8216;s external policy on the rights 
</p>
<p>of the child will be conducted in line with the 2008 Communication &#8213;A Special Place for<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Children in EU External Action&#8214; and the accompanying Action Plan. 
</p>
<p><b>The EU is strongly committed to eliminating all forms of violence against children</b>. 
Approximately 200 million children worldwide witness domestic violence annually, over 
200 million children worldwide are subject to sexual violence, over 50 000 children die as a 
result of homicide every year, and up to 2 million children are treated in hospitals for 
violence related injuries. The EU will continue the implementation of the EU Guidelines on 
the Rights of the Child, which currently focus on combating all forms of violence against 
children. By the end of 2011, the EU will evaluate the implementation of the Guidelines 
since 2007. The &quot;Investing in People&quot; thematic programme envisages funding for projects 
aimed at combating violence against children in the years 2011-2013. 
</p>
<p>More than 200 million children worldwide are still in child labour and a staggering 115 
million at least, are subject to its worst forms. The EU will continue its efforts to combat 
child labour, in line with the 2010 Commission Staff Working Document and Council 
conclusions on Child Labour. The EU will prepare by the end of 2011 a report on the worst 
forms of child labour and trade, taking into account international experience and the views 
of competent international organisations. In 2011, the EU will select projects targeting child 
labour in third countries under the &quot;Investing in People&quot; thematic programme. 
</p>
<p>Children in armed conflictsoo are particularly vulnerable, even more so when they have lost 
or have been separated from their parents or care-givers.  
</p>
<p>Children are exposed to risks of recruitment by armed groups, sexual abuse and 
exploitation or trafficking. They disproportionately suffer from malnourishment and illness 
as they are deprived from access to basic social services, health care and education. At any 
given time, an estimated 300 000 children are associated with armed forces and groups, 
among which 40% girls. The EU will continue its work on safeguarding rights of children 
in and affected by armed conflicts based on the concrete actions envisaged in the 2010 
Implementation Strategy of the EU Guidelines on Children in Armed Conflicts.

&quot;Children in Emergency and Crisis Situations&quot; (2008), the EU Guidelines on the Rights of the Child 
(2007), the EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflicts (2003, updated 2008), the Council

children and physically maimed 6 million more while some 20 million children are displaced or 
refugee and one million have become orphans due to conflicts. </p>


<p>travelling sex offenders face legal consequences in their respective home countries in the 
EU, action should be undertaken to increase the number of investigations and prosecutions 
within the EU for offences committed outside the EU. 
</p>
<p>The EU will continue to pursue a political dialogue with third countries and international 
organisations, in order to maintain or improve the respect and promotion of the rights of the 
child. As part of its enlargement policy, the EU will continue to promote the reform of child 
protection and will closely monitor progress on the rights of the child throughout the 
accession process in the candidate countries and potential candidates, especially as regards 
children of ethnic minorities and marginalised groups, such as Roma, which have been 
identified as particularly vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>Bilateral co-operation with third countries will be structured around measures such as 
scaling up development programmes focused on the rights of the child to, for instance, 
support stronger national structures and institutions, including the development of 
independent child rights institutions, promote legislative reforms in conformity with 
relevant international standards and promote the rights of the child through trade 
instruments and in international negotiations. 
</p>
<p>In multilateral cooperation the EU will continue its support for international initiatives, 
including tabling resolutions at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights 
Council. It will also intensify coordination with international stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>In humanitarian aid, the EU will continue and increase the support to projects and activities 
that directly target the specific needs of children in emergencies along the lines set in the 
2008 Staff Working Paper on &quot;Children in Situations of Emergency and Crisis&quot;.pp

<p><b> 3. Child Participation and Awereness Raising 
</b></p>
<p>The results of two Eurobarometer surveys of 2008 and 2009 showed that 76% of childrenss 
interviewed were not aware of having rights and 79 % did not know who to contact in case 
of need. When asked what action the EU should take to promote and protect the rights of 
the child, 88 % of respondents indicated that the EU should provide more information to 
children about their rights in an accessible way. 
</p>
<p>Full recognition of the rights of the child means that children must be given a chance to 
voice their opinions and participate in the making of decisions that affect them. Article 
24(1) of the Charter requires the EU to take children's views into considerations on matters 
which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity.

<p>Steps taken by the Commission so far to consult children and listen to themtt are a starting 
point in providing possibilities for greater participation of children in the development and 
implementation of actions and policies that affect them, such as for example education, 
health or environment policies. To this end, the Commission will draw on the expertise of 
the European Forum on the Rights of the Child and will continue to work with this Forum 
and with Ombudspersons for children and other relevant partners in this area. 
</p>
<p>To ensure better and more effective information of children about their rights and about 
relevant EU policies will require consolidation and modernisation of existing information 
tools. At present the information targeting children on the EU's web portal EUROPA can be 
found via Quick links for kidsuu and the Teachers' Cornervv. These links give access to 
material provided by all EU institutions which is relevant for children. Many of the material 
accessible from these web pages are also hosted on individual Commission Directorate 
Generals' or the websites of other EU institutions. However, comprehensive, consolidated 
and easily accessibly information on the rights of the child and EU policies relevant for 
children is currently missing. 
</p>
<p><b>  Action: 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Commission will set up, in the course of 2011, a single entry point on EUROPA 
with information for children on the EU and on the rights of the child. This single entry 
point will provide easy access to information that can be understood by children of different 
age groups and can be used by parents and teachers to find information and teaching 
materials. The Commission will invite other EU institutions to join this initiative<b>. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>With this EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child, the Commission calls on the EU 
institutions and on the Member States to renew their commitment to step up efforts in 
protecting and promoting the rights of children. The action of the EU should be exemplary 
in ensuring the respect of the provisions of the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights 
of the European Union and of the UNCRC with regard to the rights of children. The 
Commission will review regularly progress made in the implementation of the EU Agenda 
for the Rights of the Child in its Annual Report on the application of the Charter. 
</p>
<p>As underlined in the Europe 2020 Strategy, the long-term effects of not investing enough in 
policies affecting children may have a profound impact on our societies. Many of these 
policies require determined action by the Member States, and the Commission is ready to 
offer its support and cooperation. The Commission will continue to play its part in joint 
efforts to achieve well-being and safety of all children. A renewed commitment of all actors 
is necessary to bring to life the vision of a world where children can be children and can 
safely live, play, learn, develop their full potential, and make the most of all existing 
opportunities.
