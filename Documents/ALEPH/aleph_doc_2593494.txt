on or about August 12, 2016, to holders of common stock, par value $0.001 per 
share (&ldquo;<U>Common Stock</U>&rdquo;),
of Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the &ldquo;<U>Company</U>,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;<U>Lucas</U>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<U>we</U>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<U>us</U>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<U>our</U>&rdquo;). You are receiving this 
Information Statement in accordance with the requirements
of Section 14(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), and Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 14f-1, promulgated under the Exchange Act, in connection with an
anticipated change in majority control of the
Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors (the &ldquo;<U>Board</U>&rdquo; or the 
&ldquo;<U>Board of Directors</U>&rdquo;) other than by
a meeting of stockholders, through the appointment to the Company&rsquo;s Board 
of persons designated by the sellers (the &ldquo;<U>Sellers</U>&rdquo;)
of assets pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &ldquo;<U>Asset Purchase 
Agreement</U>&rdquo; we entered into in December
2015.</P>
<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 9pt 0 0; text-align:

the Asset Purchase Agreement, as purchaser, with twenty-one separate Sellers and
Segundo Resources, LLC, as a Seller and as the
Representative. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and subject to the 
terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire
from the Sellers (the &ldquo;<U>Acquisition</U>&rdquo;), working interests in 
producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Texas
and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage 
blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region of the
United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements 
associated therewith, as well as producing shale properties
in Glasscock County, Texas (the &ldquo;<U>Assets</U>&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 9pt 0 0; text-align:
justify">As consideration for the Acquisition,
we agreed to assume $31.35 million of commercial bank debt; issue 552,000 shares
of our amended and restated designated Series
B Preferred Stock (convertible into 3,941,280 shares of Common Stock) to one of 
the Sellers and its affiliate, which are under
common control with the Seller Representative, with a total liquidation value of
$13.8 million; issue 13,009,664 shares of Common
Stock to certain of the Sellers; and pay $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the 
Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, in the event
there are any title or other material issues associated with the Assets, the 
parties agreed to work in good faith to address such
issues, and if such issues cannot be addressed, to adjust the purchase price, 
provided that no adjustment will be made unless such
issues in aggregate total more than 5% of the aggregate purchase price, and 
provided further that if such issues in aggregate total
more than 20% of the aggregate purchase price, we can terminate the Asset 
Purchase Agreement, all of which are subject to the terms
of the Asset Purchase Agreement. We and the Sellers also agreed to a true-up for
certain joint interest billings and authorization
for expenditures at and/or after closing, and to effect a true-up in connection 
with any material agreements, if the rights thereto
are not provided by the Sellers at closing. We may pay fees and expenses 
attributable to the Sellers incurred prior to April 1,
2016 as long as those expenses do not exceed $960,000.</P>
<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 9pt 0 0; text-align:
justify">The Acquisition is subject to customary
conditions which must be satisfied or waived prior to the closing, including (1)
approval by our stockholders of the issuance
of the Acquisition Shares, (2) receipt by us of the $4.975 million required to 
be paid to the Sellers at closing, which we plan
to raise from the Sellers&rsquo; debt holders from whom we are required to 
assume the $31.35 million in debt; (3) receipt of required
regulatory approvals, (4) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the 
consummation of the Acquisition, and (5) approval by
the NYSE MKT of the continued listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE MKT prior 
to and following the closing. Each party&rsquo;s
obligation to complete the Acquisition is also subject to certain additional 
customary conditions, including (a) subject to certain
exceptions, the accuracy of the respective representations and warranties of the
other parties, and (b) performance in all material
respects by the other parties of their respective obligations under the Asset 
Purchase Agreement.</P>

changes planned at this time in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Asset Purchase Agreement, as Anthony C. Schnur
will maintain his role as our President and Chief Executive Officer following 
the closing. However, the Sellers will have the
right pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement to appoint three members to our 
Board, and it is anticipated that their director
nominees will be Richard N. Azar II, Alan Dreeben and Robert Tips. Mr. Azar is 
the principal Seller and manager of the properties
being acquired in the Acquisition, and is planned to be appointed as Executive 
Chairman of the Company following the closing of
the Acquisition. Mr. Azar is a founding partner of the Representative, and for 
over 20 years has been instrumental in developing
the Hunton resource play in Central Oklahoma through his direction of the 
Representative, ownership in Altex Resources, Inc.,
and various other successful oil and gas ventures. Mr. Azar will also be 
receiving a significant amount of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon closing of the Acquisition and all of the Series B Preferred
Stock issuable at closing, either personally
or through entities which he controls. Mr. Dreeben and his affiliate Azar-
Dreeben A&amp;D Fund, LP also are Sellers and Mr. Tips
is affiliated with another one of the Sellers, Azar, MPII &amp; Range A&amp;D 
Fund, LP, all of which will be receiving a significant
amount of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon closing of the Acquisition. 
By the sixth month anniversary of the closing of
the Acquisition, one of the three current members of our Board will be required 
to resign in order that we will have five members
of our Board, including three appointed by the Sellers, on such date.</P>

affect its choice of structure.</P>

proposal, voted in favor of our Named Executive
Officers&rsquo; 2013 compensation. The Board and the Compensation Committee 
considered these favorable results and did not make
significant changes to our executive compensation program because it believes 
this advisory shareowner vote indicates strong support
for our current compensation policies. Additionally, at the annual meeting, 
stockholders holding 27.0% of the total shares eligible
to be voted at the annual meeting, 32.1% of the shares voted at the annual 
meeting and 64.6% of the total votes cast on the proposal
voted in favor of holding future advisory votes on executive compensation of our
named executive officers every three years. In
light of the voting results with respect to the frequency of holding a non-
binding, advisory vote on executive compensation, and
consistent with the fact that such period received the highest number of votes 
cast at the meeting, the Board of Directors has
determined that the Company will hold future non-binding, advisory votes of 
stockholders to approve the compensation of the named
executive officers every three years until the next non-binding, advisory 
stockholder vote on the frequency of stockholder votes
on executive compensation, scheduled to occur at our 2017 annual meeting of

1, 2012, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Schnur to 
serve as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company,
which agreement was amended and restated effective December 12, 2012, in 
connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.
The agreement has a term of two years, expiring on October 31, 2014, provided 
that the agreement is automatically extended for
additional one year terms, unless either party provides notice of their intent 
not to renew within the 30 day period prior to any
automatic renewal date, and as neither party provided notice of their intent to 
terminate in fiscal 2015, the agreement automatically
extended for an additional one year term until October 31, 2016. The Company 
agreed to pay Mr. Schnur a base annual salary of $310,000
during the term of the agreement, of which $290,000 is payable in cash and 
$20,000 is payable in shares of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock. The stock consideration due under the agreement is payable in 
quarterly installments at the end of each quarter,
based on the stock price on the last day of each quarter. Mr. Schnur is also 
eligible for an annual bonus of up to 30% of his base
salary in cash or stock.</P>

by the Company for a reason other than cause (as described in the Employment 
Agreement) or by Mr. Schnur for good reason (as described
in the Employment Agreement), Mr. Schnur is due in the form of a lump sum 
payment, the product of the base salary and bonus he
was paid under the agreement for the prior 12 month period, provided that if 
such termination occurs six months before or 24 months
following the occurrence of a Change of Control (as described in the Employment 
Agreement), Mr. Schnur is due 200% of the amount
described above upon such termination. If Mr. Schnur&rsquo;s employment is 
terminated as a result of death or Disability (as defined
in the agreement), the Company will pay his base salary which would have been 
payable to Mr. Schnur through the date his employment
is terminated and all amounts actually earned, accrued or owing as of the date 
of termination. If Mr. Schnur&rsquo;s employment
is terminated for Cause or Mr. Schnur voluntarily terminates his employment, the
Company will pay his base salary and all amounts
actually earned, accrued or owing as of the date of termination and he will be 
entitled for a period of three months after termination
to exercise all options granted to him under his employment agreement or 
otherwise to the extent vested and exercisable on the
date of termination. Mr. Schnur&rsquo;s employment agreement contains no 
covenant-not-to-compete or similar restrictions after
termination. Additionally, any and all unvested options are forfeited upon the 
termination of the Employment Agreement.</P>

(&ldquo;<U>Allied</U>&rdquo;), entered into a Subscription Agreement with the 
Company and agreed to purchase 45,546 shares of restricted
common stock (the &ldquo;<U>Allied Shares</U>&rdquo;), which shares were held in
the Company&rsquo;s treasury, for $2.30 per share
(a 17% discount to the $2.78 closing price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock 
on September 17, 2015) or $104,754 in aggregate.
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement was 
subject to, and contingent upon, the approval of
the additional listing of the Allied Shares on the NYSE MKT (the 
&ldquo;<U>Listing Approval</U>&rdquo;). The Listing Approval was
received on September 21, 2015, and on such date the Subscription Agreement 
became binding on the parties. The Company received
funds from Allied on September 25, 2015, and issued Allied the Allied Shares on 
September 28, 2015. The principal of Allied is
John Chambers, who is also the principal of Silver Star. Because the Allied 
shares were issued from the Company&rsquo;s treasury,
the sale did not result in an increase in the Company&rsquo;s total issued 
shares.</P>

a first amendment to the August 30, 2015, Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement
with Silver Star Oil Company. Pursuant to the
first amendment to the line of credit, the line of credit was amended to add a 
9.99% ownership limitation and prevent the holder
of the convertible notes from converting such convertible notes into common 
stock of the Company if upon such conversion, the holder
would beneficially own more than 9.99% of our then outstanding common stock, 
subject to the ability of any holder to modify such

2, 2016, we provided Silver Star the required thirty days&rsquo; notice to
prepay the outstanding convertible notes, provided that
we did not have the funds necessary to prepay such notes, and such pre-payment 
notice expired. Additionally, pursuant to the agreement,
we and Silver Star agreed to amend the line of credit to remove the requirement 
that Silver Star consent to the Company making
distributions on its common stock, repurchasing common stock or making certain 
advances. Finally, Silver Star agreed that if Silver
Star did not advance the balance remaining under the line of credit ($1.4 
million) by February 19, 2016, the terms of the convertible
notes which require us to provide thirty days prior written notice before 
prepayment would be removed from the convertible notes
and such convertible notes could be repaid at any time, which funds were not 
advanced by such date. Silver Star also agreed to
waive the requirement that the Company obtain its prior written consent to 
undertake certain corporate actions, including designating
preferred stock, issuing securities totaling more than 10% of the 
Company&rsquo;s outstanding common stock, and effecting stock
splits, as originally required pursuant to the terms of the line of credit.</P>

Additionally, Silver Star provided us a release from any liability in connection

thereunder), unless the parties mutually agree to provide
for loans of up to $2.4 million (provided that $1 million has already been 
borrowed under such Line of Credit to date); (b) increased
the monthly advance limit under the Line of Credit from $200,000 to $250,000 per
month; (c) increased the conversion price of any
future notes issued under the Line of Credit to $3.25 per share (previously the 
conversion price was $1.50 per share, provided
that the conversion price of the February Note remained at $1.50 per share); (d)
amended the requirements for us to seek stockholder
approval of the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the notes 
to require us to seek stockholder approval at the
same time as we seek stockholder approval for the shares issuable pursuant to 
the terms of our December 2015 Asset Purchase Agreement;
