<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The General Assembly, in resolution 59/113A, proclaimed the World Programme 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights Education as a global initiative to advance the implementation of human 
</p>
<p>rights education in all sectors. The programme is structured in consecutive phases during 
</p>
<p>which different sectors are selected for particular national attention. The first phase covered 
</p>
<p>the period 2005 to 2009 and focused on integrating human rights education in primary and 
</p>
<p>secondary schools. An evaluation of that first phase was conducted in 2010 and is available 
</p>
<p>in document A/65/322. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in resolution 12/4, decided that the second phase of the 
</p>
<p>programme, covering the period 2010 to 2014, would focus on human rights education in 
</p>
<p>higher education and on human rights training for teachers and educators, civil servants, 
</p>
<p>law enforcement officials and military personnel at all levels. A plan of action to that end 
</p>
<p>was adopted by the Council in September 2010. The plan provided that, in early 2015, at 
</p>
<p>the conclusion of the second phase, each country would undertake an evaluation of actions 
</p>
<p>carried out and submit a national evaluation report to the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which would prepare a global evaluation 
</p>
<p>report to be submitted to the Council in 2015. 
</p>
<p>3. As requested by the Council in resolution 15/11, in 2012, OHCHR prepared a 
</p>
<p>progress report (see A/HRC/21/20) containing a preliminary overview of national human 
</p>
<p>rights education initiatives in higher education and in training for teachers and educators, 
</p>
<p>civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military, as reported by 34 Governments 
</p>
<p>and 14 national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>4. In September 2014, the Council reminded States, in resolution 27/12, to prepare and 
</p>
<p>submit their national evaluation reports on the second phase of the World Programme to 
</p>
<p>OHCHR by April 2015, in line with the plan of action. The Council also requested OHCHR 
</p>
<p>to submit to it at its thirtieth session an evaluation report on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>second phase of the World Programme, based on the national evaluation reports. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology  
</b></p>
<p>5. In February 2015, OHCHR sent notes verbales to States recalling the Council&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>reminder to submit their national evaluation reports on the second phase of the programme, 
</p>
<p>together with a guidance note, drawn from the plan of action, to facilitate their preparation. 
</p>
<p>6. By 1 June 2015, 28 Governments had responded (see annex). Their responses were 
</p>
<p>the primary source of information for this report, supplemented by the information 
</p>
<p>contained in the aforementioned 2012 progress report, as well as material received from 
</p>
<p>States in the context of the consultation that took place on the target sectors, focus areas or 
</p>
<p>thematic human rights issues for the third phase of the World Programme (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/24/24) and on the text of the plan of action for the third phase (see A/HRC/27/28). 
</p>
<p>In addition, information in the national reports submitted by States in the context of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review was also taken into account, where they highlighted pertinent 
</p>
<p>human rights education activities undertaken during 2010 to 2014. 
</p>
<p>7. Due to word-limit constraints, all the information that was submitted or reviewed 
</p>
<p>could not be included in the present report. Rather, based on the information available, the 
</p>
<p>report provides an overview of actions undertaken by Governments during the second </p>


<p>phase of the programme, drawing out some general points, highlighting specific examples 
</p>
<p>and presenting some of the challenges reported. Finally, the report offers conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations for further implementation of the World Programme. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of action at the national level  
</b></p>
<p>8. The responses received from States varied considerably in their approach. The 
</p>
<p>agencies charged with submitting the responses, which were not always clearly indicated, 
</p>
<p>also varied. In nine cases, a designated human rights ministry or department gathered 
</p>
<p>responses from the different government organs involved in implementing the programme. 
</p>
<p>In Colombia, for example, the Presidential Council for Human Rights and International 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Law assembled the responses from the Ministries of Internal Affairs, 
</p>
<p>Education and Defence, as well as from the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the Administrative 
</p>
<p>Department of the Civil Service and the Presidential Advisory on Human Rights. In 
</p>
<p>Honduras, the Directorate of Human Rights, Education and Peace oversaw the evaluation 
</p>
<p>and reporting process. In seven States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assumed 
</p>
<p>responsibility for preparing the response; and in five States, it was the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education. The Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Chile 
</p>
<p>gathered information from the Ministry of Education and other ministries, the judiciary, the 
</p>
<p>legislature and the National Institute for Human Rights, an autonomous public institution 
</p>
<p>that promotes human rights among civil servants, law enforcement officials and the armed 
</p>
<p>forces and at all levels of the education system.  
</p>
<p>9. It seems that not many States were able to tackle the evaluation comprehensively in 
</p>
<p>line with the guidance note transmitted by OHCHR. The reasons for this appeared to be 
</p>
<p>primarily lack of time and/or adequate resources. Some States limited their response to a 
</p>
<p>report on training courses provided or planned for one or two of the groups targeted in the 
</p>
<p>second phase: for example, higher education institutions in Estonia, or training courses to 
</p>
<p>staff of the Ministries of the Interior and Foreign Affairs in Kuwait. Burundi reported on 
</p>
<p>the training provided to police officials, school principals and a number of other key figures 
</p>
<p>across the country, while regretting that a lack of resources prevented it from doing more. 
</p>
<p>The response from Bosnia and Herzegovina was prepared by the Ministry of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and Refugees, which, in 2012, had organized a national workshop for relevant government 
</p>
<p>officials on the country&#8217;s obligations under Human Rights Council resolution 15/11. It 
</p>
<p>pointed out, with regret, that while it could report on a number of activities that had been 
</p>
<p>carried out, it had not been able to follow through the recommendations in full, owing to 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate technical support. Reporting on its progress under the World Programme, 
</p>
<p>Armenia considered the first and second phases incomplete and wished for them to be 
</p>
<p>retained for the third phase of the programme, which they considered should be extended to 
</p>
<p>10 years.  
</p>
<p>10. Notwithstanding the variety in the responses, it was possible to draw from them and 
</p>
<p>from other material reviewed a general overview of the initiatives in each of the focus 
</p>
<p>sectors of the second phase. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights education in higher education 
</b></p>
<p>11. A fFew States referred to higher education policies relating to human rights 
</p>
<p>education. A number of States stated that higher education establishments were 
</p>
<p>independent of the Government and could define their own programmes and policies 
</p>
<p>without interference from the State. In Hungary, the role of the State is to ensure that 
</p>
<p>freedom. At the same time, many States presented abundant evidence to show that human 
</p>
<p>rights were currently taught in many universities and other higher educational institutions </p>


<p>worldwide and that that was encouraged in a variety of ways. Recent national reports 
</p>
<p>submitted under the universal periodic review further attested to that. A survey carried out 
</p>
<p>in Chile found that 48.2 per cent of higher education institutions in that country included 
</p>
<p>the development of human rights as a subject in their strategic corporate plans and 63.5 per 
</p>
<p>cent included human rights as a specific subject in the curriculum. Colombia reported that, 
</p>
<p>while the majority of institutions of higher education in the country still regarded human 
</p>
<p>rights as a marginal aspect of the curriculum, the 2010&#8211;2014 National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Education Plan encouraged initiatives in that regard and considered that the impact of 
</p>
<p>human rights education within the informal education sector was beginning to exert a 
</p>
<p>positive influence on the formal education sector, also. In Mexico, the National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Programme 2014&#8211;2018 was contributing to the implementation of the 2011 
</p>
<p>constitutional human rights reform; in that context, a specific agreement had been 
</p>
<p>concluded between the Ministry of the Interior, the National Association of Universities 
</p>
<p>and Institutions of Higher Education and the National Human Rights Commission to further 
</p>
<p>the promotion of human rights in higher education. The 2012 progress report on the World 
</p>
<p>Programme (see A/HRC/21/20, para. 20) also indicated the substantial contribution of 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and other actors in that respect.  
</p>
<p>12. Human rights were currently addressed as a core element in the Faculties or 
</p>
<p>Departments of Law, Political Science, Social Science and/or International Relations in 
</p>
<p>universities in most of the reporting States, at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as 
</p>
<p>well as in general humanities and socioeconomic courses. Human rights were also taught as 
</p>
<p>necessary skills in psychology, mental health, medicine, communications, physics, 
</p>
<p>sustainable development courses, among others. In 2012, 534 universities in Japan offered 
</p>
<p>courses on human rights. The opportunities in Switzerland are manifold, with human rights 
</p>
<p>being taught in over 35 universities and institutes of higher learning. Whereas Togo 
</p>
<p>reported that it had not been able to do a great deal in resourcing human rights courses in 
</p>
<p>higher education, the subject was taught in the Faculties of Law and Political Science in the 
</p>
<p>national public universities of Lom&#233; and Kara and grants were awarded to Togolese 
</p>
<p>students to pursue master&#8217;s degrees in human rights in Benin and in France. The Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights in Guinea has a plan of action for the introduction of human rights 
</p>
<p>education in Guinea, including at the university level; in 2012, a master&#8217;s degree in human 
</p>
<p>rights and international humanitarian law was created at the University of Sonfonya, 
</p>
<p>supported by both Guinean and foreign professors. The first cohort of students graduated in 
</p>
<p>April 2014 and the university was currently developing human rights research programmes. 
</p>
<p>In Lebanon, the Academic University for Non-Violence and Human Rights, accredited in 
</p>
<p>2014 by the Council of Ministers, delivered master&#8217;s courses for students in the region.  
</p>
<p>13. While universities were the focus of most responses, human rights were also taught 
</p>
<p>in a range of other higher education establishments, including, for example, technical 
</p>
<p>higher education institutions in Romania and the Education Workers&#8217; Academy for 
</p>
<p>Training and Continuous Development in the Russian Federation. China noted in its last 
</p>
<p>report under the universal periodic review that the construction of a new series of national 
</p>
<p>human rights education and training centres had entered the substantive assessment phase. 
</p>
<p>14. A number of States (for example, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, 
</p>
<p>Hungary and Japan) mentioned that the laws relating to higher education contained human 
</p>
<p>rights provisions, especially insofar as they prohibited discrimination with regard to both 
</p>
<p>teaching staff and students. In Germany, higher education institutions were committed, by 
</p>
<p>law, to human rights and to ensuring the freedom of teaching, learning and research within 
</p>
<p>a framework based on democratic principles. Some States, such as Greece and Hungary,  
</p>
<p>referred to frameworks in place for admission to universities and other places of higher 
</p>
<p>education for members of particular minorities and for the education of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, including vocational training and lifelong learning. In Mexico, 11 Government-
</p>
<p>funded intercultural universities provided higher education for indigenous and other youth, </p>


<p>facilitated the preservation of indigenous cultures and supported the development of 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>15. Teaching methods were described as participatory in nature and little reference was 
</p>
<p>made to formal courses of lectures without active engagement on the part of students. 
</p>
<p>Honduras described how inter-institutional groups were formed to design and implement 
</p>
<p>programmes, including the curriculum framework, methodology, approach, evaluation and 
</p>
<p>profile of participants, with course modules developed by national and international 
</p>
<p>experts. 
</p>
<p>16. Turkey reported that 31 universities had graduate degree programmes and research 
</p>
<p>and application centres that conducted studies aimed at improving respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Human Rights Centre at the University of Sarajevo played 
</p>
<p>a key role in providing documentation, issuing publications, teaching, expert advice, 
</p>
<p>research and reporting on human rights. Switzerland and the Russian Federation, among 
</p>
<p>others, had international master&#8217;s degree programmes in human rights, supported by inter-
</p>
<p>institutional resource centres. A variety of specialized master&#8217;s courses were offered in a 
</p>
<p>number of universities, for example, on women and migration (Morocco) and on child 
</p>
<p>rights in public policy development (Honduras). Algeria, Germany and Morocco referred to 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization network of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Chairs in universities, which helps to promote programmes of this kind. 
</p>
<p>17. It was clear from the responses that many universities currently provided a rich 
</p>
<p>resource for teaching not only their regular students, but others as well. In Switzerland, the 
</p>
<p>Swiss Centre of Expertise in Human Rights, a network of universities supported by the 
</p>
<p>Federal Government, functions as a service centre on issues relating to migration, police 
</p>
<p>and justice, gender and other aspects of human rights. It offers human rights training and 
</p>
<p>produces pedagogical tools for various groups, including the authorities. The Faculty of 
</p>
<p>Political Science of the University of Belgrade is one example of a higher education 
</p>
<p>institution offering specialist studies for State employees (see section B below). 
</p>
<p>18. Several States (including the Bahamas, Hungary, Seychelles, Slovenia and 
</p>
<p>Switzerland) reported that human rights currently constituted a basic element in teacher 
</p>
<p>training, both prior to qualification and in service. In Sweden, the Education Act and the 
</p>
<p>national curriculum stipulate that everyone working in schools is obliged to promote 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights. In Togo, human rights training is necessary to obtain a 
</p>
<p>professional qualification to teach in all schools, however, such training is not mandatory 
</p>
<p>for promotion. In Slovenia, candidates for school principal must have attended courses on 
</p>
<p>human rights, while in the Republic of Korea, human rights are included in the training 
</p>
<p>required to qualify as head teacher, deputy head and teacher. Japan includes human rights 
</p>
<p>in the training of librarians. Honduras reported that, in 2013, it had launched a course aimed 
</p>
<p>at helping teachers to detect human rights violations in the educational context, to identify 
</p>
<p>those in situations of vulnerability and to apply appropriate methodologies to teach human 
</p>
<p>rights in the public education system. Since 2012, Georgia has paid special attention to the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with special education needs and persons with disabilities in programmes 
</p>
<p>for teachers and staff engaged in vocational training.  
</p>
<p>19. Insofar as in-service teacher training is concerned, Bosnia and Herzegovina noted 
</p>
<p>that the European Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the member states of the Council of Europe, obliged States to train all 
</p>
<p>educational workers in teaching and educating for democratic citizenship and human rights 
</p>
<p>so that they acquire thorough knowledge and understanding of the matter and the use of 
</p>
<p>appropriate teaching and learning methods. In Estonia, human rights are a priority in in-
</p>
<p>service teacher training. In the Republic of Moldova, distance-learning courses for teachers 
</p>
<p>were being developed on a number of issues. In Guinea, several teachers had enrolled in the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s only human rights master&#8217;s programme (at University of Sonfonya), although it </p>


<p>was not mandatory for advancement. Jordan reported on its five-year plan for teachers, 
</p>
<p>supervisors and school principals to participate in workshops on human rights concepts, the 
</p>
<p>preparation of learning activities for curricula specialists and textbook writers, while noting 
</p>
<p>that it still lacked the resources necessary to carry out the plan. Special attention is paid to 
</p>
<p>specific human rights issues during in-service training, as relevant in the particular national 
</p>
<p>context, including gender, equality and child rights (Republic of Moldova, Sudan, Italy); 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence (Botswana); anti-gypsyism (Germany); female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation (Gambia); and trafficking in persons (Ukraine). 
</p>
<p>20. There appeared to be a variety of opportunities for cooperation with other 
</p>
<p>Governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 
</p>
<p>human rights training initiatives for teachers. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported on its work 
</p>
<p>with the NGO, Civitas, to train some 30,000 teachers across the country, develop new 
</p>
<p>curricula and publish a university textbook on democracy and human rights. Georgia 
</p>
<p>reported earlier on similar work, in cooperation with the United States Agency for 
</p>
<p>International Development and other partners. Honduras had developed a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>plan, with support from the European Union, the United Nations Children&#8217;s  Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF) and others, with human resources from a range of national actors, including the 
</p>
<p>Honduras Autonomous University and the State Secretariat in the Education Office. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights training for civil servants 
</b></p>
<p>21. Human rights is a core element in mandatory training for civil servants in a number 
</p>
<p>of reporting States, including for new recruits (for example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
</p>
<p>Turkey), civil servants at all levels (for example, in Colombia, Germany and Sweden) and 
</p>
<p>top managers in public administration (for example, in Slovenia). Although not mandatory, 
</p>
<p>human rights are a priority area for the training of civil servants in Romania. Under the 
</p>
<p>Swiss Constitution, anyone working for the State is obliged to contribute to the protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights. In 2010&#8211;2011, in drawing up guidelines for the education and training of 
</p>
<p>civil servants, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security of the Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>included human rights in the mandatory training for civil servants. Australia established a 
</p>
<p>human rights public- sector education programme to strengthen capacity for developing 
</p>
<p>policies, programmes and legislation consistent with human rights and to guide 
</p>
<p>administrative decision-makers on human rights issues. Andorra set up human rights 
</p>
<p>training courses for public servants in line with the World Programme. In China, the 
</p>
<p>Central Party School and education units at all levels have universally incorporated human 
</p>
<p>rights in their curricula and conduct human rights education for leading officials of all 
</p>
<p>ranks. 
</p>
<p>22. The States indicated that human rights training was being extended to staff and 
</p>
<p>officials in many different agencies of central and local government, including the 
</p>
<p>Departments of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice and Education as well as 
</p>
<p>sociocultural advisers, family centre coordinators and education directors in communes, in 
</p>
<p>Burundi, and staff of the State Secretariats for Agriculture and Farming, Forestry 
</p>
<p>Conservation and Public Works, Transport and Housing, in Honduras. In Mexico, 
</p>
<p>thousands of civil servants at the federal and local levels have been trained on the contents 
</p>
<p>and scope of the 2011 constitutional human rights reform. While there is no 
</p>
<p>institutionalized human rights training for civil servants in Guinea, seminars and workshops 
</p>
<p>are organized for regional governors, prefects, teachers and mayors in specific contexts, for 
</p>
<p>example, elections, national reconciliation and transitional justice programmes and local 
</p>
<p>development. Guinea further identified the need for action plans for human rights training, 
</p>
<p>in particular for civil servants working in the areas of health, finance, land administration 
</p>
<p>and decentralization. In its latest report under the universal periodic review, the Lao 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Democratic Republic highlighted its efforts to build human rights capacity among </p>


<p>its government officials at both the central and local levels, and regretted that it had not 
</p>
<p>been able to cover the whole country due to lack of capacity. 
</p>
<p>23. Specific human rights of particular concern in the national and local contexts were 
</p>
<p>mentioned regularly in relation to in-service training for civil servants, often with regard to 
</p>
<p>groups in situations of vulnerability. Colombia reported on the Human Rights Training Plan 
</p>
<p>for public officials in the different territorial entities (governors&#8217; and mayors&#8217; offices) who 
</p>
<p>work with groups with special constitutional protection, including persons of African 
</p>
<p>descent, indigenous peoples, Roma and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered 
</p>
<p>communities. Greece mentioned initiatives undertaken specifically in relation to trafficking, 
</p>
<p>violence against women, racism and xenophobia. Greece has a permanent committee for 
</p>
<p>training on issues of gender equality and, in recent years, the Ministry of the Interior 
</p>
<p>Directorate of Migration Policy has conducted a special intercultural training programme 
</p>
<p>for civil servants dealing with third-country nationals. Romania highlighted integration of 
</p>
<p>minorities, social assistance and combating discrimination as priority areas for attention. 
</p>
<p>Switzerland&#8217;s Fight against Racism Service has trained several hundred public 
</p>
<p>administration officers on combating racial discrimination. The Czech Republic provides 
</p>
<p>training on trafficking to staff of social welfare departments of local authorities and 
</p>
<p>employment centres. Guatemala provides training on gender-based violence and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination for public servants in the regions. In Morocco, the staff of the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Youth and Sports, in particular those working in child-protection centres, completed a 
</p>
<p>series of human rights training courses, while public sector employees in Qatar receive 
</p>
<p>training in the protection of women and children. Germany reported that particular attention 
</p>
<p>was being paid to the use of personal data in computer science courses for public servants. 
</p>
<p>24. A range of learning methods exist for civil servants already in posts. Like Serbia and 
</p>
<p>Switzerland (see section A above), Croatia has included human rights training courses in 
</p>
<p>specialized university curricula for public and civil servants. In Germany, human rights 
</p>
<p>form part of the teaching and learning content of the in-service distance-learning 
</p>
<p>programme leading to a master&#8217;s degree in public administration. In the context of its 
</p>
<p>National Programme on Justice, Human Rights and Peace Culture, Honduras developed a 
</p>
<p>virtual learning platform and launched the first virtual course on human rights for public 
</p>
<p>servants. It reported that, in every branch of Government, the number of civil servants 
</p>
<p>trained in human rights was growing each year. In Chile training in human rights and 
</p>
<p>related matters is carried out  via the civil service computer training system, while in 
</p>
<p>Australia, a human rights e-learning module was being developed for 200,000 public 
</p>
<p>servants throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>25. A broad range of agencies are involved in conducting human rights training of civil 
</p>
<p>servants in the different States. In Japan, the National Personnel Authority established the 
</p>
<p>curriculum and the Ministry of Justice carries out workshops for central government 
</p>
<p>officers twice a year. The Local Autonomy College gives lectures on human rights for those 
</p>
<p>seeking senior positions in local public entities. The Ministry of Justice also trains leaders 
</p>
<p>on promoting human rights in prefectures and municipalities. In Switzerland, the Swiss 
</p>
<p>Centre of Expertise in Human Rights provides training for a diverse range of professionals, 
</p>
<p>including the authorities. In Colombia, the Office of the Ombudsman and the regional 
</p>
<p>ombudsman offices throughout the country promote human rights among public servants. 
</p>
<p>One of the roles of the Presidential Human Rights Commission in Guatemala is to promote 
</p>
<p>human rights in the training of civil servants. Since 2010, the Irish Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission has led a comprehensive human rights education and training project for the 
</p>
<p>Irish civil and public service which included both training activities and material 
</p>
<p>development. The Royal Institute of Territorial Administration of Morocco organized the 
</p>
<p>training of local authorities by judges, and invited the mediator and the National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council to share their expertise. In Romania, the National Agency of Civil Servants 
</p>
<p>develops professional training programmes for public administration personnel, while in the </p>


<p>United States of America, federal officials conduct targeted training sessions on human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties for state and local officials. 
</p>
<p>26. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs in a number of States provide human rights 
</p>
<p>training to diplomats and civilian experts departing on international missions (for example, 
</p>
<p>Japan), as well as to other Government employees (for example, Switzerland). Human 
</p>
<p>rights training is also mandatory for joining the diplomatic corps in some States (for 
</p>
<p>example, Paraguay). 
</p>
<p>27. The many possible synergies between institutions within each State to assure human 
</p>
<p>rights training for public servants has already been mentioned. Partnerships with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, regional organizations and NGOs as well as bilateral cooperation are also 
</p>
<p>important avenues for human rights education and training. In Honduras, for example, the 
</p>
<p>Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development provided essential support 
</p>
<p>for the needs assessment carried out in the sector, in 2012, and for the drawing up the 
</p>
<p>National Programme of Justice, Human Rights and Peace Culture, which constituted the 
</p>
<p>basis for all other plans and programmes. In Greece, the training of officials of the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction benefitted from the knowledge and 
</p>
<p>expertise of other European countries in the context of the European Integration Fund. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights training for law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>28. The basic training curriculum for cadets in police academies, colleges and agencies 
</p>
<p>in many States now includes human rights as a subject (Algeria, Australia, Belize, Bosnia 
</p>
<p>and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, France, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Greece, Italy, Japan, Mauritius, Monaco, Morocco, Republic of Korea, Romania, Serbia, 
</p>
<p>Slovenia, Sudan, Turkey and United Arab Emirates, to mention a few). In Colombia, a 
</p>
<p>1993 law made international human rights and international humanitarian law training a 
</p>
<p>policy for the National Police, stipulating that human rights must be included in all courses, 
</p>
<p>taking into account the importance of civil servants&#8217; responsibility for enforcing the law 
</p>
<p>and protecting citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms. Guinea is developing new modules for basic 
</p>
<p>human rights training. While a lack of resources means that the Ministry of Security is not 
</p>
<p>yet able to provide such training to all police units, it is already obligatory for civil 
</p>
<p>protection units. In Slovenia, programmes and policies relating to the organization and 
</p>
<p>work of the police must, by law, include the protection of human rights. Colombia 
</p>
<p>mentioned that human rights were being mainstreamed into different policing procedures. 
</p>
<p>29. In a number of States, in-service training in human rights is necessary for promotion 
</p>
<p>(for example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Japan, Qatar and Romania), while in 
</p>
<p>others, incentives, including remuneration, are given for such training (for example, in 
</p>
<p>Slovenia). Several States referred to the updated training that police received on particularly 
</p>
<p>pertinent issues and based on their respective levels. Continuous training, in particular for 
</p>
<p>those deployed on United Nations and European Union missions, was mentioned by a 
</p>
<p>number of States (for example, Romania and Slovenia). 
</p>
<p>30. The need for police human rights training to be practical was repeatedly stressed 
</p>
<p>and, as Chile, Greece, Japan and Lithuania, in particular, reported, oriented towards issues 
</p>
<p>that police officers could expect to encounter in their daily work. In that context, Morocco 
</p>
<p>mentioned on-site visits to exchange experiences and on-going evaluation through outreach 
</p>
<p>meetings. In Georgia, the Police Academy devotes special attention to teaching the legal 
</p>
<p>basis for the use of force and to the acquisition of the relevant practical skills by future 
</p>
<p>police officers, and every police officer has to undergo updated training periodically. In 
</p>
<p>Japan, training sessions are held at police headquarters, police stations and other 
</p>
<p>workplaces, as well as in police schools. In Germany, training is based on actual cases and 
</p>
<p>concrete measures are discussed in the context of practical situations. In Poland, the police </p>


<p>recruitment system has been revised to allow for candidates&#8217; interactions with other persons 
</p>
<p>to be examined thoroughly. 
</p>
<p>31. The Nepal police have central human rights units and human rights cells at the 
</p>
<p>regional and local levels as well as mechanisms to examine petitions against police 
</p>
<p>personnel for human rights violations, with the possibility of the results of such 
</p>
<p>examinations being published. In Lithuania and Qatar, outstanding performance is 
</p>
<p>rewarded and may be taken up for use as a case study in future training activities. A number 
</p>
<p>of awards, such as the &#8220;good conduct certificate&#8221;, have likewise been created in the United 
</p>
<p>Arab Emirates to nurture motivation.  
</p>
<p>32. Learning from peers is considered critically important for police officers who, 
</p>
<p>according to Italy, have a &#8220;distinctive professional culture&#8221;. Thus, initial efforts are made to 
</p>
<p>train as many trainers as possible within the ranks. The National Police of Guinea has a 
</p>
<p>pool of some 25 human rights trainers in its ranks. In 2013, the Police Academy of 
</p>
<p>Romania founded a centre to promote human rights within public order and security 
</p>
<p>institutions, which now boasts 50 permanent trainers and another 271 resource persons to 
</p>
<p>carry out its mandate throughout the country, together with a network of officers to 
</p>
<p>disseminate procedures, laws and policies on human rights. In 2011, the Chilean National 
</p>
<p>Police established a human rights department to promote international standards for the 
</p>
<p>police. The Ecuadorian police has a similar department, which reaches some 600 officers 
</p>
<p>weekly. The Human Rights Committee established in the Ministry of the Interior of the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates, in 2013, comprises representatives from all police departments and 
</p>
<p>is charged with spreading awareness of and adherence to human rights. Colombia referred 
</p>
<p>to its procedures for evaluating trainers. 
</p>
<p>33. Materials used in human rights training are tailored specifically for law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers, for example, &#8220;performance criteria for law enforcement officers in terms of human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221; of the Gendarmerie General Command, Turkey; &#8220;Policing in a multicultural 
</p>
<p>society&#8221;, National Police of Italy manual for trainers; &#8220;Complementary instructional 
</p>
<p>module and Methodological guide on human rights, civil security and police functions&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>prepared by the Higher Academy for Police Studies, Chile, with the assistance of the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Institute of Human Rights; and from Poland, &#8220;To protect and to serve &#8211; how to 
</p>
<p>foster the rights attitudes and behaviours during primary professional training&#8221;. The 
</p>
<p>Directorate-General for National Security of Morocco prepared a guide for judicial police 
</p>
<p>officers, in collaboration with the National Human Rights Council and the Swiss Police 
</p>
<p>Institute produced a reference book on human rights and professional ethics. The Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice of Madagascar, with the assistance of international NGOs, prepared a handbook 
</p>
<p>on the prohibition of torture for law enforcement officials, while the United Arab Emirates 
</p>
<p>issued a guidebook of procedures for dealing with groups with special needs during pre-
</p>
<p>trial investigations. In Nepal, training manuals for police at every level include a section on 
</p>
<p>human rights and in Germany, tutorial notes on policing and human rights are available on 
</p>
<p>the Federal Police Intranet. OHCHR &#8220;Human rights standards and practice for the police&#8221; is 
</p>
<p>distributed to all police and gendarmerie training units  in a number of States (for example, 
</p>
<p>Algeria). 
</p>
<p>34. In-service training for police officers often focuses on specific human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>For example, in Greece such training addresses human rights provisions concerning the 
</p>
<p>prevention of torture, use of personal data, combating violence against women, human 
</p>
<p>trafficking, racism and xenophobia. Special emphasis on how to manage prejudices and 
</p>
<p>prevent discrimination was mentioned by several States. Switzerland reported that, in 2013, 
</p>
<p>the Swiss Police School had increased the time devoted to questions of discrimination as a 
</p>
<p>key area to be addressed in continuing training. Colombia mentioned standing orders and 
</p>
<p>directives relating to indigenous peoples and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
</p>
<p>persons, among others. In-service training in Germany provides information on foreign </p>


<p>cultures, religions and the background and root causes of migration, with the aim of 
</p>
<p>promoting tolerance and understanding for all. In Slovenia, police officers are trained in the 
</p>
<p>management of stereotypes in a multi-ethnic society, which includes learning about the 
</p>
<p>culture and history of Roma, encouraging awareness and increasing acceptance of diversity, 
</p>
<p>as well as seeking appropriate and consistent ways for police to work with people from 
</p>
<p>different backgrounds and in Portugal, police officers are being trained to act as mediators 
</p>
<p>in Roma communities. In-service training could involve other specialized expert institutions 
</p>
<p>and/or NGOs; the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman Office in Lithuania was mentioned in 
</p>
<p>this respect. 
</p>
<p>35. Guinea reported that its police and gendarmerie schools had also incorporated 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law in their training and had recently introduced a module on 
</p>
<p>child rights. A specialized police service created in Chile, in 2013, to strengthen relations 
</p>
<p>with indigenous communities is provided training on the rights of indigenous peoples, their 
</p>
<p>language and cultural identity. The Royal Gendarmerie of Morocco has been specially 
</p>
<p>trained on human rights in the fight against terrorism and against drugs, while regular in-
</p>
<p>service training is provided for gendarmerie staff in Turkey, with on-site training for the 
</p>
<p>provincial gendarmerie commands, in which equality and combating violence against 
</p>
<p>women are among the topics regularly addressed. Human rights and gender equality are  
</p>
<p>included in the training courses on combating trafficking in persons, drug trafficking and 
</p>
<p>other issues offered by the International Training Centre in Belarus. Combating trafficking 
</p>
<p>in human beings is also addressed in training courses for police officers in Kuwait and the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates, while in Ghana, special focus has been placed on sensitization of the 
</p>
<p>police to issues of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>36. Although human rights training is recommended for customs officers in Italy, such 
</p>
<p>training is only mandatory for those going on foreign assignments. In Japan, human rights 
</p>
<p>training is compulsory for newly recruited immigration officers and ongoing throughout 
</p>
<p>their service. Several European countries reported on human rights training conducted for 
</p>
<p>border police (for example, Romania, Slovenia and Switzerland). The Directorate-General 
</p>
<p>for National Security of Morocco has given lectures in the Royal Police Institute on refugee 
</p>
<p>rights, in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Refugees (UNHCR). 
</p>
<p>37. Within the European Union, Greece and Italy reported on the European Union 
</p>
<p>Frontex programme, which provides compulsory human rights training to border guards  
</p>
<p>participating in joint European operations. The Hellenic Coast Guard of Greece, under the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Shipping, has incorporated human rights in its training curriculum, as provided 
</p>
<p>for in the Frontex programme, to assist its guards in the treatment of victims of trafficking, 
</p>
<p>identification of asylum seekers, protection of minors and groups in situations of 
</p>
<p>vulnerability and practical application of the principle of non-refoulement. Training is 
</p>
<p>carried out by the Coast Guard and national police specially trained in human rights by 
</p>
<p>Frontex, using a manual developed with the support of the European Union. Continuous 
</p>
<p>training is made possible by UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross 
</p>
<p>(ICRC), and updated training is offered in particular to staff of pre-departure centres. 
</p>
<p>38. Human rights training is also a formal requirement in a number of countries for 
</p>
<p>prison staff, especially in-service training (for example, in Chile and France) and for 
</p>
<p>officials in particular (for example, in Estonia). Training is delivered in accordance with 
</p>
<p>level of experience and focuses on the rights of detainees, including international and 
</p>
<p>domestic standards on the use of force, prevention of torture and treatment of prisoners 
</p>
<p>(Japan, Morocco, Switzerland and Turkey). In 2014, the National Prison Institute of 
</p>
<p>Honduras began including human rights and gender in the basic training course for prison 
</p>
<p>officer candidates. In Estonia, the Prisons Department of the Ministry of Justice carries out 
</p>
<p>evaluation and impact assessments with regard to institutionalized human rights training. In </p>


<p>Burkina Faso, training on the rights of detainees is provided annually to prison guards. 
</p>
<p>Burundi reported under the universal periodic review that human rights training sessions for 
</p>
<p>prison officials had contributed to an improvement in the situation in prisons. 
</p>
<p>39. Human rights training for prison personnel also needs to be practical; Japan 
</p>
<p>mentioned practice-based, on-the-job training programmes, including role-playing, that 
</p>
<p>incorporated various events that occur on a daily basis in penal institutions. Morocco 
</p>
<p>reported on practice drills relating to inspection, handcuffing, discipline and deportation, 
</p>
<p>for example, and Greece mentioned prison visits, for example, for judicial police officers, 
</p>
<p>including exchanges with detainees. In 2013, a national meeting aimed at strengthening the 
</p>
<p>human rights competencies of penitentiary system public servants was held in Honduras. It 
</p>
<p>focused on the responsibilities of the State and its representatives as guarantors of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of persons deprived of their liberty. It was complemented by a series of 
</p>
<p>regional and local workshops for prison staff. Portugal is engaged in a project to develop an 
</p>
<p>e-learning tool for prison guards in countries in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America. 
</p>
<p>The Prisons Service in Ghana has its own training manual, which has been incorporated 
</p>
<p>into the training curriculum of prison officers. 
</p>
<p>40. The distinctive professional culture of law enforcement officers is shared across 
</p>
<p>national boundaries and there are many examples of international and regional, bilateral and 
</p>
<p>multilateral cooperation in this sector. Police officers in some small States (for example, 
</p>
<p>Andorra and Guyana, based on their reports under the universal periodic review) benefit 
</p>
<p>from training in partner States. The Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of 
</p>
<p>the Pacific Community provides training for police officers from the Pacific Islands. The 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights training and documentation centre for South-West Asia and 
</p>
<p>the Arab region, in cooperation with ICRC, has organized human rights workshops for 
</p>
<p>police officers. Greece alluded to the range of courses offered by the European Police 
</p>
<p>College. The Netherlands and Bulgaria operate bilateral exchanges of police officers and 
</p>
<p>the Italian <i>carabinieri</i> are twinned with the Turkish gendarmerie. Ecuador signed 
</p>
<p>agreements with the Dominican Republic and France on cooperation in relation to human 
</p>
<p>rights training for prison staff in the new Training Academy that was opened in 2011. Chile 
</p>
<p>now offers an international diploma course on &#8220;human rights and citizens&#8217; security in the 
</p>
<p>framework of policing&#8221;, which addresses such issues as the use of force. 
</p>
<p>41. Regional human rights mechanisms play a significant role in this sector. Law 
</p>
<p>enforcement personnel in a number of States are taught about the international and regional 
</p>
<p>dimensions of the protection of human rights, treaties and institutions. Frequent reference 
</p>
<p>was made regional standards and case law in the field of human rights &#8212; in particular with 
</p>
<p>respect to the European and Inter-American systems &#8212; and their application in the daily 
</p>
<p>work of law enforcement and prison officers. Regional mechanisms also offer an abundant 
</p>
<p>range of opportunities for cooperation, support and partnership. One example is the 
</p>
<p>comprehensive human rights training strategy adopted by police schools in Chile, in 
</p>
<p>association with the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>42. Cooperation and technical assistance for many of the programmes &#8212; with OHCHR, 
</p>
<p>UNHCR, UNICEF, other United Nations entities, ICRC, the European Union, other 
</p>
<p>regional organizations, international and national NGOs and national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, as well as inter-State partnership &#8212; are abundant. Such cooperation helps to 
</p>
<p>ensure coherence in the human rights training of the targeted professional groups and offers 
</p>
<p>opportunities for keeping up to date with developments. A number of States requested 
</p>
<p>further support in this area. </p>


<p><b> D. Human rights training for the military 
</b></p>
<p>43. Training in both international human rights and international humanitarian law seem 
</p>
<p>to be institutionalized in the basic training of the military in many States. In Colombia and 
</p>
<p>the Democratic Republic of the Congo, such training is provided for in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>Advanced training is often mandatory in order to qualify for promotion (for example, in 
</p>
<p>Colombia, Guinea, Honduras, Italy, Mexico and Togo). Reform of the defence sector in 
</p>
<p>Guinea introduced human rights and international humanitarian law in the training of 
</p>
<p>members of security and defence forces, as well as a new Code of Conduct, Code of 
</p>
<p>Military Justice and General Disciplinary Regulations of the Armed Forces compliant with 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations. The Internal Peace and Security Plan of the Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces of the Philippines (<i>Bayanihan</i>) is aimed at ensuring that members of the security 
</p>
<p>forces receive continuous training in human rights and international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>specifically with regard to their responsibility to protect human rights and human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. Switzerland and Honduras made special mention of the in-depth training of the 
</p>
<p>military police, which includes human rights. Indonesia reported under the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, in 2012, that human rights-based curricula had been introduced for 
</p>
<p>military officers at all levels and that a memorandum of understanding had been concluded 
</p>
<p>with the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights for human rights training.  
</p>
<p>44. In Colombia, a special medal is awarded for outstanding work in the area of human 
</p>
<p>rights and outstanding performance is also rewarded in Togo. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
</p>
<p>the Parliamentary Military Commissioner strengthens oversight of the armed forces and  
</p>
<p>protection of the human rights of those serving in the forces, while a human rights division 
</p>
<p>was created within the Ministry of Defence of Guinea, in 2015, with a senior military 
</p>
<p>officer in charge. 
</p>
<p>45. Japan conducts special training for the military on the treatment of prisoners of war. 
</p>
<p>It noted the importance of Security Council resolution 1325 and stated its intention to 
</p>
<p>formulate a national action plan for the military on women, peace and security, in 
</p>
<p>cooperation with NGOs. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported that it had developed an action 
</p>
<p>plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325, which included 
</p>
<p>workshops and lectures on gender equality. Switzerland described its specialized service for 
</p>
<p>preventing extremism in the army and Colombia stated that its security forces had made 
</p>
<p>significant steps with regard to those sectors of the population requiring special attention, 
</p>
<p>including indigenous peoples, persons of African descent, displaced persons, women, 
</p>
<p>children and others. In Mexico, training on linguistic and cultural diversity is organized for 
</p>
<p>members of the army who speak indigenous languages, so that they could act as mediators 
</p>
<p>during military operations.  
</p>
<p>46. Peer learning is regarded as being of critical importance in the military, given its 
</p>
<p>particular professional culture. All the military schools in Guinea have a pool of human 
</p>
<p>rights trainers. The study centre of the Mexican Army and Air Force provides human rights 
</p>
<p>courses to chiefs and officials to develop human rights knowledge and skills among leaders 
</p>
<p>and trainers. In Honduras, 39 military officers were trained to be human rights trainers and 
</p>
<p>contributed to the design and development of a methodology and materials, with a focus on 
</p>
<p>the application of standards, in practice, and special attention to groups in situations of 
</p>
<p>vulnerability. In Italy, human rights training is delivered by specially trained civil and 
</p>
<p>military staff as well as, when appropriate, by NGOs. In the military school of Colombia, 
</p>
<p>staff are trained in pedagogical techniques for teaching international human rights and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law. The Armed Forces Graduate School of Human Rights and International 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Law in the Dominican Republic offers some 106 courses on those topics and, 
</p>
<p>as at April 2013, had trained over 5,500 individuals. Major work had been under way for 
</p>
<p>some years in the Philippines to transform its security sector into one that is compliant with 
</p>
<p>human rights and international humanitarian law. The development of training curricula </p>


<p>and materials culminated in a new human rights action plan, designed on orders of the 
</p>
<p>Chief of Staff, covering education and training, awareness and advocacy, monitoring and 
</p>
<p>response procedures, issuance of reference certificates and exposure to best practices. 
</p>
<p>47. As in the case of training for law enforcement officials, most States provide practical 
</p>
<p>and participatory training for the military, taking into account the role and level of 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the recipients. In 2014, Colombia adopted a standard human rights and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law teaching model for the military, structured on six levels and setting out 
</p>
<p>learning according to the operational needs and levels of responsibility of the participants, 
</p>
<p>using a methodology based on practice. Training scenarios are adopted from real situations 
</p>
<p>and tactical training is combined with instruction in human rights and humanitarian law. At 
</p>
<p>the end of each training session, learning is evaluated and adjustments made, where 
</p>
<p>necessary. Colombia reported that the methods of instruction relating to international 
</p>
<p>human rights and humanitarian law are specifically tailored to meet the needs of the armed 
</p>
<p>forces in their current context. Honduras also highlighted the importance of educational 
</p>
<p>methodology that makes use of the instruction goals used in military training for mission 
</p>
<p>accomplishment. Switzerland has developed an interactive DVD, which contains practical 
</p>
<p>cases aimed at consolidating the theory acquired in basic training and, in 2013, the Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces Graduate School in the Dominican Republic organized a workshop to prepare a 
</p>
<p>manual on the use of force for the Dominican Armed Forces. Japan has been reviewing and 
</p>
<p>revising reference and training materials for the treatment of prisoners of war and, in 2014, 
</p>
<p>Mexico revised its military doctrine on the use of force to make it compliant with 
</p>
<p>international standards, with the technical support of its National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission, ICRC and OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>48. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guinea, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia and 
</p>
<p>Switzerland indicated that specialized human rights training is compulsory for military 
</p>
<p>personnel who are being deployed abroad, including training on international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law, where peace missions are concerned. 
</p>
<p>49. While OHCHR and other United Nations entities, regional organizations, 
</p>
<p>Governments, NGOs and national human rights institutions also assist in the provision of 
</p>
<p>human rights training for the military, support from ICRC remains critical for many States, 
</p>
<p>especially in respect of training on international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The foregoing overview is witness to the impressive amount of activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken by States to implement and support human rights education in higher 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and human rights training for civil servants, law enforcement officials and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the military during the second phase of the World Programme for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Education. Some of the initiatives had begun prior to the launch of the second phase 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the World Programme or were framed under regional initiatives, such as the Arab 
</b></p>
<p><b>plan to foster the culture of human rights education, endorsed by the Council of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>League of Arab States, in 2010. One thing is certain, they all substantially further 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress in human rights education and training in the target sectors. Furthermore, 
</b></p>
<p><b>related recommendations made to States in the context of the universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review seem to have had a significant impact in encouraging States to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes and in encouraging States and organizations to offer support. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Of the 28 States which submitted information specifically for this report, some 
</b></p>
<p><b>were able to make a solid evaluation of the activities carried out nationally to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement the second phase of the programme. Others provided details of individual 
</b></p>
<p><b>training days, while still others indicated that developed plans had yet to be put into </b></p>


<p><b>action. In Switzerland, the Swiss Centre of Expertise in Human Rights has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>charged with making an inventory of human rights education initiatives across the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country, while Slovenia identified a number of gaps in the process and was proceeding 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the identification of possible measures to close those gaps and the preparation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>guidelines for improving human rights education in the focus areas of the second 
</b></p>
<p><b>phase. Honduras adopted a national programme in 2012 and since then, has 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed content and methodology. Bosnia and Herzegovina regretted that it did not 
</b></p>
<p><b>have the resources to fully implement the recommendations of the workshop that it 
</b></p>
<p><b>had convened in 2012. All of those reports indicate that time is needed to advance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consolidate what has been achieved during the second phase. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>While the foregoing overview highlights the institutionalization of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>training for the targeted professional groups in a solid core of countries, there are 
</b></p>
<p><b>many other countries in which such training remains ad hoc and dependent on 
</b></p>
<p><b>external initiatives, which ultimately raises the question of sustainability. But the 
</b></p>
<p><b>responses also indicate that the tools and resources for improvement in the area of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights education and training are becoming more and more available. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>What is interesting is that the overview also indicates that there is increased 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the use of appropriate training methodologies that are practical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant to the learners and their work context. One recurrent aspect was the 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of peer-to-peer training for the targeted professional groups and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>active involvement of senior management at all stages of training, in particular in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>conception of training programmes. In addition, the expertise being built with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of pools of trainers in some States, as well as practice-based curricula 
</b></p>
<p><b>and materials, will help to secure quality and sustainability of the programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The extent of cooperation among government departments, as well as among 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments, academia, national human rights institutions and NGOs in any given 
</b></p>
<p><b>country appears particularly significant. Cooperation has also blossomed between 
</b></p>
<p><b>States and serves to encourage progress, ensure greater coherence and secure support 
</b></p>
<p><b>for States with fewer resources. As financial budgets diminish, synergies and alliances 
</b></p>
<p><b>are essential. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The information provided by States and the supplementary sources reveal a 
</b></p>
<p><b>wealth of opportunities for technical cooperation in human rights education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>training by United Nations entities, ICRC, regional organizations, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>individual Governments and NGOs. Similarly, there seem to be an increasing number 
</b></p>
<p><b>of regional initiatives, which States can both contribute to and benefit from, thereby 
</b></p>
<p><b>fostering a valuable exchange of experiences and cross-fertilization of ideas. Examples 
</b></p>
<p><b>mentioned include the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, the European 
</b></p>
<p><b>Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Europe and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Finally, and although word-limit constraints preclude details, the majority of 
</b></p>
<p><b>reports indicated that the work begun with the first phase of the World Programme, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in relation to primary and secondary schools, was continued and, in some cases, 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutionalized, thanks to the curricula developed, the number of teachers trained 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the materials available. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>While considerable progress has been made in some countries, all States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>take full advantage of the third phase of the World Programme for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Education to strengthen implementation of the first and second phases, with specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the second phase targeting higher education and training for teachers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials and military personnel.  </b></p>


<p>58. <b>To that end, the Human Rights Council, in resolution 24/15, encouraged States 
</b></p>
<p><b>and relevant stakeholders to place special emphasis on the following strategies: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Advancing implementation and consolidating the work done; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Providing human rights education and training for educators in formal 
</b></p>
<p><b>and non-formal education and training, in particular those working with children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>youth; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Undertaking related research and mapping, sharing good practices and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lessons learned, and sharing information among all actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Applying and strengthening sound educational methodologies based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>good practices and assessed through continued evaluation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Fostering dialogue, cooperation, networking and information-sharing 
</b></p>
<p><b>among relevant stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Furthering the integration of human rights education and training into 
</b></p>
<p><b>school and training curricula. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Detailed guidance on these strategies is provided</b> <b>in the plan of action for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>third phase (2015</b>&#8211;<b>2019) of the World Programme (see A/HRC/27/18 and Add.1).</b>  
</p>
<p>60 <b>States who have not yet done so, should make an inventory of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives relating to the second phase of the World Programme, taking stock of 
</b></p>
<p><b>national progress against the guidance in the plan of action for the second phase in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to develop and implement a national strategy, which should make optimal use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing national, regional and international resources. </b></p>
