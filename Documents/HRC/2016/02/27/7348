</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur presents her findings and concerns regarding (a) the 
</p>
<p>independence and impartiality of the judiciary, including respect for the principle of 
</p>
<p>separation of powers, the selection and appointment of judges and the impartiality of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary; (b) non-Qatari judges; (c) accountability and disciplinary measures for judges; 
</p>
<p>(d) fair trial, due process guarantees and the administration of justice; (e) access to justice 
</p>
<p>and the situation of migrant workers; (f) women in the justice system; (g) prosecution 
</p>
<p>services; (h) lawyers; and (i) education and training. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur recognizes that Qatar has come a long way in a short time 
</p>
<p>with respect to developing its justice system. Yet, in spite of Qatar&#8217;s progress and 
</p>
<p>achievements, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the challenges and shortcomings 
</p>
<p>she identified are serious and negatively affect the independence and impartiality of the 
</p>
<p>justice system, as well as the realization of people&#8217;s human rights. If left unaddressed, those 
</p>
<p>challenges and shortcomings will also undermine positive reform efforts.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, 
</p>
<p>visited Qatar from 19 to 26 January 2014 at the invitation of the Government. She wishes to 
</p>
<p>commend the Government&#8217;s recent engagement with human rights mechanisms and hopes 
</p>
<p>that this engagement will continue and be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to examine, in the spirit of cooperation and dialogue, 
</p>
<p>both the achievements and shortcomings of Qatar in ensuring the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and the free exercise of the legal profession. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>concentrated on key issues regarding the administration of justice, such as due process and 
</p>
<p>fair trial guarantees, access to justice and legal aid, the position of women in the justice 
</p>
<p>system, accountability of judges and challenges related to the independence of non-Qatari 
</p>
<p>judges. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Doha, where she met with a number of senior 
</p>
<p>government officials at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Interior and Labour, as 
</p>
<p>well as the Chief Justice of the Court of Cassation and other members of the judiciary, the 
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, the speaker of the Advisory Council and lawyers. She also met with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Qatar Financial Centre Authority and the Qatar International Court 
</p>
<p>and Dispute Resolution Centre, the National Human Rights Committee and the diplomatic 
</p>
<p>community, as well as other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to warmly thank the Government of Qatar for its 
</p>
<p>invitation and engagement with her mandate, while fully respecting her independence. She 
</p>
<p>notes with appreciation that, in the region, Qatar was the first State to issue a standing 
</p>
<p>invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, on 1 June 2010, and the 
</p>
<p>first to create a National Human Rights Institution in accordance with the principles relating 
</p>
<p>to the status of national institutions (Paris Principles). She also thanks the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab 
</p>
<p>Region for its dedicated support in organizing the visit, and all those who dedicated their 
</p>
<p>time to share their expertise and opinions with her. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Justice system 
</b></p>
<p>5. A dual judicial system, composed of sharia and adlia courts, prevailed in Qatar from 
</p>
<p>its independence in 1971 until the enactment of Law No. 10 of 2003, which set up a unified 
</p>
<p>court system. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Permanent Constitution of Qatar was ratified by public referendum on 29 April 
</p>
<p>2003, promulgated by the Emir on 8 June 2004 and entered into force on 9 June 2005. It 
</p>
<p>recognizes the principle of separation of powers in its article 60. 
</p>
<p>7. The judicial authority is regulated by chapter five of part IV of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>which includes provisions establishing the supremacy of the law (article 129) and 
</p>
<p>recognizing the independence of the judiciary (articles 130 and 131), that judges shall not 
</p>
<p>be removed from office arbitrarily (article 134), that court sessions shall be public 
</p>
<p>(article 133) and that everyone shall have access to the courts (article 135). Chapter five 
</p>
<p>also enshrines the existence of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, the body in charge of 
</p>
<p>the administration of the courts (article 137). The Constitution further defines the general 
</p>
<p>role of the Attorney-General as that of conducting public prosecution in the name of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>people, supervising law enforcement and ensuring the application of criminal laws 
</p>
<p>(article 136). 
</p>
<p>8. In addition, the Constitution guarantees in its part III a selected list of fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms. Of interest to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, guarantees relating to 
</p>
<p>equality before the law, the principle of legality, the right not to be arbitrarily arrested and 
</p>
<p>detained, the presumption of innocence and the right to defend oneself are enshrined. 
</p>
<p>Finally, article 6 of the Constitution stipulates that the State shall respect and strive to 
</p>
<p>implement all international conventions and agreements to which it is a party. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Qatar is governed by a legal system based on a mixture of civil law and sharia (or 
</p>
<p>Islamic law); sharia law is recognized in the Constitution as the principal source of 
</p>
<p>legislation (article 1). British common law-inspired legislation is also applied by the 
</p>
<p>institutions of the Qatar Financial Centre (see below). Some of the most fundamental pieces 
</p>
<p>of legislation related to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur are listed in this section. 
</p>
<p>10. The judiciary is governed by Law No. 10 of 2003 &#8220;on the Judicial Authority&#8221; (as 
</p>
<p>amended), which establishes, inter alia, the structure, composition, jurisdiction and internal 
</p>
<p>functioning of the courts; the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, its composition and 
</p>
<p>competence; the recruitment conditions, appointment, promotion, tenure and retirement age 
</p>
<p>of judges; and the independence, duties and accountability of judges, as well as disciplinary 
</p>
<p>procedures. Law No. 10 of 2003 was complemented by Law No. 12 of 2008, which set up a 
</p>
<p>Supreme Constitutional Court (not yet operational, see below). 
</p>
<p>11.  Law No. 10 of 2002 &#8220;on the Public Prosecution&#8221; (as amended) established the 
</p>
<p>public prosecution as an independent judicial body headed by the Attorney-General. The 
</p>
<p>law sets out the composition and hierarchy of the public prosecution; the recruitment 
</p>
<p>conditions, appointment, promotion, tenure and retirement age of prosecutors; and the 
</p>
<p>duties and accountability of prosecutors, as well as disciplinary procedures. The Law also 
</p>
<p>determines the powers of the public prosecution, which include, among other functions 
</p>
<p>prescribed by the law, the investigation of crimes and the supervision of the investigation 
</p>
<p>when delegated; the initiation of criminal cases, their conduct before the courts and the 
</p>
<p>launching of appeals against judgments and all procedures related thereto; and the 
</p>
<p>monitoring of prisons and other places of detention. 
</p>
<p>12. The rights and duties of lawyers are defined in Law No. 23 of 2006 &#8220;on the Code of 
</p>
<p>Law Practice&#8221;, which also regulates the conditions to be admitted and registered as a 
</p>
<p>practicing lawyer; disciplinary proceedings and measures; the provision of free legal aid; 
</p>
<p>and the allocation of licenses to practice law to international firms and permits to practice 
</p>
<p>law to non-Qatari lawyers. 
</p>
<p>13. The legal framework is further completed by the Penal Code (Law No. 11 of 2004, 
</p>
<p>as amended) and the Civil Code (Law No. 22 of 2004); the Criminal Procedure Code (Law 
</p>
<p>No. 23 of 2004, as amended) and the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law (Law No. 13 
</p>
<p>of 1990, as amended), both of which the Government recognized needed updating; and Law 
</p>
<p>No. 12 of 2005 on Procedures in Non-penal Cassation Appeals (as amended). 
</p>
<p>14. At the international level, Qatar is a State party to several human rights treaties, 
</p>
<p>including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>15. At the regional level, Qatar ratified the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which 
</p>
<p>contains a comprehensive set of binding provisions related to the mandate of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, including the right to an effective remedy for violations of the rights and 
</p>
<p>freedom recognized in the Charter (article 23); the right to liberty and security of person 
</p>
<p>and protection from arbitrary arrest (article 14); equality and non-discrimination before the 
</p>
<p>law (article 11); recognition of all as a person before the law (article 22); equality before 
</p>
<p>the courts and tribunals (article 12); the independence of the judiciary and protection from 
</p>
<p>interference and threats (article 12); fair trial before and independent, impartial and 
</p>
<p>competent tribunal (article 13); the principle of <i>nullum crimen sine lege</i> (article 15); a series 
</p>
<p>of due process and fair trial guarantees in criminal cases, including the principle of 
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence (article 16); and the principle of <i>ne bis in idem</i> (article 19). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Court structure 
</b></p>
<p>16. All the courts are currently concentrated in Doha, but the Supreme Council of the 
</p>
<p>Judiciary has the competence to create departments of the Court of First Instance in other 
</p>
<p>cities, and hearings can take place at locations away from the home courts. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Supreme Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Supreme Constitutional Court was established by Law No. 12 of 2008 but is not 
</p>
<p>yet operational. The main purpose of the Court is to settle disputes over the constitutionality 
</p>
<p>of laws and regulations in Qatar (article 12). The Court also has jurisdiction to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>settle disputes of competence between courts and review, upon appeal, decisions of lower 
</p>
<p>courts on any matter of law or legal inference (article 12). Its judgements and decisions are 
</p>
<p>final (article 27). 
</p>
<p>18. The Constitutional Court should be composed of a president, appointed by an order 
</p>
<p>of the Emir, and six judges, appointed by a decree of the Emir (article 2). A General 
</p>
<p>Assembly consisting of all the members of the Court is in charge of all matters relating to 
</p>
<p>regulation of the Court, internal matters and matters related to its members (article 5). 
</p>
<p>19. The Supreme Constitutional Court was scheduled to start functioning on 1 October 
</p>
<p>2008. On 27 September 2009, the Emir reportedly appointed its president, yet at the time of 
</p>
<p>writing none of the remaining six judges had been appointed and the Court was still not 
</p>
<p>functioning. While administrative and logistical reasons were cited for the delay, it remains 
</p>
<p>unclear why the Court is not yet operational more than five years after the enactment of the 
</p>
<p>law that established it. The Special Rapporteur wishes to strongly encourage that the Court 
</p>
<p>be formed, start functioning as early as possible and be provided with all the resources and 
</p>
<p>guarantees necessary for its full independence and proper administration. 
</p>
<p>20. A special chamber within the Court of Cassation reportedly used to consider 
</p>
<p>constitutional issues, but its existence ceased with the enactment of Law No. 12 of 2008. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, because of the important delay in 
</p>
<p>operationalizing the Supreme Constitutional Court, it is currently impossible to appeal the 
</p>
<p>constitutionality of laws in Qatar. This could create legal uncertainty and jeopardize the 
</p>
<p>enforcement of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Court of Cassation 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Court of Cassation was established by Law No. 10 of 2003 as the highest court 
</p>
<p>of appeal; it has competence to review both rulings and proceedings of the law. 
</p>
<p>Constitutional issues can in theory be appealed to the Supreme Constitutional Court, but 
</p>
<p>this Court has yet to become operational. The Court comprises different circuits or 
</p>
<p>chambers to &#8220;hear appeals on the interpretation of provisions and measures enacted by law&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>(article 6). The circuits are established by resolution of the Supreme Council of the 
</p>
<p>Judiciary and its members are appointed by the president of the Court. 
</p>
<p>22. The Court of Cassation is composed of a president, appointed by order of the Emir, 
</p>
<p>and a sufficient number of vice-presidents and judges, appointed by decree of the Emir 
</p>
<p>upon proposition of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. The Court also has a General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, consisting of all of the Court&#8217;s judges, which has competence to consider a 
</p>
<p>number of issues, including the formation of circuits, the allocation of cases to different 
</p>
<p>circuits, the organization of work during judicial vacation and other issues relating to the 
</p>
<p>internal affairs of the Court. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Court of Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Court of Appeal was also established by Law No. 10 of 2003. It comprises 
</p>
<p>different circuits or chambers set up by resolution of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary 
</p>
<p>to hear appeals of orders, ruling and sentencing in <i>Hudud</i> (ordained punishment) and <i>Qisas</i> 
</p>
<p>(retribution) cases, criminal cases, civil and commercial cases, family and personal status-
</p>
<p>related cases, inheritance cases and administrative or other disputes. The members of the 
</p>
<p>different circuits are appointed by the president of the Court. 
</p>
<p>24. The Court of Appeal is composed of a president and a sufficient number of 
</p>
<p>presidents, vice-presidents and judges appointed by decree of the Emir upon proposition of 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. The Court also has a General Assembly, consisting 
</p>
<p>of all of the Court&#8217;s judges, with the same competence as the General Assembly of the 
</p>
<p>Court of Cassation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Court of First Instance 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Court of First Instance was also established by Law No. 10 of 2003. It 
</p>
<p>comprises different circuits or chambers set up by resolution of the Supreme Council of the 
</p>
<p>Judiciary with jurisdiction over <i>Hudud</i> and <i>Qisas</i> cases, as well as criminal, civil, 
</p>
<p>commercial, family and personal status-related, inheritance, administrative and other cases. 
</p>
<p>The members of the circuits are appointed by the president of the Court. 
</p>
<p>26. The Court of First Instance is composed of a president and a sufficient number of 
</p>
<p>presidents and judges appointed by decree of the Emir upon proposition of the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Council of the Judiciary. The Court also has a General Assembly consisting of all the 
</p>
<p>Court&#8217;s judges with the same competence as the General Assemblies of the Courts of 
</p>
<p>Cassation and Appeal. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Supreme Council of the Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Supreme Council of the Judiciary was first established in 1999 to ensure the 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary before being subsequently enshrined in both Law No. 10 of 
</p>
<p>2003 (chapter five) and the Constitution of 2004 (article 137). In a welcome development, 
</p>
<p>the Council took over from the Ministry of Justice with regard to the administration of the 
</p>
<p>courts. Its competence, as defined by the law, includes expressing its opinion on issues 
</p>
<p>relating to the judiciary and studying and proposing legislation for the development of the 
</p>
<p>judicial system; expressing its opinion on the appointment, promotion, transfer and 
</p>
<p>assignment, secondment and retirement of judges; and considering grievances relating to 
</p>
<p>judicial affairs. The Council can also exercise any other functions prescribed to it by law, as 
</p>
<p>well as consider issues which the president of the Council decides to bring to its attention. 
</p>
<p>28. The Council is composed of seven members who are all judges: the president of the 
</p>
<p>Court of Cassation (who is also the Council&#8217;s president), its most senior vice-president 
</p>
<p>(who is also the Council&#8217;s vice-president) and its most senior judge; the president of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>Court of Appeal, its most senior vice-president and its most senior judge; and the president 
</p>
<p>of the Court of First Instance. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Qatar Financial Centre 
</b></p>
<p>29. Law No. 7 of 2005 created the Qatar Financial Centre (QFC), an entity with its own 
</p>
<p>institutions and authorities and designed &#8220;to attract international banking, financial services, 
</p>
<p>insurance activities, headquarter of businesses and other businesses&#8221; (article 5). According 
</p>
<p>to the Law, the QFC&#8217;s authorities can legislate on issues under QFC competence and pass 
</p>
<p>regulations grounded in common law. 
</p>
<p>30. Law No. 2 of 2009 established the QFC Regulatory Tribunal (article 4) and the Civil 
</p>
<p>and Commercial Court (article 5), also referred to as the Qatar International Court. Both 
</p>
<p>judicial bodies are considered courts of Qatar, but they are set apart from the ordinary court 
</p>
<p>structure established by Law No. 10 of 2003 and apply a different set of legal provisions 
</p>
<p>and procedures. 
</p>
<p>31. The QFC Regulatory Tribunal was set up to hear appeals of decisions of any QFC 
</p>
<p>authority or body. The Tribunal is composed of a president and a sufficient number of 
</p>
<p>judges appointed by the Council of Ministers for a term of five years, renewable. The 
</p>
<p>president is in charge of the administration of the Tribunal. The Tribunal applies the QFC 
</p>
<p>law, amendments and regulations. When QFC law and regulations and the procedural rules 
</p>
<p>set by the Tribunal are silent on a matter, the Tribunal will apply Qatar&#8217;s Civil and 
</p>
<p>Commercial Procedures Law. The decisions of the Regulatory Tribunal are enforceable and 
</p>
<p>can only be appealed to the appeal circuit of the Civil and Commercial Court. 
</p>
<p>32. The Civil and Commercial Court was created as a specialized court to resolve 
</p>
<p>disputes between institutions and other bodies in Qatar, as well as to serve as an appeal 
</p>
<p>body from decisions of the QFC Regulatory Tribunal. The Court is composed of a president 
</p>
<p>and a sufficient number of judges appointed by the Council of Ministers for a term of five 
</p>
<p>years, renewable. The president is in charge of the administration of the Court. The Court 
</p>
<p>comprises a first instance circuit and an appeal circuit. The Court applies QFC law and 
</p>
<p>regulations if the dispute relates to a QFC matter. Where the parties consent to the Court&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, the Court will apply the law applicable to the dispute, for example, the law 
</p>
<p>chosen by the parties in a contract. Decisions of the trial circuit are enforceable and can 
</p>
<p>only be appealed to the appeal circuit. Decisions of the appeal circuit are final. 
</p>
<p>33. The Qatar Financial Centre created de jure and de facto a parallel judicial system. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was informed that a rapprochement was under way between the 
</p>
<p>two justice systems; a law was reportedly drafted in June 2012, but not yet passed to clarify 
</p>
<p>the relationship between the Civil and Commercial Court and the QFC Regulatory Tribunal 
</p>
<p>and the ordinary court system; the law would place both specialized courts under the 
</p>
<p>umbrella of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the proper administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>34. The current judicial system in Qatar was recently established and is still under 
</p>
<p>development. It faces major shortcomings and challenges, which directly affect the delivery 
</p>
<p>of justice and the realization of human rights. These shortcomings and challenges must be 
</p>
<p>assessed and addressed in a timely fashion in order to bring the administration of justice in 
</p>
<p>line with international human rights standards. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1

</b></p>
<p><b> A. Independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Separation of powers and interferences in the independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>35. It is the principle of the separation of powers, together with the rule of law, which 
</p>
<p>opens the way to an administration of justice that provides guarantees of independence, 
</p>
<p>impartiality and transparency. For this reason, there should be clear demarcation between 
</p>
<p>the respective competences of the different branches of power. A situation where the 
</p>
<p>functions and competencies of the judiciary and the executive are not clearly 
</p>
<p>distinguishable, or where the latter is able to control or direct the former, is incompatible 
</p>
<p>with the notion of an independent tribunal.
1
 
</p>
<p>36. While any direct interference in the independence of judges is extremely difficult to 
</p>
<p>document, reports of pressures of the executive on the work of the judiciary, particularly in 
</p>
<p>cases involving powerful persons, are a matter of concern to the Special Rapporteur. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in 2009, 33 Qatari judges reportedly tendered their resignation to protest over 
</p>
<p>what they had described as continued interference in their work. Regretfully, no 
</p>
<p>information regarding whether or not the allegations had been appropriately investigated 
</p>
<p>was provided to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>37. Several interlocutors expressed serious concerns regarding limitations to the 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the courts. According to article 13 of the Law on the Judicial Authority, 
</p>
<p>courts have no competence over issues related to sovereignty and nationality. Under Law 
</p>
<p>No. 7 of 2007 on the Settlement of Administrative Disputes (as amended), which set up 
</p>
<p>administrative circuits in the Courts of First Instance and Appeal, Emiri orders, resolutions 
</p>
<p>and decrees, resolutions issued under Law No. 17 of 2002, and decisions issued under the 
</p>
<p>laws on private associations and foundations, publications, the entry, residence and 
</p>
<p>deportation of foreigners, inter alia, are excluded from the competence of the courts. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur wishes to note that, in accordance with to the Basic Principles on the 
</p>
<p>Independence of the Judiciary, the courts shall have jurisdiction over all issues of a judicial 
</p>
<p>nature. The limitations set to the jurisdiction of the courts could also lead to the denial of an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>38. Finally, the Special Rapporteur believes that it is important to note when discussing 
</p>
<p>the separation of powers that the legislative branch is not clearly separated from the 
</p>
<p>executive power. Indeed, the 35 members of the current Advisory Council were appointed 
</p>
<p>by the Emir and the Council has no formal legislative role. The Permanent Constitution 
</p>
<p>made provision for the formation of a 45-member Advisory Council, 30 members of which 
</p>
<p>would be elected by direct, general and secret ballot, with a limited legislative authority to 
</p>
<p>draft and approve laws. Yet, elections were not held and the former Advisory Council 
</p>
<p>remains in place. No date for these elections has been announced so far. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Selection and appointment of judges 
</b></p>
<p>39. All judges, including non-Qataris, are appointed by the Emir upon proposition of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Council of the Judiciary (as way of exception the president of the Court of 
</p>
<p>Cassation is directly appointed by the Emir). Several interlocutors declared that being 
</p>
<p>appointed by the Emir gave judges legitimacy and protection. Despite such affirmations, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur is concerned that this current mechanism for appointing judges may 
</p>
<p>expose them to undue political pressure. Appointments or nominations by the Emir can 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See general comment 32 of the International covenant on civil and political rights, available from 
</p>
<p>CCPR/C/GC/32. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>have a strong influence on judges&#8217; attitudes and behaviour, particularly concerning 
</p>
<p>representatives of the executive. 
</p>
<p>40. The selection of judges is, however, under the purview of the Supreme Council of 
</p>
<p>the Judiciary, composed of seven judges appointed ex officio. The basic requirements and 
</p>
<p>qualifications to become a judge are listed in Law No. 10 of 2003. The selection process to 
</p>
<p>join the judiciary is set in two steps. First, a candidate must be selected and be nominated as 
</p>
<p>assistant judge by the Council. The position of assistant judge lasts three years, including 
</p>
<p>one year of compulsory training at the Centre for Legal and Judicial Studies, where the 
</p>
<p>assistant has to pass both oral and written examinations, some carried out in an anonymous 
</p>
<p>manner. After this mandatory period, the application of the candidate will be considered 
</p>
<p>again by the Council, which will decide whether or not to recommend the appointment. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the importance of the establishment and 
</p>
<p>application of clear, objective and transparent criteria, related in particular to qualifications, 
</p>
<p>integrity, ability and efficiency, in the selection of judges, in order not only to identify the 
</p>
<p>most suitable candidates and increase the perception of a fair selection process, but also to 
</p>
<p>secure their independence. In this context, competitive examinations conducted at least 
</p>
<p>partly in a written and anonymous manner can serve as an important tool in the selection 
</p>
<p>process. 
</p>
<p>42. The security of tenure of Qatari judges is guaranteed until the mandatory retirement 
</p>
<p>age set forth in the law (70 years, with the possibility of exceptional extension). The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is nevertheless troubled by article 63, paragraph 5, of Law No. 10 of 2003, 
</p>
<p>according to which the Emir has competence to dismiss judges &#8220;in the public interest&#8221;. In 
</p>
<p>her view, such ground for dismissal is vague and does not comply with international 
</p>
<p>standards regarding disciplinary measures against judges. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Impartiality 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reported instances of lack of impartiality, 
</p>
<p>bias and improper behaviour of judges. She heard some serious allegations, according to 
</p>
<p>which not only the police and prosecutors would discriminate against non-nationals, but 
</p>
<p>also judges. Among foreigners residing in Qatar, the dominant perception is that the courts 
</p>
<p>do not treat Qataris in the same way. Some interlocutors also noted that this alleged 
</p>
<p>discriminatory attitude against foreigners is not manifested in the same way and with the 
</p>
<p>same strength, depending on the nationality of the person or his or her economic or work 
</p>
<p>status in the country. 
</p>
<p>44. It is worth noting that the State has the obligation under international human rights 
</p>
<p>law to guarantee the right to a fair trial to all individuals within its jurisdiction regardless of 
</p>
<p>nationality or any other status. Judges should also perform their judicial functions without 
</p>
<p>favour, bias or prejudice and should not manifest, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice 
</p>
<p>towards any person or group on irrelevant grounds, including race, colour, sex, religion or 
</p>
<p>national origin.
2
 The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline the importance of an impartial 
</p>
<p>and proper behaviour of judges, including when making decisions and passing judgments, 
</p>
<p>as foreigners living in Qatar already by far outnumber nationals, and such imbalance is 
</p>
<p>foreseen to increase in the near future. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur was told that, while judges and prosecutors have separate 
</p>
<p>chambers on court premises, they often sit and chat together and enter courtrooms together. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also heard claims that judges and prosecutors discuss minutes of 
</p>
<p>court hearings together. As noted in the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, in his or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>her personal relations with individual members of the legal profession, a judge should avoid 
</p>
<p>situations that might reasonably give rise to suspicion or appearance of favouritism or 
</p>
<p>partiality, especially when such situations are to the detriment of the right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>defence or the independence of lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Judges who are non-nationals of Qatar 
</b></p>
<p>46. Many judges from other Arab countries are recruited to serve in the Qatari judiciary 
</p>
<p>on a temporary basis. The salaries and allowances offered are extremely competitive and 
</p>
<p>interested candidates are easily found in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco or the 
</p>
<p>Sudan. Such a phenomenon is far from common throughout the world. According to the 
</p>
<p>authorities, hiring non-Qatari judges became necessary to cope with the lack of qualified 
</p>
<p>and interested nationals. The authorities also said that the Qatari judiciary needs the 
</p>
<p>expertise of non-Qatari judges to train their less experienced Qatari colleagues and support 
</p>
<p>the development of the judicial system. In the longer term, the judiciary would only be 
</p>
<p>composed of nationals. 
</p>
<p>47. The independence of these non-Qatari judges is a complex issue that requires careful 
</p>
<p>consideration. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no official figures on non-Qatari judges 
</p>
<p>were provided during the visit, including their number, countries of origin, years spent 
</p>
<p>working in Qatar, distribution at various hierarchical levels or how they were selected.  
</p>
<p>48. The tenure of non-Qatari judges is not guaranteed in the same way as that of national 
</p>
<p>judges. According to the information received, they are recruited under temporary contracts 
</p>
<p>that have to be renewed annually. The total length of the contract nevertheless depends on 
</p>
<p>the rules regulating their secondment in their country of origin. Therefore, a non-Qatari 
</p>
<p>judge&#8217;s contract can only be renewed up to a certain number of years, which may vary 
</p>
<p>depending on his country of origin. For this reason, the authorities explained that the 
</p>
<p>temporary nature of non-Qatari judges&#8217; tenure is inevitable. 
</p>
<p>49. Even if no cases were reported, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that non-Qatari 
</p>
<p>judges can be dismissed at any time, which renders them extremely vulnerable to pressures 
</p>
<p>from any side, including from the public prosecution, lawyers and the executive. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the social benefits and allowances allocated to national and non-Qatari judges are 
</p>
<p>allegedly different. 
</p>
<p>50. While the Special Rapporteur understands the rationale behind the hiring of non-
</p>
<p>Qatari judges and its limitations, she remains concerned about their independence. She also 
</p>
<p>believes that more could be done to secure the tenure of non-Qatari judges, even if only for 
</p>
<p>a fixed period of time. Their conditions of work also need to be revised as no discrimination 
</p>
<p>should be tolerated between national and non-Qatari judges, except that brought on by the 
</p>
<p>rules of secondment of the country of origin. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur would also like to note that the reduction of the number of 
</p>
<p>non-Qatari judges is a legitimate path for the Qatari authorities to follow. However, such a 
</p>
<p>process must only be implemented in full conformity with the international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations of the State and its national legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability and disciplinary measures 
</b></p>
<p>52. Another shortcoming affecting the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is 
</p>
<p>the absence of a written code of conduct or ethics for judges of the ordinary court system. It 
</p>
<p>is important to bear in mind that the requirement of independence and impartiality does not 
</p>
<p>aim at benefitting the judges themselves, but rather the court users, as part of their </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>inalienable right to a fair trial. Integrity and accountability are therefore essential elements 
</p>
<p>of judicial independence and intrinsically linked to the implementation of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>While Law No. 10 of 2003 provides some elements on the infractions triggering 
</p>
<p>disciplinary measures, detailed guidance needs to be provided to judges on the types of 
</p>
<p>infractions that will give rise to disciplinary measures. Judges of the Qatar International 
</p>
<p>Court and the QFC Regulatory Tribunal have their own Judicial Code of Conduct based on 
</p>
<p>the principles of independence, impartiality, integrity and propriety. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Fair trial, due process guarantees and administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was seriously concerned by the allegations of violations of 
</p>
<p>due process and fair trial guarantees described to her during her visit, the consequences 
</p>
<p>such violations have on people&#8217;s lives and the respect for their human rights. Complaints of 
</p>
<p>violations of due process and fair trial need to be investigated immediately and seriously by 
</p>
<p>the relevant authorities and urgent measures taken to redress the situations. Such measures 
</p>
<p>of redress may include the revision of judgements and sentences and/or the granting of 
</p>
<p>compensations. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to bring to the attention 
</p>
<p>of the Qatari authorities the following cases which, in her opinion, were tarnished by a 
</p>
<p>series of serious violations of the right to a fair trial and/or serious breaches of due process: 
</p>
<p>the case of Juan Pablo Irragori M&#233;dina; the case of Matthew and Grace Huang; the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Villagio-fire&#8221; case; and the case of Malika Alouane, Mahmoud Bouneb and Haytham 
</p>
<p>Qudaih. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Arbitrary arrest and pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>54. According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, persons who are arrested must be 
</p>
<p>presented to the prosecutor within 24 hours; the prosecutor in turn has 24 hours to order the 
</p>
<p>remand or release of the person. Prosecutors can order pretrial detention for up to eight 
</p>
<p>days. After that period, the detention can only be prolonged by court order. No limit is 
</p>
<p>provided to pretrial detention, except that it &#8220;must not exceed half of the maximum penalty 
</p>
<p>established for the offence&#8221;, which could result extremely problematic in cases of long 
</p>
<p>sentences. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is further alarmed that the guarantees provided by the Code 
</p>
<p>of Criminal Procedures against arbitrary arrest and detention do not apply to persons 
</p>
<p>arrested under Law No. 17 of 2002 on the Protection of the Community,
3
 Law No. 3 of 
</p>
<p>2004 on Combating Terrorism
4
 and Law No. 5 of 2003 establishing the State Security 
</p>
<p>Service.
5
 Under these laws, persons can be detained for lengthy periods of time without 
</p>
<p>charge and fundamental safeguards, including access to a lawyer or the possibility to 
</p>
<p>challenge the legality of the detention before a judge.  
</p>
<p>56. Anyone arrested without a warrant and/or detained beyond the period provided for 
</p>
<p>in the law without having been presented to a judge should be released. The powers 
</p>
<p>extended to the Minister of the Interior under the Law on the Protection of the Community 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Law No. 17 of 2002 allows the Minister of Interior to order the provisional detention of anyone 
</p>
<p>suspected of crimes involving State security, honour, decency or public morals for up to one year, 
</p>
<p>with possibility of extension upon consent of the Prime Minister. The detention can only be appealed 
</p>
<p>before the Prime Minister. 
</p>
<p> 4 Law No. 3 of 2004 on Combating Terrorism entitles the prosecutor to order pretrial detention of a 
</p>
<p>person suspected of a crime covered by the law for up to six months without judicial review. 
</p>
<p> 5 Under Law No. 5 of 2003, persons accused of a crime falling under the purview of the State Security 
</p>
<p>Service can be detained for up to 30 days by the Service before being presented to a prosecutor. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>also constitute a serious interference of the executive branch in the prerogatives of the 
</p>
<p>prosecution and the judiciary. In addition, the crimes falling under the purview of these 
</p>
<p>three laws are vaguely defined, which is in contradiction with the principle of legality. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Transparency and access to information 
</b></p>
<p>57. The apparent lack of transparency during both the investigation phase and court 
</p>
<p>proceedings remains a matter of great concern for the Special Rapporteur. Many 
</p>
<p>interlocutors reported that it was extremely difficult to know what happens in the courts, 
</p>
<p>whether you were a defendant or a victim. It was also reported to the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>that some hearings were held in camera without justifications based on exceptional 
</p>
<p>circumstances. When hearings are held in closed sessions without proper justification, in 
</p>
<p>contradiction to the right to a fair and public hearing, the fairness of the entire judicial 
</p>
<p>process can be put at risk. Closed hearings also contribute to the public&#8217;s lack of confidence 
</p>
<p>in the courts. 
</p>
<p>58. The lack of technology used during some court hearings contributes to the lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency of court hearings. Court minutes are reportedly still hand written, which more 
</p>
<p>than often causes serious inaccuracies. Such practices disservice justice and open the door 
</p>
<p>to further manipulation. For instance, it was reported to the Special Rapporteur that the 
</p>
<p>minutes of a high-level case where the hearings were held in camera did not accurately 
</p>
<p>reflect that the sessions were indeed closed. In another case, the defendant did not receive 
</p>
<p>all the transcripts of the hearings. As a result, the content of the missing hearings were not 
</p>
<p>taken into account in the appeal process to the detriment of the defendant and of the fair 
</p>
<p>exercise of justice. 
</p>
<p>59. In some instances, lawyers also seem to be confronted with serious difficulties in 
</p>
<p>gaining access to information, in particular during the investigation phase of criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>Lawyers&#8217; full access to appropriate information, files and documents in the possession or 
</p>
<p>control of the authorities has to be guaranteed in practice. Such access should be already 
</p>
<p>accorded at the investigative stage in order to allow for the preparation of an adequate 
</p>
<p>defence in conformity with the principle of equality of arms. Appropriate information 
</p>
<p>includes all materials that are exculpatory or that the prosecution plans to offer in court 
</p>
<p>against the accused. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed to hear that, in the so-called and infamous 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Villagio&#8221; case, where 19 persons, including 13 children, many of them foreigners, 
</p>
<p>perished in a fire in a shopping mall, the report of the independent expert investigation 
</p>
<p>carried out to establish the facts was never communicated in its entirety to the parties. In 
</p>
<p>another case, the defendants, former employees of a television network, did not have access 
</p>
<p>to any information during the investigation phase and were only informed of the charges 
</p>
<p>pending against them at the third court hearing. It was therefore impossible for them to 
</p>
<p>prepare their defence in adequate conditions, in contradiction with the principle of equality 
</p>
<p>of arms. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Translation and interpretation 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about reports that translations and 
</p>
<p>interpretation in court cases involving non-Arabic speakers, while prescribed by the law, 
</p>
<p>are not always provided in practice or that their quality is poor. She was alarmed to hear of 
</p>
<p>several cases where non-Arabic speaking defendants were forced to sign documents in 
</p>
<p>Arabic without being provided with a translation. These documents were later used against 
</p>
<p>them in court, and in one of the cases the document turned out to be a confession of guilt. 
</p>
<p>Several cases where the defendants were not provided with interpretation during court 
</p>
<p>hearings were also reported to the Special Rapporteur. Such obvious violations of due 
</p>
<p>process are unacceptable; moreover, any document or testimony given in the absence of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>translation or interpretation should have no legal validity. The Special Rapporteur notes 
</p>
<p>with appreciation that the Ministry of Justice prepared a draft law aiming at strengthening 
</p>
<p>the capacity and quality of translation services, including with regards to court matters. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Delays in proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>62. Another concern related to due process guarantees are delays in judicial proceedings 
</p>
<p>often caused by the postponement of hearings without clear and fair justification. For 
</p>
<p>instance, the appeal hearings in the Villagio case keep being postponed because the 
</p>
<p>defendants, sentenced to jail in first instance and under a travel ban, do not show up to court 
</p>
<p>when summoned. Such endless postponements are unacceptable. In one instance, the 
</p>
<p>absence of one of the defendants was justified by his travelling despite the travel ban 
</p>
<p>against him. Such disregard for a judicial decision is also a source of great concern to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. The result of the lack of due process followed in this case is to deny 
</p>
<p>victims their right to an effective remedy. It also robs them of the possibility to come to 
</p>
<p>closure with their loss. 
</p>
<p>63. Delays in court procedures can also have particular dire consequences on migrant 
</p>
<p>workers, who are in a particular vulnerable situation. Lengthy procedures in labour cases 
</p>
<p>more than often will leave migrant workers living in inhuman conditions. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was told that, since judges are often not sensitized to the particular situation of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers and their plight, the consequences of postponing or prolonging trials may 
</p>
<p>not be taken into account. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Access to justice and the situation of migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about access to justice of 
</p>
<p>vulnerable sectors of the population, such as migrant workers in the construction industry 
</p>
<p>or domestic workers, for whom obstacles to access justice in cases where their rights have 
</p>
<p>been violated seem to be almost insurmountable. In this context, it is important to note that 
</p>
<p>a system of sponsorship (or <i>Kafala</i>) is used in Qatar to regulate the relationship between 
</p>
<p>migrants and their employers. According to the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants, such system &#8220;enables unscrupulous employers to exploit employees&#8221;.6 
</p>
<p>65. Institutionalized legal aid is only available in criminal cases when the defendant 
</p>
<p>does not have the financial means to pay for a lawyer. The budget comes directly from the 
</p>
<p>courts&#8217; budget. Private actors, such as charity organizations, provide legal counselling, but 
</p>
<p>it is insufficient. The National Human Rights Committee also provides assistance to 
</p>
<p>migrant workers free of charge and, when necessary, can put them in contact with lawyers. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that a special office for labour disputes 
</p>
<p>created within the Ministry of Labour also provides information and quasi-legal support to 
</p>
<p>migrant workers free of charge. 
</p>
<p>66. Migrant workers, including domestic workers, face a series of serious obstacles to 
</p>
<p>access justice. Despite genuine and laudable efforts of both the authorities and the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee, the majority of migrant workers do not know how or where to 
</p>
<p>file a complaint. Language is also a barrier to getting adequate information and registering a 
</p>
<p>complaint. Migrant workers also very frequently fear the police, institutions and retaliation 
</p>
<p>from their employers. 
</p>
<p>67. Most importantly, migrant workers are unable to support themselves without an 
</p>
<p>income through the court process, which at best means they were suspended from their job.

</b></p>
<p>While a transfer of sponsorship to allow them to work for another employer is possible in 
</p>
<p>theory, such transfers are very rarely accepted in practice. Under the sponsorship system, 
</p>
<p>migrant workers cannot leave the country without the approval of their employer. 
</p>
<p>68. Finally, in the rare cases where migrant workers reach the courts, they have to pay 
</p>
<p>both court fees and expert fees. Court fees are requested to register a complaint, although in 
</p>
<p>labour cases migrant workers should be exempted. Expert fees have to be paid by the 
</p>
<p>complainant to obtain the expert financial report that is necessary to prove their case and 
</p>
<p>take it further in the judicial process. Expert fees can be as high as 600 Riyals 
</p>
<p>(approximately $165). Even in cases where the complaint is the same against the same 
</p>
<p>employer, each complainant has to pay the expert fees, which prevents migrant workers 
</p>
<p>from pooling money to present their cases collectively. Expert fees can reportedly be 
</p>
<p>waived, but it is rarely done in practice. Yet, one of the major grounds for complaints is the 
</p>
<p>non-payment of salaries. Courts need to be made aware of the plight of migrant workers 
</p>
<p>and the burden that these fees represent for them. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the administrative detention of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers. According to the sponsorship law, the detention of migrant workers 
</p>
<p>awaiting deportation can be ordered for up to 30 days, renewable. Lengthy periods of 
</p>
<p>administrative detention before deportation seem unnecessary to the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>and may amount to inhuman treatment; she wishes to note that the right not to be arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>detained also applies to migrant workers. In the case that migrant workers are detained 
</p>
<p>under criminal charges, all the safeguards against arbitrary detention should apply to them. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the announcements in May, July and November 
</p>
<p>2014 according to which reforms to improve the situation of migrant workers and replace 
</p>
<p>the <i>Kafala</i> with a system of contract between worker and employer would be announced in 
</p>
<p>early 2015. In addition to improving the working and living conditions of migrant workers 
</p>
<p>in Qatar, she hopes that the future reforms will also contribute to facilitating migrant 
</p>
<p>workers&#8217; access to justice. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Women in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>71. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur paid attention to the integration of a gender 
</p>
<p>perspective and women&#8217;s rights in the justice system. She is concerned about the poor 
</p>
<p>representation of women on the bench. According to numbers received, out of a total of 198 
</p>
<p>judges, only 2 are women (1 in the family circuit and 1 in the civil circuit) and 1 female 
</p>
<p>assistant judge out of 14. The Special Rapporteur was nevertheless encouraged to hear that 
</p>
<p>professors were encouraging more female law students to pursue a judicial career and that 
</p>
<p>more women were presenting their candidacies to become judges. 
</p>
<p>72. It seems that women, however, are still faced with institutionalized gender 
</p>
<p>discrimination at many stages of the justice system, including when filing complaints with 
</p>
<p>the police or appearing before the courts. Both the composition and behaviour of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and prosecution services seem to reflect the traditional and patriarchal societal 
</p>
<p>structure of the country. Gender biases and discriminatory attitudes and practices against 
</p>
<p>women are reproduced within the judiciary and the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>73. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that domestic and sexual 
</p>
<p>violence against women, in particular against female migrant domestic workers, is still 
</p>
<p>prevalent in Qatar.
7
 Women are subjected to strong social and institutional pressure and 
</p>
<p>stigma when trying to report cases of domestic and sexual violence. Such pressure and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 See CAT/C/QAT/CO/2, para. 19, and CEDAW/C/QAT/CO/1, para. 23. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>stigmatizing attitudes often prevent them from denouncing the violations they have 
</p>
<p>suffered, thereby representing a major obstacle to access justice. Migrant domestic workers 
</p>
<p>whose rights have been violated are in an extremely vulnerable position, as they have to 
</p>
<p>face compounded discrimination on the basis of their gender and their migrant status. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of statistical data on the number of complaints, 
</p>
<p>investigations, prosecutions and convictions in cases of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur firmly believes that a more representative and gender-
</p>
<p>sensitive judiciary can play a determining role in empowering women to gain access to 
</p>
<p>justice, claim their human rights and break patterns of discrimination and impunity for 
</p>
<p>cases of violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Prosecution services 
</b></p>
<p>75. The public prosecution was established as an independent judicial body by Law 
</p>
<p>No. 10 of 2002; it is headed by an Attorney-General, appointed by the Emir, and composed 
</p>
<p>of prosecutors of different ranks appointed by the Emir upon recommendation of the 
</p>
<p>Attorney-General. Prosecutors&#8217; security of tenure is guaranteed until the mandatory 
</p>
<p>retirement set forth by the law (70 years old). The Special Rapporteur is nevertheless 
</p>
<p>troubled by article 44(5) of Law No. 10 of 2002, according to which the Emir has 
</p>
<p>competence to dismiss prosecutors &#8220;for reasons of public interest&#8221;. In her view, such 
</p>
<p>ground for dismissal is vague and does not comply with international standards regarding 
</p>
<p>disciplinary measures against prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur was concerned to receive information according to which 
</p>
<p>the prosecution services were influenced by high-level persons or powerful businesses. For 
</p>
<p>this reason, a clear distinction must be drawn between public and State interests. Acting on 
</p>
<p>behalf of the public interest should not be confused with protecting the interests of the 
</p>
<p>Government or any other State institution. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was also particularly concerned to hear allegations about the 
</p>
<p>complicity of prosecution services in the fabrication of facts or tempering of evidence in 
</p>
<p>certain cases. The prosecution office also seems to have complete discretion when it comes 
</p>
<p>to the cases it takes up or not. This has led to irrational instances where the prosecution was 
</p>
<p>pursued even when the evidence pointed to the fact that no crime had been committed. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is further troubled by the reported lack of judicial oversight of the work 
</p>
<p>of prosecutors. Judicial oversight is important to ensure the legality of the actions of the 
</p>
<p>prosecution, whether during the investigative or trial phases. Finally, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur must underline the absence of clear guidelines of procedure and of a written 
</p>
<p>code of conduct or ethics as a serious deficit, which may jeopardize the impartiality and 
</p>
<p>independence of prosecutors, as well as the quality and consistency of their work. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>78. Like judges and prosecutors, lawyers also play an essential role in ensuring the 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary and upholding the rule of law and, while they are not 
</p>
<p>expected to be impartial in the same way as judges, they must be free from external 
</p>
<p>pressures and interference. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the absence of an 
</p>
<p>independent self-regulating bar association that oversees the process of admitting 
</p>
<p>candidates to the legal profession, provides for a uniform code of ethics and conduct and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>enforces disciplinary measures, including disbarment.
8
 The establishment of such an 
</p>
<p>organized legal profession is a key element to the independence of lawyers.  
</p>
<p>79. The conditions of admission to the bar are set out in article 23 of Law No. 23 and 
</p>
<p>include six months of compulsory training at the Centre for Judicial and Legal Studies and 
</p>
<p>18 months of training at a law firm. While at the time of the visit no uniform written bar 
</p>
<p>examination was in place, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment at the end of 
</p>
<p>2014 of such an examination, which she hopes will contribute to addressing the current 
</p>
<p>unequal competence between lawyers. 
</p>
<p>80. The Lawyers&#8217; Admission Committee established in the Ministry of Justice is in 
</p>
<p>charge of the admission of lawyers and their registration in one of the rolls set forth by the 
</p>
<p>law.
9
 Its decisions can be appealed before the Court of Appeal. While she acknowledges the 
</p>
<p>presence of three lawyers in the Committee, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the 
</p>
<p>extensive involvement of the executive in the admission and registration of lawyers, which, 
</p>
<p>in her view, is incompatible with the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers as it 
</p>
<p>undermines lawyers&#8217; independence. She also notes with concerns that an application of 
</p>
<p>enrolment renewal has to be submitted by practicing lawyers every year. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes with appreciation that a draft law was prepared by the Ministry of Justice 
</p>
<p>to modify the composition of the Committee and hopes to receive more information on its 
</p>
<p>content. 
</p>
<p>81. In the same vein, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the implication of the 
</p>
<p>executive branch in disciplinary procedures against and the disbarment of lawyers. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>the Department of Legal Advice and Contracts at the Ministry of Justice receives and 
</p>
<p>investigates disciplinary complaints against lawyers. If evidence of misbehaviour is found, 
</p>
<p>the Department presents a disciplinary claim before the Disciplinary Board,
10
</p>
<p> which will 
</p>
<p>consider the case and make a decision. Decisions can be challenged before the Court of 
</p>
<p>Appeal. Lawyers&#8217; rights and duties are listed in Law No. 23 of 2006, but at the time of the 
</p>
<p>visit there was no comprehensive code of conduct or ethics that clearly defines what 
</p>
<p>constitutes an infraction and how such infractions are sanctioned. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes information according to which the association of lawyers is preparing a draft 
</p>
<p>code of conduct to present to the Admission Committee. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur was further concerned to hear about the difficulties that 
</p>
<p>lawyers have had in discharging their professional functions, in particular regarding access 
</p>
<p>to information, including expert reports and other essential documents, and the case file of 
</p>
<p>their client during both investigation and trial phases. The Special Rapporteur also heard 
</p>
<p>reports of lawyers being arbitrarily banned from entering court hearings where they were to 
</p>
<p>represent a client or arbitrarily replaced by another lawyer upon order of the court and 
</p>
<p>against the will of their client. She is also worried that some Qatari lawyers were reported 
</p>
<p>to behave in a discriminatory way in front of non-Qatari judges, without being sanctioned. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 There is an association of lawyers but it has no official competence. 
</p>
<p> 9 The Lawyers&#8217; Admission Committee is composed of three representatives of the Ministry of Justice 
</p>
<p>(including the Minister himself), two judges from the Court of Appeal, a public prosecutor and three 
</p>
<p>lawyers elected by the Minister of Justice. 
</p>
<p> 10 The Disciplinary Board is composed of one judge from the Court of Appeal, two judges selected by 
</p>
<p>the President of the Court of Cassation, one jurist from the Ministry of Justice and one lawyer 
</p>
<p>admitted before the Court of Cassation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Education, training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>83. All stakeholders met during the visit were unanimous in recognizing the importance 
</p>
<p>of high-quality education and professional training for judges, prosecutors and lawyers in 
</p>
<p>order to ensure an independent, impartial and effective administration of justice; they also 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the current deficits of Qatar in this domain and the efforts of the authorities 
</p>
<p>in pursuing avenues to remedy the situation. The lack of continuing or on-the-job training 
</p>
<p>was also underlined. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the urgent need to further strengthen 
</p>
<p>training in international law, in particular human rights law and the conventions and treaties 
</p>
<p>ratified by Qatar. In one particular case, a lawyer made references to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child in his pleadings, which were ignored by the judge, who had never heard 
</p>
<p>of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>85. Qatar has a faculty of law and a faculty of sharia. There are also campuses of several 
</p>
<p>international universities, and the authorities have set up study programmes in European 
</p>
<p>and American universities to stimulate enrolment in legal studies. For instance, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was told that staff members of the Ministry of Justice are encouraged and 
</p>
<p>offered specific opportunities to study abroad. There is also the Centre for Legal and 
</p>
<p>Judicial Studies, which was established by Law No. 8 of 2001 (amended) as a separate legal 
</p>
<p>entity under the authority of the Ministry of Justice to provide training for judges, 
</p>
<p>prosecutors, legal assistants, law enforcement officers and lawyers. The National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee has also provided specific training to future judges and prosecutors, and 
</p>
<p>that practice should be further encouraged. 
</p>
<p>86. The authorities seem particularly aware that efforts are urgently needed to continue 
</p>
<p>to build education and training capacities in Qatar in order to improve the expertise of 
</p>
<p>judges, prosecutors and lawyers and the quality of their work. In this context, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes innovative initiatives like the &#8220;Development of Professional Legal 
</p>
<p>and Judicial Education in Qatar&#8221;, led by the Qatar International Court and Dispute 
</p>
<p>Resolution Centre. This initiative aims at establishing an International Judicial and Legal 
</p>
<p>Education Institute in Qatar, thereby creating a system of professional legal and judicial 
</p>
<p>education that works to international standards and is tailor-made for the development of 
</p>
<p>Qatari judges, prosecutors and lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Qatar has come a long way in a short time in terms of developing its justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system. The country's recent dramatic population growth has put pressure on its 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, which will need to adapt and promote reforms in order to be able to deal 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the challenges that will continue to arise with the influx of foreigners and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country's tremendous ongoing economic development.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the recognition of the principle of 
</b></p>
<p><b>separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary in the Constitution. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledgement of these principles, which are essential to the rule of law, was 
</b></p>
<p><b>indispensable to provide for a healthy foundation upon which to build a new judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>system in line with the international principles of independence and impartiality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees of due process and fair trial. The unification of the courts under Law 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 10 of 2003 also constituted a welcome development that largely contributed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consolidating the administration of justice in Qatar. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>In spite of such progress, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges and shortcomings she identified in the present report negatively affect the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence and impartiality of the justice system, as well as the enjoyment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in Qatar. Some of the cases mentioned in the report as way of examples 
</b></p>
<p><b>are seriously worrying; they tarnish the genuine efforts undertaken by many to set up 
</b></p>
<p><b>a justice system that is independent, impartial and competent in Qatar. Cases should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be given all the attention they deserve, and violations of due process remedied as soon 
</b></p>
<p><b>as possible to provide for positive examples and guide the improvements needed. If 
</b></p>
<p><b>left unaddressed, these challenges and shortcomings will also undermine positive 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The authorities have assured the Special Rapporteur of their determination to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve the system where needed. Qatar shows great potential in this sense as, unlike 
</b></p>
<p><b>many other countries, Qatar has the financial means to support reforms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement a wide range of measures. Ten years after the adoption of the Permanent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution, Qatar should not miss the opportunity to launch the reforms necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>to reinforce its institutions, in particular those related to the justice system. Against 
</b></p>
<p><b>this background, the Special Rapporteur strongly encourages Qatar to continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>engage with all human rights mechanisms and to spare no efforts in implementing 
</b></p>
<p><b>their recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocols should be ratified. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Supreme Constitutional Court should be formed and be provided with all 
</b></p>
<p><b>the resources and guarantees necessary for its full independence and proper 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration so as to become operational as soon as possible. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Free and fair elections to the Advisory Council should be held in conformity 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the provisions of the Constitution of Qatar; women should be encouraged to run. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Limitations to the competence of the courts, including regarding nationality-
</b></p>
<p><b>related issues, should be removed as the courts should have jurisdiction over all issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>of a judicial nature. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Measures should be taken to guarantee the independence of the judiciary. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, alleged cases of improper influences, pressures, threats and interferences, 
</b></p>
<p><b>direct or indirect, should be promptly investigated and, if confirmed, perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be held accountable. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The appointment mechanism should be reviewed to limit the involvement of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>executive. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Clear, objective and transparent criteria should be applied in the selection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges, so as to ensure that such selection be based on merit only. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Article 63(5) of Law 10 of 2003 should be amended. All disciplinary measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken against judges should be in line with international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Complaints related to discriminatory attitudes and other improper behaviour 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the judiciary should be promptly investigated and, if necessary, appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures should be taken. </b></p>

<p><b>  Non-national judges 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b> Non-Qatari judges should be provided with all the guarantees given to national 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges, as long as these are in line with the rules of secondment of their home country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Their contracts should not have to be renewed annually, but rather they should last 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the whole duration of the secondment allowed by the home country. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>A transparent and clear strategy, accompanied by a sufficiently resourced 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme, should be adopted to progressively reduce the number of non-Qatari 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges in full conformity with international human rights obligations; in the longer 
</b></p>
<p><b>term, the goal should be to fully nationalize membership of the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b> Lawyers, prosecutors and other stakeholders should show the same level of 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect to non-Qatari judges as shown to national judges. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Accountability and disciplinary measures 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>A written code of conduct or ethics for judges should be adopted in line with

<p><b>  Fair trial, due process and administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Code of Criminal Procedure should be amended to prescribe a limit for

</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Laws on the Protection of the Community, on Combating Terrorism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing the State Security Service should be amended in line with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>and domestic safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention. Activities prohibited

<p>110. <b>Quality interpretation and translation for non-Arabic speakers should be

</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Policies, procedures and practices to promote equal access to justice for all, in

</b></p>
<p><b>  Women in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Gender-based bias, stereotypes and discrimination persisting in the justice
