<p>1. In its resolution 15/24 on human rights and unilateral coercive measures, the Human 
Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to prepare a thematic study on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the 
enjoyment of human rights, including recommendations on actions aimed at ending such 
measures, taking into account all previous reports, resolutions and relevant information 
available to the United Nations system in this regard, and to present the study to the 
Council at its eighteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The above-mentioned study is under preparation and will require additional time for 
its completion. The study therefore will be submitted to the Human Rights Council at its 
nineteenth session.
