to protect the environment, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the decision to organize, in 2012, the United Nations Conference on

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that good governance, within each country and at the international 
level, is essential for sustainable development, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
development and that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet the 
development and environmental needs of present and future generations,

direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights,

around the world, environmental damage is felt most acutely by those segments of the 
population who are already in vulnerable situations,

character and that effective international cooperation to address such damage is important 
in order to support national efforts for the realization of human rights,
