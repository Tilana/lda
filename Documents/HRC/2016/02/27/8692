</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Guinea-Bissau was held at the 9th meeting, on 7 May 2010. The delegation 
of Guinea-Bissau was headed by the Minister of Justice, Mamadu Saliu Jalo Pires. At its 
13th meeting, held on 11 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on Guinea-
Bissau. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guinea-Bissau: Djibouti, the United States of 
America and the Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Guinea-Bissau: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/GBN/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GBN/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/GBN/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, 
Slovenia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Germany, Norway 
and the Netherlands was transmitted to Guinea-Bissau through the troika. Those questions 
are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the ninth meeting, held on 7 May 2010, His Excellency Mr. Mamadu Saliu Jalo 
Pires, Minister of Justice, explained that Guinea-Bissau had gained independence in 1974 
following an armed struggle for national liberation during which the African Party for the 
Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde had formed its own army, which had 
subsequently become the national armed forces. 
</p>
<p>6. In the 1990s, the country had started to build a multiparty democracy, the aim being 
to construct a democratic State governed by the rule of law. To this end, it had revised its 
Constitution to incorporate the principle of separation of powers, respect for the dignity of 
the human person, and respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sex, religion or economic, social 
or political status is enshrined in the Constitution. Men and women are equal before the 
law, and the fundamental rights of all citizens of Guinea-Bissau are safeguarded by the 
domestic legal order. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation explained, however, that the country&#8217;s recent history, particularly in 
the last decade, had been a very difficult period for its people owing to a series of political 
and military crises that had resulted in serious violence against individual citizens, many of 
them in prominent political or military positions. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-14446 
</p>
<p>9. Despite these enormous difficulties, the Government had embarked on an extensive 
programme of reform of the defence and security forces, the aim being to ensure their 
modernization and essentially Republican nature while eradicating the violence that has 
characterized the country over the past 11&#8211;12 years, seriously damaging Guinea Bissau&#8217;s 
image both at home and abroad. The reform envisages a significant reduction in the military 
ranks and, as a consequence, improved living conditions in barracks.  
</p>
<p>10. Human rights have always been one of the Government&#8217;s primary concerns. Its 
policy programme therefore includes specific actions to help guarantee respect for human 
rights and fight impunity in a proactive manner.  
</p>
<p>11. Guinea-Bissau is not yet a party to the Convention against Torture. However, it had 
signed the Convention and will be taking the action necessary for its prompt ratification. 
The country is also not yet a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, but is bound by other international legal instruments that prohibit torture and cruel 
and inhuman treatment, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights. Torture is also prohibited under the Constitution of Guinea-Bissau. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation indicated that the Government of Guinea-Bissau will always be 
ready to cooperate with the human rights mechanisms and has invited the Special 
Rapporteurs to visit the country to form their own opinion of the human rights situation in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation recalled the tragic events that Guinea-Bissau had witnessed on 1 and 
2 March and 5 June 2009, resulting in the assassination of the President of the Republic, the 
Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the former Minister of Administration and the former 
Minister of Defence. The international community has demanded that all the killings should 
be investigated and that those responsible be brought to justice. The Government shares this 
desire. 
</p>
<p>14. A new shadow was cast over the image of Guinea-Bissau, on 1 April 2010, when in 
a further illegal and anti-constitutional military intervention, the Prime Minister was 
kidnapped and Vice-Admiral Jos&#233; Zamora Induta was unlawfully detained. These events 
created an extremely disturbing situation for the Government, the Parliament and the 
President of the Republic. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government has placed all available resources at the disposal of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to enable it to carry out the required investigations into the events of 1 
and 2 March and 5 June 2009, with the support of the judicial police, pursuant to the terms 
of the Constitution and criminal legislation. 
</p>
<p>16. On the request of the Prosecutor-General, the Government has solicited financial 
assistance from the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau to cover 
the cost of the inquiries into the assassination of President Jo&#227;o Bernardo Vieira, given that 
the principal witnesses are currently overseas, specifically in Belgium, France and Senegal. 
Despite all these obstacles, the Prosecutor-General has informed the Government that the 
investigations into the events of 1 and 2 March and 5 June 2009 are progressing.  
</p>
<p>17. On the President&#8217;s initiative, the Government, military leaders, members of 
parliament, political parties, civil society and former soldiers are currently engaged in an 
intensive political consultation process, to discover how best to put an end to the succession 
of crises afflicting the country, which is the only way the Government will be free to 
exercise its constitutional powers and guarantee the military&#8217;s subordination to the political 
authorities, this being a prerequisite for cementing the rule of law in Guinea-Bissau. 
Domestic political and judicial institutions need to be strengthened and the army 
restructured if the country is to be modernized and lasting peace and stability secured. </p>


<p>GE.10-14446 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>18. The illegal detention of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Jos&#233; Zamora Induta, 
and the kidnapping of the Prime Minister on 1 April 2010 are also currently under 
investigation by the Prosecutor-General. 
</p>
<p>19. Concerns about the arbitrary arrests and illegal detentions are intricately linked to 
the country&#8217;s fragile political situation, which the President and his Government are 
attempting to resolve through inclusive political dialogue. If it is to be effective in the fight 
against impunity and in the prevention of the political-military crises destabilizing the 
country, the Government needs to successfully implement its programme of defence and 
security sector reforms, as well as the reforms of the justice sector. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 32 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations recognized the difficulties facing Guinea-Bissau as a consequence of periods of 
conflict and political and institutional instability. Recommendations made during the 
dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>21. Algeria noted that since its independence, Guinea-Bissau had been living in political 
instability and extreme poverty, with all of the negative consequences for the enjoyment of 
human rights by a large sector of the population. It noted with interest the measures taken 
with respect to good governance, combating drug trafficking, convening the conference on 
national reconciliation and the creation of conditions favourable for a lasting peace, security 
and political stability in the country. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Brazil recalled that long-standing political and social turbulence had been obstacles 
to the establishment of minimum conditions for economic development and democracy in 
Guinea-Bissau. It welcomed the establishment of a Ministry of Women. High levels of 
poverty and hunger, low literacy levels and an unstable rule of law and security system 
were at the core of the challenges faced by the country. Despite this, institution-building 
had been developing consistently until disrupted by a failed coup in April. Brazil 
considered that improvement in the area of human rights required a bold commitment on 
the part of the Government and the people. It also depended on the support of the 
international community to overcome the root causes of human rights violations. Brazil 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Canada welcomed the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission in 
October 2008, which would have an important role to play in the promotion and protection 
of human rights in Guinea-Bissau. Acknowledging recent reports regarding the interference 
of the military power in political affairs, Canada noted the Government&#8217;s willingness and 
progress in the establishment of commissions of inquiry to investigate the killings of March 
</p><p>2009. Canada was concerned about reports of increasing cases of female genital mutilation 
and noted the absence of detailed plans for combating all forms of violence against women 
and girls. Canada made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>24. Nigeria commended Guinea-Bissau for having ratified a number of the core 
international human rights instruments, which was a demonstration of its willingness to 
engage with the international community. It recognized that Guinea-Bissau was facing 
enormous challenges in fulfilling its commitments related to the promotion and protection 
of human rights, particularly with regard to health, education, the burden of long-standing 
traditions, external debt, the fact that it was a transit point for drug trafficking, and the 
condition of infrastructure. Nigeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Indonesia expressed satisfaction at the establishment of the National Commission 
for Human Rights in October 2008. It also appreciated the frankness of the national report 
in outlining shortcomings in the implementation of human rights. Indonesia noted that </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-14446 
</p>
<p>poverty, a lack of modern infrastructure and funding, a low literacy rate and rampant 
corruption were all obstacles to the effective promotion and protection of human rights and 
to development in the country. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. France noted that the national report emphasized a lack of civil control over the 
armed forces, as shown by the impunity of members of the military found guilty of murder 
and other human rights violations. It asked about the measures planned by Guinea-Bissau to 
identify and prosecute the military personnel responsible for such crimes and to re-establish 
discipline within the armed forces. It noted the scale of discrimination and violence against 
women and girls and that early marriage, female genital mutilation and domestic violence 
remained common practices, exacerbated by the very high illiteracy rate for women. France 
expressed concern about the massive development of a certain form of forced labour carried 
out by children called Talib&#233;s. It asked about measures planned by Guinea-Bissau in that 
regard. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Egypt noted that priorities outlined in the national report included achieving peace, 
stability and development. It also noted that emphasis had been placed on the rights of 
vulnerable groups and that a number of strategies had been put in place in the field of 
economic, social and cultural rights. Egypt called on the international community to extend 
the necessary assistance to Guinea-Bissau so that it could fulfil its obligations related to the 
promotion of human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Cuba stated that Guinea-Bissau was a country that was affected by poverty but 
working for the social and economic development of its society in a global context rife with 
crisis. Cuba noted several initiatives such as the Health Development Plan; the Strategic 
Plan against HIV/AIDS; the fight against illiteracy, which was one of the Government&#8217;s 
priorities; and free education. Cooperation and financial technical assistance should be 
provided by developed countries, especially as a way to further promote the Government&#8217;s 
programmes in the field of human rights. Cuba made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>29. Spain welcomed the establishment of the National Commission for Reconciliation 
and the Commission of Inquiry to investigate the events of March 2009. It highlighted the 
fact that Guinea-Bissau prohibited the death penalty for all crimes, and supported its 
determination to put an end to the interference of the military power in the judiciary. It 
welcomed the decision of Guinea-Bissau to adopt specific legislation against female genital 
mutilation. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Mexico recognized efforts made by Guinea-Bissau to promote human rights, 
highlighting in particular collaboration with regional and international organs to reinforce 
its capacity in that area. It noted with appreciation the country&#8217;s abolition of the death 
penalty, the recent holding of democratic elections and efforts to reduce child mortality. 
Mexico recognized the serious challenges faced by the country and expressed the hope that 
efforts to end impunity would lead to political stability and peace. Mexico made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>31. Hungary stated that the effective implementation of existing human rights 
obligations, such as children&#8217;s rights and non-discrimination against women, should also be 
accorded priority and that the Government might consider requesting technical and 
capacity-building assistance in meeting those obligations. It emphasized that international 
cooperation should not be a substitute for States&#8217; primary responsibility for the promotion 
and protection of human rights. Hungary made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. South Africa was mindful of the challenges to be overcome in order to achieve 
security, political stability and the restoration of constitutional order. It emphasized the 
importance of effective policies and governmental institutions. It noted efforts aimed at the 
consolidation of peace, as well as challenges, particularly in the areas related to combating 
HIV/AIDS, high infant and maternal mortality rates, the absence of legislation prohibiting </p>


<p>GE.10-14446 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the trafficking in persons, access to education and health facilities, and the provision of 
clean water and electricity. It expressed concern about the ongoing discrimination against 
women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Poland welcomed steps taken to combat the trafficking in persons, especially 
children. However, it noted that UNICEF had highlighted in its 2009 report an increase in 
drug trafficking that placed children at risk. It asked what steps had been taken to prevent 
children from being involved in drug trafficking. Poland also asked what measures would 
be taken to implement legislation providing for the application of the juvenile justice 
infrastructure and system in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Germany noted the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child about the 
trafficking in women and children, and asked about measures taken in that regard. It noted 
reports of complaints about pressure and intimidation directed at journalists covering drug 
trafficking, and reports of random cases involving harassment of the press. Germany also 
mentioned the fact that State television was becoming increasingly biased in terms of news 
reporting and asked how Guinea-Bissau was improving respect for freedom of expression 
and freedom of the press. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Morocco stated that a careful examination of Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s national report had 
revealed the open-minded and brave approach of the Guinean authorities in defining a true 
balance between efforts made and self-criticism regarding current constraints. This sincere 
engagement vis-&#224;-vis the universal periodic review mechanism was an example of good 
practice that deserved further encouragement. Among other achievements, Morocco noted 
the establishment of the Children&#8217;s National Parliament, a children&#8217;s forum for the 
discussion of issues related to the lives of children and young people in the country. 
Morocco made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Israel encouraged Guinea-Bissau to continue its cooperation with the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Support Office, in particular with the OHCHR human rights component. It 
stated that it remained ready to work with Guinea-Bissau and committed itself to providing 
assistance in the areas of combating poverty and empowerment of women and in the fields 
of health, agriculture and education. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>37. Argentina made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>38. Angola stated that it was closely following efforts made by Guinea-Bissau to bring 
political stability to the country, which was a precondition for guaranteeing the basic rights 
of its people. It considered that, although much had been done, much still needed to be 
done. Angola asked what steps had been taken to reinforce the judicial system, which had 
been identified as one of the weakest branches of the State. It made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. Norway recognized the economic, social and political challenges facing Guinea-
Bissau as a result of periods of conflict and political and institutional instability. Bearing in 
mind that the unstable political situation had also had an impact on Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s 
difficulties in preparing for and ratifying various human rights conventions and protocols, 
Norway appreciated the work that Guinea-Bissau had carried out on the Optional Protocol 
to CEDAW in 2009. Norway expressed concerns regarding, inter alia, the situation of 
human rights defenders, individuals criticizing drug traffickers and the national army, and 
the situation of women. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Netherlands noted that the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women was concerned at the absence of a definition of discrimination in the 
Constitution and in legislation and requested information about the progress made in that 
area. It noted the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Rights of the Child about the </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14446 
</p>
<p>poor respect for the rights of children with disabilities and the social discrimination 
prevalent against them. It also noted the recommendation made by the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child regarding the development or amendment of legislation to ensure that 
discrimination on the grounds of disability was prohibited. The Netherlands referred to the 
2009 condemnation by the Security Council of cases of arbitrary detention, armed attack 
and intimidation. It asked about the follow-up given to the recommendations set out in the 
report of the Secretary-General on the conditions of detention. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed Guinea- 
Bissau&#8217;s intention to extend an invitation to special procedures and noted that the well-
organized elections in June and July 2009 had allowed people to express their choice of 
President. However, given the events of April 2010, the United Kingdom was concerned 
that the political situation remained fragile and asked what steps the Government was 
taking to ensure that security and military personnel understood their obligation to respect 
and protect human rights. The United Kingdom made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>42. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya took note of the efforts made by Guinea-Bissau to 
promote and protect human rights. While noting that Africans were most affected by racial 
discrimination because of injustices perpetrated during the colonization, it called upon 
colonial States to live up to their responsibilities through compensation, reparation and 
public apologies. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. China expressed appreciation for efforts made by the Government to promote human 
rights. It also expressed understanding of the special situation in the country and the hope 
that the various parties would exercise restraint, focus on national unity and stability, and 
resolve their disputes through dialogue and consultation in order to restore order, so as to 
better protect human rights. China made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>44. Slovenia was pleased to note that the Constitution of Guinea-Bissau guaranteed 
fundamental human rights and freedoms and allowed for the automatic application of 
international fundamental rights and norms. It asked the Government of Guinea-Bissau 
about the prospect of ratifying the human rights treaties that it had signed. Slovenia 
commended the Government for having adopted the Plan of Action of the first phase of the 
World Programme for Human Rights Education, focusing on national school systems, and 
encouraged it to continue to devote considerable attention to human rights education. 
Slovenia welcomed the Government&#8217;s determination to strive for national reconciliation 
and to combat impunity. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. In response to delegations&#8217; questions, Guinea-Bissau noted with satisfaction that the 
vast majority of countries recognized that it was facing considerable obstacles to the 
establishment of the conditions required for credible and stable governance.   
</p>
<p>46. As to the ratification of international instruments, the delegation of Guinea-Bissau 
indicated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would, if necessary, request technical 
assistance to that end so that the Government could promptly begin the process of 
ratification of the human rights instruments it had signed. 
</p>
<p>47. The Guinea-Bissau authorities recognize the importance of reducing poverty, given 
its significant impact on the enjoyment of various human rights. The fragility of some 
institutions is essentially due to the lack of training for public officials, but corruption is 
also a factor. The Government is committed to fighting poverty in all its forms in order to 
guarantee the population&#8217;s basic human rights. A series of programmes and bodies have 
already been established to this end, including a dedicated ministry charged with fighting 
poverty and eradicating gender-related inequalities. Guinea-Bissau is also committed to 
reducing maternal and infant mortality rates through a programme piloted by the Ministry 
of Health. However, political stability and the support of the international community are 
vital if all these programmes are to succeed.  </p>


<p>GE.10-14446 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>48. Children, and children with disabilities in particular, are protected under the 
provisions of the Criminal Code and through the work of specific institutions attached 
either to the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry responsible for the protection of the family. 
Responsibility for implementing all protection and development programmes for women 
and children falls to the Institute for Women and Children. 
</p>
<p>49. Women&#8217;s rights are guaranteed under the Constitution, but the Government of 
Guinea-Bissau firmly believes that more must be done to ensure that their rights are 
effectively respected throughout the country. A bill to criminalize female genital mutilation 
and put an end to this reprehensible practice is currently in the preparatory stages and will 
be submitted to Parliament in the near future. The Ministry of Justice is also overseeing the 
implementation of an extensive programme of reforms designed to enhance human rights 
protection and promote equality. Guinea-Bissau is counting on the support of the 
international community for implementing these reforms of the normative framework for 
human rights protection. Additionally, since the country lacks an effective prison system, 
i.e. prisons operated directly by the Ministry of Justice subject to clear legislation governing 
prison management, a UNDP-backed prison reform programme entailing devising adequate 
legislation, renovating prison facilities, and training prison staff is currently under way. 
</p>
<p>50. Drafts legislation to combat trafficking in human beings, in particular trafficking in 
women and children, is in the preparatory stages and will shortly be brought before 
Parliament. In the case of Talib&#233; children in particular, the Government is tackling the 
problem, in conjunction with national and international non-governmental organizations 
working in the field. A specific law will also be drawn up, and a cooperation agreement 
signed with neighbouring countries, given that many Talib&#233; children are sent across the 
border and made to beg on the streets.   
</p>
<p>51. Peace and political stability are vital prerequisites for Guinea-Bissau; to that end, a 
national conference in which all political stakeholders are involved is currently in the 
planning stages. 
</p>
<p>52. Slovakia noted the difficulties that Guinea-Bissau had been facing as a consequence 
of the armed conflict, political instability and extreme poverty. It commended the adoption 
of the plan of action focusing on the national school system. Slovakia noted reports of 
torture and other inhuman treatment, including arbitrary arrests and detention carried out by 
military personnel, particularly against political opponents. Slovakia referred to the 
concerns expressed by the Secretary-General in 2008 about the situation in detention 
centres. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The United States of America denounced the kidnapping and detention, on 1 April 
2010, of the Prime Minister, the Chief of Defence and others by rogue elements of the 
military. It called for the unconditional release of those still being held illegally and for the 
armed forces to respect civilian control of the military. The United States also remained 
deeply concerned by the assassination, in March 2009, of former President Vieira and the 
former armed forces Chief of Staff, and the assassination, in June 2009, of a member of 
Parliament and a presidential candidate. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Latvia noted that there were still pending requests by two special procedures 
mandate holders to visit Guinea-Bissau. It made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55. Senegal stated that Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s participation in the universal periodic review 
was a reason for great pride and had provided it with an opportunity to confirm its support 
for the country&#8217;s development efforts. It considered that, more than ever, assistance in all 
areas was necessary in order to help Guinea-Bissau overcome the multiple challenges 
facing it, as the country was striving to make a new beginning. Senegal reaffirmed its 
solidarity with the sister nation of Guinea-Bissau. It made recommendations.  </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-14446 
</p>
<p>56. Mozambique noted that Guinea-Bissau was a country with a vibrant civil society 
that actively participated in the promotion and protection of human rights and garnered 
strength because individual freedoms and liberties such as freedom of expression, 
association and the press enjoyed constitutional protection. Mozambique noted that Guinea-
Bissau was a democracy in which there was no capital punishment and whose Constitution 
outlawed torture. Mozambique made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted that Guinea-Bissau tackled the AIDS 
pandemic, protected freedom of religion and remained a country of hospitability, regularly 
taking in a considerable number of refugees. It highlighted the many socio-economic 
problems facing Guinea-Bissau, citing the public insecurity undermining the right to life, 
female genital mutilation, forced marriage, the trafficking in human beings, insufficient 
support for children, food insecurity and the lack of health infrastructure. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Bangladesh welcomed achievements in the areas of health and primary education. It 
expressed appreciation for the adoption of a national plan to combat HIV/AIDS and for 
steps taken to combat trafficking. It also expressed its understanding of the multiple 
challenges faced by the country, many of which had been aggravated by the political 
volatility and armed conflict. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. The Philippines stated that it understood the complex challenges facing Guinea-
Bissau, particularly the continuing need to combat poverty, which had had a severe impact 
on the promotion of human rights; the need to improve the rule of law; and the need to 
address the security and political situation in a resolute manner and in a spirit of inclusive 
national dialogue and reconciliation. The Philippines highlighted the role of the 
international community in assisting Guinea-Bissau and congratulated its Government on 
having adopted the Plan of Action of the first phase of the World Programme for Human 
Rights Education. The Philippines made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. Guinea-Bissau emphasized that it was important for the international community to 
realize that, without its support, the country would remain trapped in a vicious circle. There 
were now three vital matters for Guinea-Bissau: firstly, a high-level international 
conference scheduled to take place in New York in June 2010 to engage the assistance of 
international partners in implementing the programme of defence and security sector 
reforms.  
</p>
<p>61. In addition to this high-level conference, the Government is planning a round table 
for October or November 2010 at which it will present its growth and poverty-reduction 
programme to the international community, with the aim of securing the international 
assistance and support necessary to set the country on the path to sustainable development.   
</p>
<p>62. The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund is due to conduct a mid-
term review of Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s programme. However, the programme&#8217;s timeliness and 
pertinence have already been proven by its direct impact on the Government&#8217;s capacity and 
resources to effectively combat poverty and create conditions conducive to economic 
growth.  
</p>
<p>63. In its concluding remarks, Guinea-Bissau reiterated its standing invitation to Special 
Rapporteurs to visit the country and form their own opinion of the human rights situation 
on the ground. In so doing they would also have the opportunity to evaluate the 
Government&#8217;s efforts and the country&#8217;s need of support from the international community 
in the implementation of all the reform programmes under way.   
</p>
<p>64. Guinea-Bissau gave assurances that any recommendations would be given due 
consideration and would be of great help to its domestic authorities and institutions in their 
efforts to promote and protect human rights in the country. </p>
