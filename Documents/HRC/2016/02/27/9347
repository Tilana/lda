<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, in 
which the Council decided to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue 
with the fulfilment of [her] activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. The present report 
outlines progress achieved since the last report on the accreditation of national human rights 
institutions to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/92) and should be read in conjunction with 
the report of the Secretary-General on national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (A/HRC/7/69) which includes, inter alia, information on ways and means of 
enhancing participation of NHRIs in the work of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  SUB-COMMITTEE ON ACCREDITATION 
</b></p>
<p>2. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the International Coordination Committee of 
National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC), the 
Sub-Committee on Accreditation has the mandate to review and analyse accreditation 
applications forwarded by the ICC Chairperson and to make recommendations to ICC members 
on the compliance of applicants with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>3. For the purpose of ensuring a fair balance of regional representation on the Sub-Committee 
on Accreditation, it is composed of one &#8220;A status&#8221; accredited NHRI for each of the four regional 
groupings, as established by the ICC rules of procedure, namely Africa, the Americas, Asia and 
the Pacific, and Europe. Members of the Sub-Committee are appointed by regional groupings for 
a renewable term of two years. The Sub-Committee on Accreditation designates by consensus, 
for a renewable term of two years, one of its members to act as the Chair of the Sub-Committee. 
As of December 2007, the ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation is composed of representatives 
of the NHRIs of Canada (Chair) for the Americas; Rwanda for Africa; the Republic of Korea for 
Asia and the Pacific; and Germany for Europe. OHCHR participates as a permanent observer 
and in its capacity as ICC secretariat.  
</p>
<p>4. The Sub-Committee convened on 19-20 March 2007 and considered applications for 
re-accreditation from Bolivia, Indonesia, Malawi, Peru, the Philippines and Portugal. 
Applications for re-accreditation were deferred for NHRIs from Fiji, France, Honduras, Nigeria, 
Poland and Sweden. The Sub-Committee also considered new applications for accreditation 
from Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Jordan, Puerto Rico and Romania. Finally, the Sub-Committee 
undertook a review of the accreditation status of the national institutions of Fiji and Nepal, and 
considered information relating to the NHRIs of Nigeria and Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>5. The Sub-Committee convened from 22-26 October 2007 and considered applications for 
re-accreditation from Colombia, Denmark, France, Greece, Honduras, Jordan, Morocco, 
Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Spain and Togo. The 
circumstances of Sweden were also considered. The Sub-Committee also considered new 
applications from Afghanistan, Georgia and Slovakia, and undertook a review of the 
accreditation status of the NHRIs of Nepal, Nigeria and Sri Lanka. The national human rights 
institution of Germany was elected as Chair at the following session.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. The table reflecting the accreditation status of NHRIs as of December 2007 is attached in 
annex I. The Sub-Committee also acknowledged the high degree of support and professionalism 
of the staff of the ICC secretariat (OHCHR, National Institutions Unit).  
</p>
<p><b>II.  IMPROVEMENT OF THE ICC ACCREDITATION PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p>7. At the seventeenth session of its annual meeting, held on 12 April 2006, ICC established a 
Working Group to examine the process used to accredit NHRIs and to develop a discussion 
paper for the ICC on the matter. The working group, whose members were also the members of 
the ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation at the time, developed a discussion paper examining 
three areas: (a) the composition of the Sub-Committee and its role and responsibilities; (b) the 
accreditation process; and (c) the substance of criteria or minimum standards set for 
accreditation. The paper was presented at the eighteenth and nineteenth sessions of the annual 
meeting of the ICC. In addition, members were asked to provide further comments in writing 
with a view to developing a final paper for presentation and adoption at the 20th ICC meeting 
(scheduled for April 2008).  
</p>
<p>8. In addition, and in response to comments made at the nineteenth session, the working 
group examined the issues of: (a) including a mechanism to challenge adverse accreditation 
recommendations within the accreditation process; and (b) the status that should be accorded to 
NHRIs while their accreditation status is being reviewed or recommendations on that status are 
being challenged. 
</p>
<p>9. In accordance with the recommendations of the seventeenth session of ICC in April 2006, 
it was agreed to initiate a review process of NHRIs already accredited with &#8220;A status&#8221; every five 
years. The process began in October 2006. It was also agreed that there would be a continuous 
review of accreditation of NHRIs every five years from the date of initial accreditation. 
</p>
<p>10. At its October 2007 session, the Sub-Committee on Accreditation adopted measures to 
improve its accreditation procedure, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; An appeal process to ensure that greater transparency and due process has been 
instituted by the Sub-Committee, especially for NHRIs that are deemed not to comply 
with the Paris Principles. Such NHRIs have 30 days to appeal the results of the 
Sub-Committee review with the full ICC membership then making a decision; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; A more rigorous review of each application for accreditation, including of the full 
documentation and statement of compliance submitted in advance of the session by 
NHRIs, with a detailed summary prepared by the secretariat (NIU) in close coordination 
with relevant parts of OHCHR. OHCHR is actively involved in the reviews and the 
Sub-Committee could also address NHRIs themselves, if necessary, through conference 
calls; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; More focused recommendations provided to each NHRI (no matter if it has A or 
B status) to ensure full compliance with the Paris Principles - even before the prescribed 
five-year time frame for review of accreditations;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Wider distribution and greater knowledge of the Sub-Committee recommendations by 
NHRIs and other stakeholders, so that they can play a proactive role in the context of 
follow-up action by the United Nations or NHRI regional coordinating bodies in the 
concerned country. The Sub-Committee reports are also posted on the Internet 
(www.nhri.net). 
</p>
<p><b>III.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>11. Following the practice initiated at its meeting in October 2006, the Sub-Committee 
continued to make general observations in relation to accreditation. These general observations 
have been formulated on common or important interpretative issues and are intended to 
constitute guidelines for members on the application process for accreditation or for the 
implementation of the Paris Principles. The list of general observations is not exhaustive and will 
continue to evolve as the Sub-Committee reviews additional applications.  
</p>
<p>12. The list of general observations adopted by the ICC in October 2006 is attached in annex II 
to this report. The general observations developed by the Sub-Committee at its March 2007 and 
October 2007 sessions have yet to be formally adopted by ICC, scheduled to take place at its 
twentieth session. </p>

<p>1. <b>Application processes</b>: With the growing interest in establishing National Institutions, and 
the introduction of the five yearly re-accreditation process, the volume of applications to be 
considered by the Sub-Committee has increased dramatically. In the interest of ensuring an 
efficient and effective accreditation process, the Sub-Committee emphasizes the following 
requirements: 
</p>
<p> (a) Deadlines for applications will be strictly enforced; 
</p>
<p> (b) Where the deadline for a re-accreditation application is not met, the Sub-Committee

materials have been received by the ICC Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>2. <b>Limitation of power of National Institutions due to national security</b>: The 
Sub-Committee notes that the scope of the mandate of many National Institutions is restricted for 
national security reasons. While this tendency is not inherently contrary to the Paris Principles, it 
is noted that consideration must be given to ensuring that such restriction is not unreasonably or 
arbitrarily applied and is exercised under due process. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>Ensuring pluralism</b>: The Sub-Committee notes there are diverse models of ensuring the 
requirement of pluralism set out in the Paris Principles. However, the Sub-Committee 
emphasizes the importance of National Institutions to maintain consistent relationships with civil 
society and notes that this will be taken into consideration in the assessment of accreditation 
applications. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee observes that there are different ways in which pluralism may be 
achieved through the composition of the National Institution, for example:  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (a) Members of the governing body represent different segments of society as referred to 
in the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) Pluralism through the appointment procedures of the governing body of the National 
Institution, for example, where diverse societal groups suggest or recommend candidates; 
</p>
<p> (c) Pluralism through procedures enabling effective cooperation with diverse societal 
groups, for example advisory committees, networks, consultations or public forums; or 
</p>
<p> (d) Pluralism through diverse staff representing the different societal groups within the 
society. 
</p>
<p> The Sub-Committee further emphasizes that the principle of pluralism includes ensuring 
the meaningful participation of women in the National Institution.  
</p>
<p>4. <b>Selection and appointment of the governing body</b>: The Sub-Committee notes the critical 
importance of the selection and appointment process of the governing body in ensuring the 
pluralism and independence of the National Institution. In particular, the Sub-Committee 
emphasizes the following factors:  
</p>
<p> (a) A transparent process; 
</p>
<p> (b) Broad consultation throughout the selection and appointment process; 
</p>
<p> (c) Advertising vacancies broadly;  
</p>
<p> (d) Maximizing the number of potential candidates from a wide range of societal groups; 
</p>
<p> (e) Selecting members to serve in their own individual capacity rather than on behalf of 
the organization they represent. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>Encouraging ratification or accession to international human rights instruments</b>: The 
Sub-Committee interprets that the function of encouraging ratification or accession to 
international human rights instruments, set out in the Paris Principles, is a key function of a 
National Institution. The Sub-Committee therefore encourages the entrenchment of this function 
in the enabling legislation of the National Institution to ensure the best protection of human 
rights within that country.  
</p>
<p>6. <b>Government representatives on National Institutions</b>: The Sub-Committee understands 
that the Paris Principles require that Government representatives on governing or advisory 
bodies of National Institutions do not have decision-making or voting capacity.
