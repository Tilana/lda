<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
practice conducted its first visit to Morocco from 13 to 20 February 2012 at the invitation 
of the Government. Two of its five members, the Chairperson-Rapporteur, Kamala 
Chandrakirana, and Emna Aouij, participated in the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with its mandate as contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
15/23, the objectives of the Working Group were to engage in dialogue with the 
Government of Morocco and other stakeholders on the issue of eliminating discrimination 
against women in law and in practice; to identify good practices relating to the elimination 
of laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory in terms of implementation 
or impact; and to make recommendations on the improvement of legislation and the 
implementation of the law. It considered the issue of discrimination against women in 
political and public life, given that the issue is its priority theme for 2012. The visit was 
guided by international human rights law in the assessment of the situation of equality 
between women and men and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex, and protection and 
promotion of women&#8217;s human rights. With regard to discrimination against women in law 
</p>
<p>and in practice in political and public life, the Working Group was guided by, inter alia, 
article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and articles 4 (1) and 
7 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group held extensive consultations in Rabat, Casablanca and Fes, and 
in the province of Khemisset, with Government officials, representatives of the legislature 
and judiciary, representatives of national and regional human rights institutions, civil 
society organizations and academics, and grass-roots women community leaders. It also 
held meetings with the United Nations country team and bilateral development 
organizations. The Government offered to facilitate a visit of the delegation to Laayoune or 
Dhakla for a day; owing to time and logistical constraints, however, the Working Group 
was unable to accept the offer. Given its interest in the situation of women in the non-self 
governing territory of Western Sahara, it may consider visiting the territory at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group expresses gratitude to the Government for agreeing to host its 
first visit and its cooperation in ensuring the success of the visit. It is grateful to the United 
Nations country team, including the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women, for its assistance prior to and during the visit, and to all 
interlocutors for their support of the mission. It looks forward to continuing to engage with 
the Government and other stakeholders on the issue of gender equality and women&#8217;s human 
rights and the implementation of the recommendations made in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. The visit of the Working Group to Morocco coincided with an important moment in 
the history of the country, namely, the culmination of a decade of democratic reforms in the 
adoption of a new Constitution on 29 July 2011, and the inauguration of a new Government 
following the general elections of November 2011. 
</p>
<p>6. Since his coronation on 23 July 1999, King Mohammed VI has pursued a process of 
democratization in Morocco, with equality and human rights at its core. Among the first 
measures implemented was the creation of the Independent Arbitration Commission, 
mandated to compensate victims for past human rights violations, and the Equity and 
Reconciliation Commission, tasked to determine the facts about past violations, provide 
victims and their families with reparations, and make recommendations to prevent future </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>violations. The processes, and the reforms brought about, have been carried out in dialogue 
with Moroccan society. 
</p>
<p>7. At the same time, women&#8217;s active claims to equality with men and human rights 
have contributed to putting the issue of discrimination, including the elimination of laws 
that discriminate against women, at the core of the national political agenda. As citizens 
with equal rights, Moroccan women have been at the forefront of widespread mobilization 
among cross sections of society to change long-standing discriminatory provisions in laws 
on nationality, commerce and employment, the penal system and family life, and to 
increase their participation in political life. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite these significant political and legal reforms, Morocco faced challenges in 
closing the gaps between promise and reality owing to serious socio-economic disparities 
across the country. Figures from the 2011 Human Development Report show that Morocco 
has achieved only medium human development for its population of 32.3 million people, 
58.8 per cent of whom live in urban areas. It was ranked 130 out of 187 countries on the 
2011 Human Development Index,1 although it has seen annual steady increments in its 
Index rating since 1980.2 According to the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index,3 
the loss in potential human development in Morocco due to inequality was 29.7 per cent. 
On other indices, such as the Gender Inequality Index, Morocco ranks 130 out of 187 
countries.4 On the Global Gender Gap Index, Morocco ranked 129th of the 134 countries 
surveyed.5 Its adult literacy rate is 56.1 per cent (of people aged 15 years or older).6 The 
female adult literacy rate is approximately 49.2 per cent,7 and the female youth literacy rate 
is approximately 72 per cent (ages 15 to 24 years).8 Boys outnumber girls in primary net 
enrolment rates.9 The under-5 mortality rate was reported at 36 per 1,000 live births in 
2010.10 Health adjusted life expectancy is 62 years. 
</p>
<p>9. Economic and social disparities, coupled with civil and political grievances and 
fatigue with reported endemic corruption, led to the outbreak of popular protests in 
February 2011 in Morocco, as in other countries in the region. On 20 February, thousands 
of Moroccans assembled in Rabat to call for power-sharing and changes to the Constitution, 
with intermittent protests continuing thereafter in cities throughout the country. In response, 
the King accelerated the process of reforms. On 9 March 2011, he initiated further 
devolution of powers to the regions and other territorial collectives and the reform of the 
Constitution, constituting a committee for this latter purpose and tasking it to engage in 
consultations with Moroccan society. A fundamental precept behind the devolution of 
powers was, as described in the King&#8217;s address to the nation on 9 March 2011, the 
</p>
<p>reinforcement of women&#8217;s participation in the management of regional and subregional 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Index measures the average achievements in a country with regard to a long and healthy life, 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge and a decent standard of living.

<p>affairs and the exercise by women of their political rights, with equal access among women 
and men to elected office guaranteed by law. 
</p>
<p>10. In June 2011, the advisory committee for the revision of the Constitution presented a 
draft Constitution to the King. It was approved by national referendum on 1 July 2011. 
According to reports by the Ministry for the Interior, more than 70 per cent of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>13 million registered voters took part in the referendum, and approximately 98 per cent 
voted in favour of the reforms. The new Constitution thus enjoys broad-based legitimacy 
and, with the other legal advances of the past decade, provides a unique foundation on 
which to close long-standing gaps in human rights enjoyment between women and men. It 
reflects the evolution in Moroccan society and promises to be a key tool to advance 
development and assure the country a robust role in the region and the world. 
</p>
<p>11. The new Constitution establishes Morocco as a constitutional, democratic, 
parliamentary and social monarchy. It embodies principles of participation, pluralism and 
good governance. It acknowledges that the country&#8217;s unity is forged by, on the one hand, its 
</p>
<p>history, civilization and multicultural roots and, on the other, its commitment to the values 
of openness, moderation, tolerance and dialogue. The Constitution unites respect for 
religion and human rights, and the fight against all forms of discrimination, including on 
the grounds of sex. The King is the guarantor of respect for all fundamental freedoms and 
rights and the functioning of institutions. 
</p>
<p>12. Following parliamentary elections on 25 November 2011, the King appointed a 
Head of Government from the party that won the most parliamentary seats. The Justice and 
Development Party, which espouses, inter alia, a system of values based on Islam, won 107 
of 395 seats; its Secretary-General, Abdelilah Benkirane, was appointed Prime Minister. 
The new Government was formed on 3 January 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> III. </b>Legal framework for equality and women&#8217;s hu<b>man rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Achievements in eliminating discriminatory laws 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Constitution establishes the primacy of international law in the domestic legal 
order and requires that domestic laws be harmonized with international legal obligations. 
Morocco is party to eight of the nine core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Morocco has not 
accepted any individual complaint procedure under these instruments. 
</p>
<p>14. On 8 April 2011, Morocco withdrew its reservations to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in relation to article 9 (2), on 
transfer of nationality to children, and article 16, on equality in marriage and divorce. It did 
not, however, lift declarations in relation to article 2 stating that this provision would apply 
only to the extent that it was compatible with Islamic sharia and to article 15 (4), which is 
subject to articles 34 and 36 of the Family Code (<i>Moudawana</i>). The scope of these 
declarations go beyond mere interpretation of articles 2 and 15 (4) and, in fact, limit the 
country&#8217;s obligations to implement fully these provisions. 
</p>
<p>15. Article 19 of the new Constitution enshrines the principle of equality between men 
and women in the enjoyment of all human rights. It establishes that the State is responsible 
for achieving equality between men and women and creates a body, the Autorit&#233; pour la </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>parit&#233; et la lutte contre toutes les formes de discrimination, to advance progress in these 
areas. 
</p>
<p>16. The Constitution consolidates the achievements of past legal reforms that have 
contributed to enhancing equality between women and men and lessening discrimination 
against women. These reforms included the revision of the Commercial Code in 1995, the 
adoption of the new Law on Civil Registration in 2002, the new Code of Criminal 
Procedure in 2003 and continuing reform of the Penal Code since 2003, amendments to the 
Labour Code in 2003, reform of the Family Code in 2004, and reform of the Nationality 
Code in 2007. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Closing gaps in legal protection for women 
</b></p>
<p>17. While the legal reforms, including those of the Family Code, are to be commended, 
some discriminatory provisions remain in existing laws and perpetuate inequalities and 
discrimination against women in Morocco. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Family Code 
</b></p>
<p>18. The reform of the Family Code, which governs, inter alia, marriage, including 
polygamy, divorce, guardianship and child custody, and inheritance, was based both on 
religious references and universal values, and took into account the requirements of 
development, progress and social justice. It entered into force on 5 February 2004 and 
stipulates, inter alia, that spouses have equal rights and duties in the family, and that the 
minimum age of marriage for girls is 18; established the right to divorce for women, 
including by mutual consent; places polygamy and repudiation (unilateral divorce by the 
husband) under strict judicial control; rescinds the wife&#8217;s duty to obey her husband; 
eliminates the requirement for women to have the consent of a marital guardian (<i>wali</i>) to 
marry and grants them more rights in the negotiation of marriage contracts; and greater 
rights of custody of children. 
</p>
<p>19. Nonetheless, discriminatory provisions remain in force and the evolutionary spirit of 
the law is often not taken into consideration. With regard to marriage, article 20 permits a 
judge to authorize the marriage of minors before the legal age of 18. Such a decision cannot 
be reversed, since there is no possibility to appeal against it. Articles 40 to 46 govern 
polygamy; although the practice is subject to strict conditions, it is authorized if a man is 
able to prove to a judge that he can support two families and has an objective and 
exceptional reason for wanting two families. Women may forbid polygamy in the marriage 
contract. Article 45 requires the first wife to give consent to a second marriage or request 
divorce; according to article 46, the future second wife must be informed of the man&#8217;s 
marital status and must consent to the marriage. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to divorce, article 98 of the Moudawana grants women the right to file 
for &#8220;divorce for prejudice&#8221; (divorce pour cause de prejudice) on the grounds of, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>harmful behaviour by the husband, such as abandonment, failure to provide financial 
support or physical abuse. However, although physical abuse is one of the grounds for 
divorce, according to article 100, the wife must be able to call on witnesses to support her 
claims. Either spouse may initiate divorce by mutual consent or with compensation (<i>Khol</i>) 
or on grounds of discord (divorce pour raison de discorde) or irreconcilable differences 
(<i>Chiqaq</i>). In cases with compensation, the woman may obtain a divorce by paying financial 
compensation to her husband (<i>Khula</i>), traditionally by returning the dower. Husbands may 
initiate divorce by &#8220;repudiation&#8221;, although this is subject to judicial oversight. Divorced 
women are required to wait for a period of up to four months before remarrying. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>21. With regard to guardianship and the custody of children, according to article 171, 
the mother is granted primary custody of a child, followed by the father and the maternal 
grandmother. The father does not automatically assume custody of children when mothers 
remarry or move away. However, according to article 175, a divorced woman with children 
over the age of 7 loses custody of the children if she remarries and the former husband 
requests custody. 
</p>
<p>22. The reform of the Moudawana did not remove inequalities between men and women 
in inheritance, as it is governed by the principles of Islam, although maternal grandchildren 
may inherit from their grandparents (whereas previously only paternal grandchildren were 
eligible to inherit from their grandparents). Women are disadvantaged in inheritance 
situations, with daughters typically receiving half the amount set aside for sons. In practice, 
women, especially in rural areas, often give up their unequal share of inheritance to male 
relatives. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Nationality Code 
</b></p>
<p>23. The reform of the Nationality Code in 2007 gave Moroccan women married to 
Moroccan men the right, by virtue of article 6, to transmit their nationality to their children 
on the same basis. Furthermore, Moroccan women married to some foreign men gained the 
right to pass Moroccan citizenship on to their children, which benefitted many children who 
had previously been stateless. This provision only applies, however, to children born to a 
Moroccan woman and a Muslim non-citizen who marries in accordance with the Family 
Code. According to article 10, women do not have the right to pass their nationality on to 
their foreign husbands, although men can automatically transmit their nationality to their 
non-Moroccan wives. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Penal Code 
</b></p>
<p>24. The amendments introduced to the Penal Code since 2003 have criminalized sexual 
harassment, stipulated that both spouses are equally liable for adultery, removed the legal 
excuse of provocation often used by husbands to justify violence, and increased the 
penalties for assault and battery by one spouse against the other. The Penal Code does not, 
however, deal adequately with domestic violence, which is addressed under general 
criminal law provisions that do not sanction marital rape. Article 475, which falls under 
section IV, on the abduction and non-representation of minors,<b> </b>provides that a kidnapper or 
seducer of a minor girl may be acquitted of rape if he marries her. The application of this 
provision is an important element in the case of the recent suicide of a 16 year-old teenager, 
Amina Filali, who was allegedly forced to marry her rapist. In addition, under articles 486 
to 488 of the Penal Code, rape is considered a crime against morality and not identified as a 
crime against the person. 
</p>
<p>25. Article 490 criminalizes consensual sex between unmarried people, providing for 
punishments ranging from one month to one year in jail. While these cases are rarely 
prosecuted given that conviction depends on either eyewitness testimony or a confession by 
one of the parties, an unmarried woman&#8217;s pregnancy is proof of sexual relations and may 
</p>
<p>lead to criminal prosecution. Non-therapeutic abortions are criminalized, which leads to 
illegal abortions that can jeopardize women&#8217;s lives. The Penal Code has been under 
</p>
<p>revision since 2008 and the process is ongoing. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Labour Code 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Labour Code, enacted in 2004, enshrines in article 9 the principle of non-
discrimination, including on the basis of sex, in recruitment, conduct and division of labour, 
salary, promotions, benefits, discipline and dismissal, and vocational training. Article 346 
prohibits sex-based discrimination in pay for work of equal value. The Labour Code does </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>not, however, provide protection for domestic workers who are for the most part women 
and girls, and migrant workers. Article 4 states that domestic workers&#8217; employment and 
</p>
<p>working conditions are covered by a special law, which is yet to be enacted. The 
Government confirmed that it is considering bills to fill the gaps in legal protection for 
domestic and migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender bias in the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Government and civil society have taken steps to raise awareness of the 
equality, empowerment and protective provisions of laws, including within the judiciary 
and in society in general. Family sections within district courts and family courts have been 
established to support enforcement of the Moudawana. Nonetheless, gender-sensitive 
interpretation and enforcement of the law remain areas for progress.  
</p>
<p>28. Many stakeholders expressed concern about regressive court rulings in relation to 
implementation of the Family Code, including with regard to early marriage and polygamy. 
For example, in the case of marriage of minors, of 38,710 requests for authorization to 
marry below the legal age, 33,596 (86.79 per cent) were granted and 4.151 (10.72 per cent) 
were refused, while 963 requests were withdrawn.11 The majority of requests, 38,331, were 
for early marriage of girls. Despite stringent legal conditions for approval of polygamy, 
43.5 per cent of applications were approved by judges.12 <i>Chiqaq</i> is often interpreted by 
judges as a divorce for prejudice, thus requiring women to produce evidence and witnesses 
to support their petitions. 
</p>
<p>29. Government officials, including the Minister for Justice, and other stakeholders 
admitted that, in spite of the advances of the past decade, cultural and societal attitudes and 
behaviours pose significant obstacles to full equality and rights for women in Morocco, 
including in the administration of justice. Many specified that the law, even with its 
shortcomings, is often more advanced than the mentalities of the magistrates and judges 
who are entrusted with its implementation, and that the Moudawana is being divested of 
meaning by some enforcing judges. Training for magistrates and judges has been 
insufficient and has not produced the desired results. Conservative and patriarchal attitudes 
permeate the law and its application, and serve to maintain harmful practices. 
</p>
<p>30. The case of Amina Filali demonstrates that the law and its application essentially 
permitted a criminal offence to occur, allowed the perpetrator to escape punishment by 
marrying the victim, and placed the dishonour of the act on the victim and her family. 
Amina Filali suffered victimization by the rapist; the judicial personnel who allegedly 
advised her father to safeguard the family&#8217;s honour by allowing the abuser to marry his 
victim; her family, who reportedly disowned her for complaining about the continued abuse 
of the rapist now her husband; and the State, which failed in its due diligence obligations to 
prevent the violations and protect her human rights, resulting in her suicide. As at 18 March 
2012, only the Minister for Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development had 
publicly spoken out on this case, calling for a debate to reform the law. This case should 
remind the Government that it must show leadership in preventing such practices and 
protecting victims, in accordance with its international human rights legal obligations. Any 
debate on reforming the law must aim to give effect to the country&#8217;s obligations under 
</p>
<p>international law, which are enshrined in its Constitution.

<p>31. The Minister for Justice expressed his intention to the Working Group of conducting 
a comprehensive assessment of implementation of the Family Code and its impact on 
Moroccan society. The Working Group welcomes this initiative and hopes that such a 
review will shed light on challenges in implementing the law and serve as the basis for 
more initiatives by the Ministry, including to monitor legal proceedings and outcomes and 
to assess the extent to which they uphold international human rights standards and national 
laws. The Working Group also notes that magistrates and judges play a critical role in 
ensuring effective implementation of the law and safeguarding equality and women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights and, in this regard, the gains of the past decade. Their understanding of the 
evolutionary spirit of the law in conformity with international law, and their willingness to 
give effect to it, are crucial. 
</p>
<p>32. In addition, access to justice is reportedly difficult for vulnerable groups of women, 
such as non-Moroccan women and trafficked women. Although Morocco acceded to the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime on 25 April 2011, domestic laws have yet to be harmonized with the Protocol. 
Despite being victims of human rights abuses, trafficked women continue to be 
criminalized. The Working Group would welcome a review of access to justice for 
vulnerable groups of women and efforts to ensure that they benefit from equal protection of 
the law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. C</b>ultural and societal obstacles to women&#8217;s equal benefit and protection 
<b>by the law 
</b></p>
<p>33. Patriarchal and conservative positions further influence how women are treated and 
portrayed in private and public spheres, and have an impact on their opportunities and 
status in society. Some interlocutors noted that women are considered to be of lesser value 
than men, and many popular sayings portray them as inferior. On ttelevision, they are often 
portrayed as weak in mind and spirit, and confined to stereotyped roles, such as homemaker 
and teacher. In employment and other sectors, women are confined to certain jobs, for 
example, accounting for 80 per cent of those employed in the textile industry, while men 
dominate the justice sector. 
</p>
<p>34. The Government is taking action to combat these phenomena, including through 
education and the media. With regard to education, which is critical to combatting 
discrimination against women, the education sector benefits from the largest budget in 
Morocco and a variety of initiatives have been taken to reform the system, including 
modernizing curricula and allowing mixed schools. Quality and the appropriateness of 
education seem, however, to pose a problem. Furthermore, while there is greater enrolment 
of girls in primary education, between the ages of 12 and 15, girls often drop out of school. 
In some regions, the retention rate in secondary schools is less than 80 per cent. The 
Government is providing parents with financial incentives to allow girls to stay in school 
until the age of 16 and has taken other measures, such as improving schools and girls&#8217; 
access to them. With regard to the media, it has inter alia, elaborated a strategy to 
institutionalize equality issues in the communications sector. Civil society organizations 
highlighted other measures, such as a weekly radio programme in Fes that hosts discussions 
on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group found that further measures to fight against stereotyped and 
negative portrayals of women are needed. The Government and all parts of Moroccan 
society, including men and religious leaders, and all means available, including education 
and the media, should be mobilized to combat these phenomena. Religious perspectives, 
which reflect cultural identity, play an important role in portraying women in the most </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>favourable light. Women imams (&#8220;Morchidates&#8221;) have a greater role to play in national 
</p>
<p>campaigns to raise awareness of women&#8217;s rights and to disseminate a culture of equality 
throughout the country, as do civil society and the media. Education must be adjusted to 
include knowledge on rights and law and how to claim these, and address obstacles to 
equality and the protection and promotion of human rights for girls and women. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Securing institutional coherence for gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>36. The visit of the Working Group coincided with reinforcement of the institutional 
framework to secure democracy and human rights. The Constitution extended protection to 
a number of institutions, and other institutions were being established or operationalized to 
reinforce the enjoyment of freedoms and rights in Morocco. Together, they provide a tool 
to ensure equality and the enjoyment of women&#8217;s human rights.  
</p>
<p>37. An interministerial delegation for human rights was established in April 2011 to 
coordinate with other Government ministries and offices on Government efforts to protect 
and promote human rights and international humanitarian law. The delegation coordinated 
the visit of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>38. The National Human Rights Council operates in accordance with the Principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (the Paris Principles).13 It is an independent and representative institution charged 
with the defence of human rights and that, inter alia, makes recommendations on the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>adherence to international human rights standards and harmonization of domestic 
legislation, and receives complaints of human rights violations. It is gradually becoming 
operational in the regions. 
</p>
<p>39. The institution of the Mediator is an independent national institution responsiblefor 
dealing with citizen complaints against the public administration. In the conduct of its 
work, the institution provides women with legal assistance in the context of defending 
citizen&#8217;s rights and transparency in public administration.  
</p>
<p>40. The National Human Rights Council and the Mediator are dedicated to ensuring 
greater coherence and efficiency in the protection and promotion of human rights, including 
for women. Both benefit from good representation of women in their composition and are 
responsive to women&#8217;s rights concerns. Women account for 43 per cent of Council 
membership at the national level, and approximately 30 per cent at the regional level. 
</p>
<p>41. Other institutions, such as the High Authority for Audiovisual Communications, one 
of whose main tasks is to ensure respect for plural expression of opinion, thought and 
freedom of information in public or private broadcasting, have an important role to play in 
ensuring that women&#8217;s rights are well presented in the media. In its regulatory role, the 
Authority requires, inter alia, operators to dedicate a certain number of programmes to 
women and their role in society. A unit and a working group in the Authority are 
responsible for monitoring and analysing the presence and portrayal of women in 
audiovisual media in Morocco. On International Women&#8217;s Day 2012, the working group 
presented a report on the image of women in Morocco; since the adoption of the new 
Constitution, the mandate of the working group has been extended to include attention to 
equality issues. Women&#8217;s rights advocates noted that they had submitted a complaint to the 
</p>
<p>  
 13 General Assembly resolution 48/134, annex. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Authority in relation to the broadcasting of stereotypical images of women on a quiz show. 
The Authority has initiated an inquiry and promised an official response. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 19 of the Constitution providing for the establishment of an &#8220;authority for 
parity and the fight against all forms of discrimination&#8221; is a significant contribution to the 
</p>
<p>fight for women&#8217;s equality. The authority is tasked with ensuring respect for article 19 and 
monitoring compliance with parity principles. The body could contribute to improving 
coordination of gender equality and women&#8217;s rights activities undertaken by the various 
</p>
<p>Government offices and civil society, including women&#8217;s human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p>Legislation will be introduced to define its mandate and, in accordance with article 164, the 
division of functions with the National Human Rights Council. Two public debates have 
already been held in relation to the creation of the authority, under the leadership of the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group is of the view that the law to operationalize &#8220;the authority for 
parity and the fight against all forms of discrimination&#8221; should be developed in consultation 
</p>
<p>with all relevant stakeholders and enacted in a timely manner. It stresses that it is important 
that the authority have an independent status, autonomy of management, skilled personnel, 
an adequate budget, and be subject to good governance.  
</p>
<p>44.  Given the multiplicity of national institutions in Morocco, the Working Group notes 
that a key challenge is to achieve coherence and consistency across institutions, including 
in securing gender equality, and to avoid duplication, fragmentation and conflicts of interest 
in the conduct of their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Implementing national policies to promote equality and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government informed the Working Group of several national strategies, 
policies and programmes aimed at promoting equality and human rights, including the 2006 
national strategy and plan of action for equity, equality and gender mainstreaming in 
development policies and programmes, the 2007 Citizens&#8217; Platform for the Promotion of a 
Culture of Human Rights, which for the period 2011-2014 is focusing on awareness-
raising, education and training on human rights, and the post-1993 Vienna World 
Conference on Human Rights National Plan of Action on Democracy and Human Rights, 
which was updated in the light of the new Constitution and deals with, inter alia, 
governance and democracy; economic, social and environmental rights; and the legal and 
institutional framework. Both programmes were developed with the National Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>46. The Government has adopted an agenda for equality for the period 2011-2015. The 
agenda was coordinated by the former Ministry of Social Development, Family and 
Solidarity in collaboration with 25 departments and adopted by the former Government, in 
March 2011. It is organized around nine priority areas, 30 strategic objectives and 100 
measures for equality between men and women across 25 Government sectors. Women&#8217;s 
associations raised concerns that, in introducing its future programme to Parliament on 19 
January 2012, the incoming Government did not refer to the agenda for equality either in 
the context of the State&#8217;s commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, 
including Goal 3 on gender equality, or in the context of its compliance with international 
conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. They were concerned about these omissions and their potential impact on 
achievements in relation to women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group is of the view that the agenda is a key tool to advance equality 
and women&#8217;s human rights. It noted that, on International Women&#8217;s Day 2012, the Minister </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>for Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development stated that her Ministry was 
considering developing a Government plan to promote gender equality and make equality 
principles binding in all governmental sectors.14 It encourages the Government to reaffirm 
its constitutionally-mandated commitment to adopt comprehensive and continuing 
measures to eliminate discrimination against women by taking immediate steps to endorse 
the agenda for equality and to move quickly to its implementation.47. The implementation 
of laws and policies are supported by the Government&#8217;s adoption of a gender-sensitive 
budgeting approach, which aims to ensure equal distribution of resources to promote 
equality between men and women. This approach, inter alia, analyses inequalities that 
hinder development with a view to taking corrective actions to render development more 
inclusive, equal and results-oriented in relation to the enjoyment of human rights. It obliges 
reporting on the extent to which women&#8217;s rights are being realized in the implementation of 
public policies. 
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group emphasizes the importance of public accountability and 
independent oversight of all Government measures and programmes, including by civil 
society groups. It is of the view that the National Human Rights Council and its regional 
commissions play a crucial role, as the country&#8217;s independent human rights monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanism, in assessing the human rights impact of all Government programmes on 
women and making recommendations for continuous improvement.  
</p>
<p><b> V. </b>Gender equality and women&#8217;s participation in political and public life<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. Women have had the right to vote and stand for office in Morocco since 1963. 
While data show that women&#8217;s participation in political life in Morocco has increased as a 
result of ad hoc measures and that women are willing to engage in politics, their 
participation is still hampered by prevailing patriarchal attitudes, social constraints and 
other factors. 
</p>
<p>50. With regard to the participation of women in Parliament, in the election to the 
Chamber of Councillors in 2003, there was no national list and only 0.56 per cent of elected 
communal representatives were women. In 2009, women held six of 270 seats, representing 
2.2 per cent in that Chamber. 
</p>
<p>51. In 2002, political parties adopted for the first time a quota that reserved 30 (9.2 per 
cent) of the 325 seats in the Chamber of Representatives for female candidates. As a result, 
35 women (10.77 per cent) were elected to the Chamber. This quota was not, however, 
established by law but was rather embodied in an agreement between political parties. In 
the 2007 parliamentary elections, political parties again resorted to affirmative action, and 
30 women were elected. The Government formed in 2007 had the greatest number of 
women in Moroccan history: seven women heads of ministries (of 36). In the 2009 local 
elections, &#8220;supplementary lists&#8221; enabled women to win around 12 per cent of the seats. A 
</p>
<p>woman was elected mayor in Marrakech and 13 women were elected president of a 
commune. 
</p>
<p><b> A. In</b>stitutionalizing measures to increase women&#8217;s political representation <b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Constitution renews hope of increasing women&#8217;s participation in decision-
making bodies. In response to the claims of women&#8217;s movements, and in particular of the 
Movement for a third of the seats towards parity, article 30 enshrines the right of men and 
</p>
<p>  
 14 See www.maroc.ma/PortailInst/Fr/logoevenementiel/journee+internationale+de+la+femme.htm. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>women to vote and stand as candidates in elections, and provides that laws will establish 
measures to promote equal access of men and women to elective office. Article 146 
provides for legislation to promote increased participation of women within regional 
councils. Two organic laws relevant to women&#8217;s political participation have been enacted. 
</p>
<p>53. Organic law No. 27-11 of 14 October 2011 on the Chamber of Representatives 
establishes a quota of 60 seats for women out of a total of 395 (15 per cent). According to 
article 23, 90 Members of Parliament are elected at the national level, and the remaining 
305 are elected at the local level. The law requires that the lists of candidates presented by 
parties at the national level comprise 60 women and 30 men aged less than 40 years; 
however, there is no quota applying to lists presented at the local level. As a result, in the 
parliamentary elections held in November 2011, the total number of women elected was 67, 
or 17 per cent of the total membership. The local elections, tentatively scheduled for late 
2012, will be an opportunity to redress the situation and institutionalize women&#8217;s lists. 
</p>
<p>54. Organic law No. 29-11 of 21 October 2011 on political parties provides, in article 
26, that all political parties must work to achieve a proportion of one third of women in 
their governing bodies at the national and regional levels, although the law does not include 
sanctions for failure to respect this provision. It therefore does not recognize the role that 
political parties need to play in promoting equality and women&#8217;s human rights. In the 2011 
</p>
<p>elections, only 57 women were at the top of the lists at the local level out of 1,521 lists. 
Women accounted for only 4 per cent of candidates. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group recalls that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women requires States to achieve not only purely formal or de jure 
equality, that is equality between women and men in and before the law with respect to 
formal opportunities and treatment, but also de facto or substantive equality, whereby 
women enjoy equality with men in practice. While numerical representation of women is 
important, substantive representation of women goes beyond numbers and is about how 
women and men, in decision-making positions, produce gender-responsive policy 
formulation and implementation. It is therefore critical to look beyond the numbers to the 
contexts and conditions that allow women to participate on an equal footing with men, 
including in political and public life. 
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>Advancing women&#8217;s meaningful and effective participation in<b> public 
life 
</b></p>
<p>56. The new Government&#8217;s programme, presented to Parliament on 19 January 2012, 
contains many positive aspects on women, including the adoption of affirmative action in 
appointments and senior positions, and provides encouragement for women to participate in 
political parties and civil society organizations. In addition, the Ministry of Public Affairs 
and Modernization of the State established a consultative interministerial committee with 
the objective of attaining gender equality in the civil service. 
</p>
<p>57. Nonetheless, the meagre representation of women in the composition of the new 
Government and the reported explanation that this was due to lack of competent women 
candidates leads many to question the extent of current commitment and political 
willingness to promote equality and women&#8217;s rights in practice. Many stakeholders 
</p>
<p>expressed their regret at the gap between rhetoric and reality. 
</p>
<p>58. Women&#8217;s representation in senior decision-making positions in the public service is 
particularly low. While women represent more than one third of the total number of public 
servants, they account for only 12 per cent of leadership positions. Only two women are 
governors. Currently, only 10 of 84 ambassadors are women. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>59. In 2012, women occupied 20 per cent of all judicial posts; they accounted for 21 per 
cent of judges and 11.8 per cent of prosecutors.15 According to article 115 of the 
Constitution, representation of women judges is to be secured among the 10 elected 
members of the Supreme Council of the judiciary, in proportion to their presence in the 
judiciary. In January 2012, the Moroccan Association of Women Judges announced that it 
would submit a claim to the Supreme Court calling for increased representation of women 
in the judiciary and access to the highest positions. 
</p>
<p>60. At present, none of the eight heads of parliamentary groups of political parties is a 
woman. Of the 13 members of the bureau of Parliament, three are women. One woman 
presides over a parliamentary commission (specialized parliamentary bodies) out of a total 
of eight. Therefore, only four women hold positions allowing them to influence the 
functioning of Parliament. 
</p>
<p>61. Article 12 of the Constitution recognizes the role and space of civil society 
organizations, including women&#8217;s associations, in public affairs. It gives them the 
possibility to make proposals, and monitor and evaluate public policies. 
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group takes note of the report prepared by the consultative 
commission on regionalization, in which it aimed to promote substantive equality at the 
level of the regions and other territorial collectives and to contribute to modernization of 
State structures and participatory democracy. With regard to measures to increase women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>political and public participation, the commission recommended systematic integration of a 
gender perspective into all aspects of the governance system and appropriate incentives to 
ensure women&#8217;s access to one third of elected posts and other offices in local authorities. It 
</p>
<p>also recommended that political parties promote the political participation of women and 
their access to elective and management responsibilities in their regions, especially through 
public funding. If implemented, this will be a major step towards parity at all levels of 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Empowerment of rural women and disadvantaged groups of 
women 
</b></p>
<p>63. The advances made in the past decade have yet to bear fruit for rural women and 
other disadvantaged groups of women in Morocco, who often confront multiple forms of 
discrimination, including on the basis of their status, and lack of opportunities. While many 
initiatives and measures have improved their situation, much more needs to be done to 
enable them to claim and enjoy their human rights in equality. The devolution of powers to 
the regions is a means to combat rural poverty and empower women to be active agents for 
change, including by increasing their participation in political life. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rural women 
</b></p>
<p>64. In 2010, the rural population stood at approximately 13.45 million people,16 of 
which some 2 million were considered poor. Approximately 75 per cent of rural households 
depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.17 Poverty disproportionately affects rural areas 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>in Morocco. In addition, illiteracy, unemployment and lack of access to social services 
continue to plague rural settings. In 2009, the literacy rate in rural areas reached almost 
44.4 per cent.18 
</p>
<p>65. Rural women suffer the hardships of poverty and are confronted with multiple forms 
of discrimination that prevent them from participating meaningfully in society, including in 
political and public life. They are discriminated against for being women and by virtue of 
geography. They face inequalities and subservience to men, lack choices and opportunities, 
and are often illiterate, which renders them unaware of the law and their rights, and how to 
claim them. In addition, firewood collection, lack of means of family planning and lack of 
access to microcredit financing keep rural women in a state of quasi-servitude.19 Child 
marriages affect approximately 21 per cent of rural girls in Morocco,20 often resulting in 
early pregnancies, which expose them to health problems. Complications during pregnancy 
or labour are the main cause of death for girls aged between 15 and 19 years, and 
adolescent girls are two to five times more likely to die from pregnancy-related 
complications than women in their twenties; furthermore, their children are 1.5 times more 
likely to die before their first birthday.21 Poverty affects women&#8217;s independence, including 
in rural areas; for example, 66 per cent of married women in the wealthiest quintile usually 
make decisions themselves or with their husbands on household purchases, as against 32 
per cent of women in the poorest quintile.22 
</p>
<p>66. In the 1990s, Morocco began to implement policies and programmes designed to 
alleviate rural poverty, including by facilitating access to potable water, electricity, roads 
and social services. The &#8220;Programme d&#8217;alimentation group&#233;e en eau potable rurale&#8221;, 
launched in 1995, has improved access to potable water from 62 per cent in 2004 to 92 per 
cent in 2011. According to a Government evaluation of phase II of the &#8220;Programme 
national des routes rurales (2005-2011)&#8221;, girls&#8217; school attendance rates reached 55 per cent 
where the projects were implemented, compared with 33 per cent in areas where they were 
not. The Barnamaj Aoulaouiyat Jtimaiya, a social priorities programme, which was 
implemented from 1996 to 2003 to extend education and health services in 14 rural 
provinces, produced positive results.23 
</p>
<p>67. In 2005, the King launched the National Human Development Initiative as part of 
the national poverty reduction strategy for Morocco. The Initiative targets 403 of the 
poorest rural communes in Morocco. It aims to combat poverty, vulnerability and exclusion 
in rural communities by addressing both territorial and gender disparities. It reinforces the 
capacity of poor people, including women, to benefit from projects and revenues from 
microcredit schemes. The microcredit provisions are important because, despite the 
revision of the Commercial Code in 1995, rural women continued to face difficulties in 
securing loans, including for not having assets or bank accounts. The Local Committee for 
Human Development is made up of one third local elected officials, one third non-

<p>governmental organizations and one third local civil service. Reports indicate that, in the 
first phase of the Initiative (2005 to 2010), 5.2 million people were direct beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group met with women leaders and members of a cooperative, the 
Souaber Association in Khemisset, supported by the National Human Development 
Initiative, who attested to its life-transforming nature. Empowered rural women are now 
being encouraged by their peers and other stakeholders to stand for local elections. 
Nonetheless, some stakeholders expressed concern about the limited benefit to women and 
ownership of the Initiative, despite the resources invested. They stated that many projects 
did not respond to women&#8217;s needs, and women&#8217;s ownership of the programme was weak. 
Furthermore, they pointed out that much of the revenue had been used to cover 
administrative costs and the creation of institutions, and highlighted the need for a shift 
away from inputs and processes to outputs and results. 
</p>
<p>69. The second phase of the Initiative runs from 2011 to 2015 with a budget of 17 
billion dirham, and will extend to 702 rural communes, including in mountainous regions 
which have to date been difficult to reach. The Working Group takes the view that it is 
critical that the second phase be guided by a rights-based perspective and guarantee 
women&#8217;s full and active ownership of the programme in order to ensure sustainable results 
for the enjoyment of equality and human rights for all rural women. It is important for a 
complaints mechanism to be established so that the most marginalized have an avenue to 
seek recourse and accountability when their needs and voices are not heard. 
</p>
<p>70. Other complementary initiatives are under way to empower and protect the rural 
population. For example, the Ministry of Culture has opened libraries in rural areas with 
materials of different levels of difficulty to promote literacy. Health-care caravans travel to 
some rural areas to provide services. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Divorced women and widows 
</b></p>
<p>71. Divorced women and widows face hardships in a society that emphasizes the 
importance of marriage and the family. Often they have no access to employment and 
resources, and are rendered vulnerable by their divorce, especially when the husband is 
unable or refuses to pay alimony, or following the death of the spouse. 
</p>
<p>72. The Finance Law of 2011 created a family fund (fonds d&#8217;entraide familiale) to 
directly assist divorced women, widows and family members who did not receive food aid. 
The ministries of finance and justice and l&#8217;Entraide nationale launched the fund in 2011. At 
</p>
<p>the time of the visit of the Working Group however, no funds had yet been disbursed. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Unmarried women 
</b></p>
<p>73. A 2011 national survey conducted in Morocco by the Institution nationale de 
solidarit&#233; avec les femmes en d&#233;tresse revealed that as many as 500,000 children were born 
outside of marriage between 2003 and 2010. Pregnancy outside marriage often results in 
women being excluded from their families and society because of cultural and religious 
norms; furthermore, unmarried pregnant women are liable to criminal prosecution. In most 
cases, unmarried women are rendered more vulnerable because of illiteracy, lack of skills 
and unemployment. Many are compelled to terminate their pregnancies or to abandon their 
children. 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group commends the Government for extending the National Human 
Development Initiative to associations such as the Association Solidarit&#233; F&#233;minine, which 
provides day-care facilities, literacy and vocational training, and self-employment </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>opportunities through microcredit financing for single mothers. The Working Group 
believes that more needs to be done, including with regard to closing evident gaps in access 
to information on sexual and reproductive rights in school curricula and youth centres, and 
to services to avoid unwanted pregnancies. In addition, many non-governmental 
organizations that provide single mothers with support are tolerated by the State but are not 
formally protected by law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Women in seasonal employment 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Working Group received reports of a lack of enforcement of labour rights for 
Moroccan women who are employed on a seasonal and temporary basis to harvest 
strawberries in the region of Larache, in northern Morocco. Interlocutors confirmed that 
women are employed under precarious terms and endure difficult working and living 
conditions. For example, they are reportedly transported in inhumane conditions in vans to 
and from work, and are subject to other hazards, such as insecticides. Civil society 
organizations, international groups such as OXFAM, and the Government collaborate in 
initiatives to improve working conditions. The Working Group was also informed that 
Moroccan women who pick strawberries in Huelva, in Andaluc&#237;a (Spain), are exposed to 
similar employment, living and working conditions, and are also made vulnerable because 
of inadequate efforts by the countries of origin and destination to protect them.24 
</p>
<p><b> E. Women subject to gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>76. Gender-based violence is a serious concern in Morocco. A national study conducted 
in 2011 on the prevalence of violence against women found that, of 9.5 million women 
aged between 18 to 64 years surveyed, nearly 6 million (62.8 per cent) had suffered an act 
of violence in the preceding 12 months. Violence was more prevalent in urban (3.8 million) 
than rural (2.2 million) settings. In 55 per cent of cases, the husband was the perpetrator. In 
13.5 per cent of cases, family members were responsible.25 
</p>
<p>77. The Government has taken steps to address the problem. The Penal Code includes 
some provisions to protect women and punish perpetrators, while the Code of Criminal 
Procedure was amended to include harsher punishments, although enforcement of the law 
continues to be problematic. It has created specialized protection cells for women and 
children in all courts of first instance, although the cells are reportedly insufficiently 
resourced and do not operate optimally. The Government adopted a national strategy on 
violence against women, and sponsors centres that provide victims with assistance. The 
Tamkine programme, a joint Government, United Nations and the Spanish Cooperation 
initiative, is considered a good practice in Morocco. It was formulated in the context of the 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework for Morocco (2007-2011), and 
responds to Millennium Development Goal 3. It aims to protect women and girls from all 
forms of violence and to empower them. A request has been submitted to the new 
Government to extend the Programme and its benefits to victims. 
</p>
<p>78. To close gaps in legal protection on violence against women, in early 2010, a bill on 
violence against women was submitted to the Secretariat g&#233;n&#233;ral du gouvernement. In April 
</p>

</p>
<p> 25 Enqu&#234;te nationale sur la pr&#233;valence de la violence &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard des Femmes, Haut-Commissariat au Plan, 
Rabat, 10 January 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>2011, another bill on domestic violence was submitted to the Justice, Legislation and 
Human Rights Committee by the Istiqlal Parliamentary Group. The first bill is still with the 
Government, which informed the Working Group that it is convening a committee to 
review it, without specifying a clear timeline. The status of the second bill is unclear. 
</p>
<p>79. Some civil society organizations that provides victims with assistance expressed 
concern that the Government was not doing enough and had shifted much of its 
responsibility to act with due diligence to address violence against women on to them, 
including to establish and maintain shelters and provide remedy to victims. They stated that 
they did not have the means to adequately address the problem nor could they stand in for 
the Government. 
</p>
<p>80. In the opinion of the Working Group, accelerated, comprehensive measures should 
be adopted to eliminate all forms of violence against women. It notes that the bills in 
circulation may be brought together in a comprehensive law on violence against women to 
reflect the most current understanding of all forms of violence against women and ways of 
preventing, protecting and remedying violations.26 It recalls that the Committee against 
Torture urged Morocco to enact a law as soon as possible on violence against women and 
girls in order to ensure that any form of violence against women constitutes a criminal 
offence, and to amend its Criminal Code to ensure that marital rape is criminalized and that 
criminal proceedings against rapists are not terminated if they marry their victims.27 It notes 
that existing laws that are invoked in relation to violence against women need to be 
reviewed in order to ascertain ways of ensuring greater protection for victims of violence. 
Civil society organizations working to combat violence against women in Morocco, and 
actors such as the National Human Rights Council and its regional commissions, could 
usefully contribute to elaborating a comprehensive law on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>81. The Working Group notes that the effectiveness of the specialized protection cells 
for women and children need to be reinforced, in line with a result-based framework. It 
recognizes the importance of such initiatives as the Tamkine programme in linking 
women&#8217;s human rights and development, but finds that their continuity and sustainability 
</p>
<p>are not secured. It is of the view that the Government must act with due diligence to prevent 
violations, protect persons at risk, investigate and prosecute perpetrators, and provide 
assistance and remedy to victims, with the support of civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Working Group identified a number of good practices relating to the elimination 
of laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory in terms of implementation 
or impact, and other good practices that have been important in advancing equality and 
women&#8217;s rights in Morocco. 
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group views the legal reforms of the past decade, the Constitution, 
which represents the supreme law of the land, its provisions on equality and women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights, and the removal of reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women to be good practices that lay a solid foundation for 
much greater progress. These advances are significant because they are an expression of the 
leadership and political will of the Head of State and action by the Government, and the 
</p>
<p>  
 26 Joint written statement of the Advocates for Human Rights and Global Rights to the Committee 
</p>
<p>against Torture at its forty-seventh session; available from 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/cats47.htm. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>result of the work of civil society and women&#8217;s rights organizations. In the opinion of the 
Working Group, this has contributed to the high level of gender awareness in Moroccan 
society, which was observed from the national to the grass-roots level in many Government 
agencies and civil society organizations. Together, advocates in Government and civil 
society have achieved a decade of progress, proving that, with sustained political will of 
national leaders and the active role of civil society, formal equality is attainable, even 
though substantive equality takes longer. 
</p>
<p>84. The Working Group regards the institutionalization of the active role of civil society 
in the context of participatory democracy as a good practice. In the new Constitution, 
women&#8217;s rights organizations, as part of civil society, have the right to present legislative 
motions and petition the authorities at both the national and regional levels. A ministry in 
charge of relations with Parliament and civil society has been created, and no less than four 
articles of the Constitution (arts. 12, 13, 14 and 15) provide for the relationship between 
civil society, the authorities and elected institutions. There are reportedly 400,000 non-
governmental organizations in Morocco, of which many have made important contributions 
to Moroccan society and women&#8217;s human rights, and they stand to benefit from their new 
</p>
<p>constitutionally guaranteed roles. 
</p>
<p>85. The Working Group takes note of the transformative approach adopted by the 
gender budgeting initiative and, on this basis, considers this a good practice in securing the 
redistribution of resources and power between men and women. The gender-sensitive 
budgeting approach permits, inter alia, systematic analyses of inequalities that hinder 
development and provides opportunities to take remedial actions. It anchors accountability 
in overall policy processes, and translates policy commitments and legal obligations into 
outcome-focused financial allocations that contribute to the elimination of discrimination 
and the promotion of equality and human rights. The Ministry of Economy and Finance 
prepares a comprehensive annual gender budgeting report that assesses the impact of the 
budget on segments of the population, and on women in particular. Both the gender 
budgeting report for 2012 and the organic law proposal on finances for 2012 will be 
presented to Parliament for discussion and adoption. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Morocco has enjoyed a decade of progress on democracy and human rights. 
The Working Group heard almost unanimous appreciation of the efforts of the King 
</b></p>
<p><b>and positive feedback from a wide range of stakeholders on the reforms. In the areas 
</b></p>
<p>of equality and women&#8217;s human rights, the past decade has yielded progress on de 
</p>
<p><b>jure equality, while efforts continue to secure both de jure and de facto equality. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution embodies a legal, political and institutional framework that is a solid 
</b></p>
<p><b>foundation for consolidating existing achievements in equality, further advancement 
</b></p>
<p><b>of critical reforms to overcome remaining gaps, the prevention of new forms of 
</b></p>
<p>discrimination against women, and the strengthening of women&#8217;s meaningful and 
</p>
<p><b>effective participation in all fields of life </b>&#8211;<b> including political and public life - as equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>citizens. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The reforms in Morocco are widely appreciated, but numerous women leaders 
are still deeply concerned </b>that the gains of the past decade in equality and women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>rights in Morocco could be reversed and further progress could be impeded. There is 
</b></p>
<p><b>great expectation that the new Government will safeguard and build on the gains of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the past decade and ensure that the recent reforms finally allow Moroccan women to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoy their human rights in equality. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>88.<b> The Working Group makes the recommendations below to improve equality 
and non-</b>discrimination, and greater protection and promotion of women&#8217;s human 
</p>
<p><b>rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Measures to improve legal protection and the institutional and policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Align all domestic laws with international human rights treaties to which 
</b></p>
<p><b>it is State party, and amend or repeal remaining discriminatory provisions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic laws; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Withdraw all remaining declarations on and its reservation to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular its declarations on articles 2 and 15 (4); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Sign and ratify or accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and ratify the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disappearance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) </b>Close gaps in legal protection of women&#8217;s human rights and for groups 
</p>
<p><b>in need of specific protection, including domestic and migrant workers, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that vulnerable groups of women benefit from equal protection of the law. The bills on 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against women and domestic violence should be reviewed in the light of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>concluding observations of the Committee against Torture. The Penal Code, which is 
</b></p>
<p><b>under amendment, should be reviewed for compliance with international principles, 
</b></p>
<p><b>norms and standards, and adopted. Its article 475 and 490 should be repealed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Initiate a comprehensive review of the implementation of all laws with 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions affecting women and girls, including but not limited to the Family Code, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Nationality Code, and the Penal and Labour Codes. The review should ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>active participation of civil society organizations, including those that have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring court rulings on cases of early marriage and polygamy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Compile evidence-based information on the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p>State&#8217;s due diligence obligations to prevent, prohibit and punish violations of 
</p>
<p><b>international norms on equality and non-</b>discrimination, and to ensure women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>access to affordable, accessible and timely remedies, including judicial remedies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach to the drafting of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing and organic laws pertaining to the institutions mandated by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution in order to ensure coherence and consistency across all institutions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in applying the principle of gender equality and to achieve the goals of 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality between men and women, in compliance with international standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Coordination between the Government, the National Human Rights Council, civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society and other partners should aim at achieving effective implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutional provisions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Accelerate the establishment of the authority for parity and the fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against all forms of discrimination against women as an apex institution in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consolidate the gains already achieved in equality and the elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination against women. The institution should evaluate progress and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remaining challenges, and propose and implement actions to further progress. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should ensure an open and broad process of consultations with all </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant stakeholders, building on the work of the National Human Rights Council, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ensure that the authority cooperates with it; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Replicate the notable progress in gender mainstreaming and gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>budgeting in Government offices at the national level to regional, provincial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communal levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Endorse and implement the Government agenda for equality for 2011-
</b></p>
<p><b>2015. All policies and programmes with equality and non-discrimination aims should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be evaluated regularly to ensure that they are achieving these objectives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Take further measures to raise awareness of and train all justice sector 
</b></p>
<p>personnel and units in the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations, and th<b>eir 
</b></p>
<p><b>status and application in the domestic legal order. In addition, the Ministries of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Interior, Justice, and Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development are 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to ensure greater awareness of all aspects of violence against women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to integrate information on effectively preventing and responding to gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence into training programmes for the police and justice, legal and social sectors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Harness education, media and other tools to increase legal awareness 
</b></p>
<p><b>and knowledge, including on how to obtain legal and other forms of remedy for 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of human rights and to combat cultural and societal impediments to 
</b></p>
<p>equality and women&#8217;s human rights in Morocco;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Consider requesting technical assistance from the United Nations in 
</b></p>
<p>order to strengthen awareness of and implementation of the State&#8217;s international legal 
</p>
<p>obligations, including on equality and women&#8217;s human rights, building on the 
</p>
<p><b>commitment of Morocco to cooperate with all United Nations bodies.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Working Group recommends that the National Human Rights Council and 
other independent national institutions: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Enhance their proactive measures to address discrimination against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in law and in practice as integral parts of human rights protection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion and good governance, including by independent human rights monitoring 
</b></p>

<p><b>of discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Measures to advance participation in political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Accelerate the drafting of the organic laws delineating the conditions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>modalities for all citizens, women and men, to exercise their right to present motions 
</b></p>
<p><b>in legislative matters and petitions to public powers; these laws should aim to include

</b></p>
<p><b>increase the numbers of women in elected positions at the national and local levels so 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they meet international standards; national lists that reserve a certain number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>seats for women should be preserved and quotas increased. Women should be able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>present themselves for re-election on national lists. Increased quotas that meet 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards should be applied in local elections; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(c) Review the representation of women in the national cabinet in order to
