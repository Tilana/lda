<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/3.</b> <b>Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions  
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right 
</p>
<p>to life, liberty and security of person, and the relevant provisions of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Having regard</i> to the legal framework of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, including the provisions contained in 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/72 of 5 March 1992 and 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 47/136 of 18 December 1992,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Welcoming </i>the universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 
</p>
<p>1949, which alongside human rights law provide an important framework of 
</p>
<p>accountability in relation to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>  <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006,<b>  
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the 
</p>
<p>Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her 
</p>
<p>duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> <i>Mindful</i> of all relevant General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>resolutions on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in particular Commission 
</p>
<p>resolution 2004/37 of 19 April 2004 and Assembly resolution 61/173 of 19 December 
</p>
<p>2006,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>            <i>Acknowledging</i> that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions are crimes 
</p>
<p>under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> of the need for effective action to combat and to eliminate the 
</p>
<p>abhorrent practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which represents a 
</p>
<p>flagrant violation of the inherent right to life, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Dismayed</i> that, in a number of countries, impunity, the negation of justice, 
</p>
<p>continues to prevail and often remains the main cause of the continued occurrence of 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>            1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> <i>once again</i> all extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions, in all their forms, that continue to take place throughout the world; 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of relevant special procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Council, in particular the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions, in their key role as early warning mechanisms in preventing the crime of 
</p>
<p>genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and encourages the relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures, within their mandates, to cooperate towards this end; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary 
</p>
<p>or arbitrary executions is brought to an end and that they take effective action to combat 
</p>
<p>and eliminate the phenomenon in all its forms; 
</p>
<p><b>  
</b></p>
<p>4. Reiterates the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
</p>
<p>investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, </p>

<p>to identify and bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right of every person 
</p>
<p>to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal 
</p>
<p>established by law, to grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the 
</p>
<p>victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial 
</p>
<p>measures, in order to bring an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such 
</p>
<p>executions, as stated in the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of 
</p>
<p>Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions;  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5. Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions (A/HRC/8/3), as well as the recommendations made in 
</p>
<p>previous years, and invites States to give them due consideration;  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Commends</i> the important role the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions plays towards eliminating extrajudicial, summary or 
</p>
<p>arbitrary executions and encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue, within the 
</p>
<p>framework of his or her mandate, to collect information from all concerned, to respond 
</p>
<p>effectively to information that comes before him or her, to follow up on communications 
</p>
<p>and country visits and to seek the views and comments of Governments and to reflect 
</p>
<p>them, as appropriate, in the elaboration of his or her reports;  
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>7.        <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out his or her mandate: <b>                
</b></p>

</p>
<p>the General Assembly, and to draw the attention of the Council to serious situations of 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that warrant immediate attention or where 
</p>
<p>early action might prevent further deterioration; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> </p>

<p>(b) To continue to draw the attention of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to serious situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that warrant

</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>(d) To enhance further his or her dialogue with Governments, as well as to 
</p>
<p>follow up on recommendations made in reports after visits to particular countries;  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(e)  To continue monitoring the implementation of existing international 
</p>
<p>standards on safeguards and restrictions relating to the imposition of capital punishment, 
</p>

</p>
