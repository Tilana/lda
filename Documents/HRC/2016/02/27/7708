</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report was prepared in accordance with General Assembly resolution

by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Optional Protocol), and requested the Secretary-

note complements the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the Fund, 
submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session (A/68/281). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Special Fund 
</b></p>

help finance the implementation of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
following a visit to a State party to the Optional Protocol, as well as education programmes 
of national preventive mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. It receives voluntary earmarked contributions from Governments, intergovernmental 
and non-governmental organizations and other private or public entities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Management of the Special Fund

<p><b> D. Eligibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>5. Applications may be submitted by State institutions of those States parties visited by 
the Subcommittee and who have agreed to the publication of the Subcommittee report, and 
the national preventive mechanisms of these States parties. Furthermore, applications may 
also be submitted by national human rights institutions compliant with the principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (Paris Principles) and by non-governmental organizations, if the proposed projects 
are to be implemented in cooperation with eligible States parties and/or national preventive 
mechanisms. Only applications relating to recommendations contained in those 
Subcommittee visit reports that have been published in accordance with article 16,
