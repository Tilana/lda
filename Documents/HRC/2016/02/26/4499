<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Kenya was held at the 7th meeting, on 6 May 2010. The delegation of Kenya 
was headed by The Honourable Mutula Kilonzo, Minister for Justice, National Cohesion 
and Constitutional Affairs. At its 11th meeting, held on 10 May 2010, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Kenya. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kenya: Bangladesh, Egypt and Mexico. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of  Kenya: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

</footnote>/8/KEN/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">4. Denmark was concerned that the Government had yet to fully implement the 
recommendations of the Waki Commission and of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial 
killings. It asked how the Government intended to deal with the perpetrators of grave human 
rights violations. Denmark inquired about measures to eradicate the torture and ill treatment 
of detainees, and requested information about the implementation of the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people following his 2007 visit. 
Denmark made recommendations. 
</footnote>/8/KEN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Kenya through 
the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the Kenyan delegation stated that the report had been formulated and 
validated through wide consultations involving the Government, the Kenya National 
Commission on Human Rights, civil society and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>6. Kenya gained independence in 1963 and had been a constitutional multi-party 
democracy since 1991. There were three arms of the Government: the President was head of 
the executive, and the unicameral legislature consisted of the National Assembly, while the 
judiciary was an independent arm of the Government. 
</p>
<p>7. The primary sources of the laws of Kenya included the Constitution, Acts of 
Parliament and other specific pre-independence Acts, African customary law and Islamic 
law.  
</p>
<p>8. Kenya had a long-term plan, Kenya Vision 2030, to guide its development agenda, 
and the first medium-term plan was under implementation. Among the priority areas under 
implementation were projects aimed at national healing and reconciliation, as well as 
economic reconstruction, with an emphasis on equity; the creation of additional 
employment opportunities, especially for young people; and the attainment of gender 
balance. 
</p>
<p>9. Chapter V of the Constitution provided for fundamental rights and freedoms, 
without discrimination, subject to respect for the rights of others and for the public interest. </p>


<p>The High Court had inherent jurisdiction in cases involving violations of fundamental rights 
and was vested with wide powers in that regard. Rights could also be invoked as part of the 
ordinary court procedure. 
</p>
<p>10. Parliament had adopted many laws to implement those constitutional rights, as well 
as those set out in international and regional human rights instruments ratified by Kenya. It 
had also established institutions to ensure their implementation, such as the National 
Commission on Gender and Development and the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission. 
</p>
<p>11. Other institutions dealt with human rights, such as the Kenya National Commission 
on Human Rights and the Public Complaints Standing Committee, as well as transitional 
mechanisms set up to address human rights violations committed after the 2007 presidential 
elections, including the Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence (the Waki 
Commission). 
</p>
<p>12. Kenya was party to most of the core international and regional human rights 
instruments. International instruments were integrated into domestic law through a single 
law or several laws.  
</p>
<p>13. Among achievements in the area of safeguarding human rights, Kenya specifically 
referred to the following: the 2006 Witness Protection Act,  recently amended and 
operationalized; a de facto moratorium on the death penalty,  in force since 1987, with  the 
president recently having commuted 3,<footnote name="9">3. Nigeria commended Kenya for having engaged in broad consultation in the process 
of preparing its national report and for its development agenda, aimed at becoming a 
middle-income country. It was encouraged by the country&#8217;s incorporation of a substantial 
number of ratified international human rights instruments into its domestic legislation. </footnote>53 death sentences to life imprisonment while 
initiating a national reflection process on the issue; the revamping of the Kenya Prison 
Service with a view to guaranteeing relevant international standards; and the enactment of 
the Political Parties Act. 
</p>
<p>14. Kenya had various national anti-poverty programmes, including the Economic 
Stimulus Programme 2009, the &#8220;Kazi Kwa Vijana&#8221; (employment for young people) 
programme and the Constituency Development Fund. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to universal free primary education, school enrolment was on the 
increase, as well as the rate of transition from primary to secondary education. Measures 
were being taken to assist the most vulnerable children and children with special needs. 
</p>

<p>21. Key national priorities included the constitutional review process and the judicial 
and police reforms. Since 2003, Kenya had expressed its commitment to addressing 
impunity for human rights violations as well as economic crimes. In July 2009, a Truth 
Justice and Reconciliation Commission had been appointed to that end.   
</p>
<p>22. Ethnicity remained highly politicized, and the 2008 National Cohesion and 
Integration Act outlawed discrimination on ethnic grounds, through the operational National 
Cohesion and Integration Commission.  
</p>
<p>23. Enhancing security was a major concern, and administrative and institutional 
reforms were ongoing. Poverty remained a major impediment to the meeting of basic needs, 
particularly for women and children. Efforts were being focused on universal primary 
education, access to basic health and expanded productive capacity in agriculture. 
</p>
<p>24. The Environmental Policy Framework Paper, aimed at tightening environmental 
management, policy and legislation, had commenced.  
</p>
<p>25. Kenya was committed to working closely with the special procedures, as 
demonstrated by the visit of six special rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>26. Kenya welcomed assistance in building capacity sufficient to develop appropriate 
human rights indices and in the operationalization of the new constitution. 
</p>
<p>27. Despite all the challenges it faced, Kenya was committed to the promotion and 
protection of human rights at the national and international levels. Kenya had finalized the 
development of a National Policy and Action Plan for Human Rights so as to rationally 
establish human rights goals and priorities and link human rights to the national planning 
and development agenda. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>28. During the interactive dialogue, 55 delegations made statements. Twenty-two 
additional statements, which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to 
time constraints, will be posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when 
available.1 Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the 
present report. Many delegations welcomed the comprehensive national report, which had 
been formulated through a consultative process involving all relevant stakeholders and the 
commitment of Kenya to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>29. Burkina Faso welcomed the fact that Kenya was a party to most of the core human 
rights instruments. It noted with satisfaction achievements related to human rights 
protection, including the establishment of legislative guarantees, the institutional framework 
and its cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. It referred to difficulties 
persisting in terms of food security and protecting the rights of minorities and marginalized 
groups, and encouraged the pursuit of legislative and institutional reforms to improve 
human rights in those areas with the support of OHCHR. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>30. India felt encouraged by Kenya&#8217;s policy efforts, particularly the first medium-term

empowerment. It appreciated the Women Enterprise Fund and the Government&#8217;s pledge to 
allocate additional resources to it. Egypt made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Algeria congratulated Kenya on its Vision 2030, aimed at providing a high quality 
of life and promoting economic, social and cultural rights. It noted Kenya&#8217;s policy aimed at 
the swift resettlement of persons internally displaced as a result of the post-election 
violence. It sought information about national reconciliation initiatives and their impact on

peace, stability and justice. Djibouti welcomed the Children&#8217;s Act and noted the significant 
steps taken to combat impunity. It referred to the ongoing police and prison reforms, the 
witness protection programme, the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act and the 
moratorium on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>35. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya noted that Kenya had endeavoured to protect human 
rights through the Constitution and the creation of human rights and transitional 
mechanisms. It noted national programmes to combat poverty and to ensure free primary 
education and access to health-care services. It referred to the improvement of production 
capacities in agriculture and to the rehabilitation of arid and semi-arid areas. Child labour 
was a major challenge, and children continued to be victims of trafficking and exploitation. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Slovakia commended Kenya, notably for a de facto moratorium on the death 
penalty. Slovakia referred to the concerns expressed by the Committee against Torture 
regarding prison conditions in 2008, by the Committee on the Rights of the Child about 
instances in which children had been treated as adult offenders and limited progress in 
establishing a functional juvenile justice system outside Nairobi, and by a number of treaty 
bodies about genital mutilation. Slovakia welcomed the introduction of free primary and 
free secondary education. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Cuba noted that Kenya had achieved socio-economic development since 
independence despite the unjust international economic order, the impact of the 
international crisis and increasing planetary challenges for humankind. It highlighted 
programmes to combat poverty, particularly job creation measures, food aid provision and 
increased food production. Primary education was universal and free, and enrolment rates 
had increased. Cuba noted measures regarding HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, malaria, 
progress in adequate housing, and the rights of workers and children. Cuba made a 
recommendation.  
</p>
<p>38. Turkey commended Kenya for its efforts to review the Constitution, and the 
establishment of the National Commission on Human Rights, the Public Complaints 
Standing Committee and the Constituency Development Fund. It welcomed the Kenya </p>


<p>Vision 2030 programme. Turkey noted that the maternal and infant mortality rates had 
remained high. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Bolivia acknowledged Kenya&#8217;s Vision 2030, encouraging the inclusion of economic, 
social and cultural rights in order to improve living standards. It noted efforts to alleviate 
poverty through the promotion of employment and productive activities, and it encouraged 
Kenya to ensure food security. Free education had led to overcrowded schools and reduced 
quality. Information about the implementation of the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on indigenous peoples was sought. Bolivia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>40. Botswana appreciated Kenya&#8217;s commitment to improving human rights, including 
through the witness protection programme, National Vision 2030 and programmes relating 
to children&#8217;s rights. It hoped that Kenya would benefit from cooperation with the United 
Nations human rights system. Botswana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Spain recognized the democratic progress that Kenya had made by reviewing the 
Constitution. It invited Kenya to hold consultations with relevant communities and civil 
society in order to develop programmes aimed at ensuring adequate housing for all. Spain 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. Morocco acknowledged the duration and scope of Kenya&#8217;s Vision 2030, allowing 
for the promotion of all manner of rights, including national reconciliation, employment and 
the just and equitable development of all regions. The contribution made by the &#8220;Kazi Kwa 
Vijana&#8221; programme to the fight against poverty as well as the objective of the Constituency 
Development Fund were recognized. Morocco welcomed the constitutional and judicial 
reforms. It made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>43. Niger welcomed the formulation of Kenya&#8217;s Vision 2030 and the establishment of 
the national human rights commission in conformity with the Paris Principles. Niger made 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>44. The United States of America noted with satisfaction the establishment of a police 
reform commission and asked about the progress achieved. It remained concerned that the 
police continued to kill, arbitrarily arrest and extort bribes and failed to observe the due 
process of law, and that the Government had not fully implemented recommendations of the 
Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence. It urged that Parliament amend the 
Witness Protection Act to improve the mechanism for the protection of individuals 
testifying against human rights abuses. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. The head of the Kenyan delegation thanked delegations for their encouraging 
comments. Kenya was in the process of ratifying the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and had 
ratified ILO Convention No. 143, on Migrant Workers. Kenya had laws that protected the 
rights of migrant workers and their families, as demonstrated by the Employment Act of 
2007. The International Organization for Migration was supporting Kenya in that regard. 
</p>
<p>46. Concerning the employment of persons with disabilities, the Persons with 
Disabilities Act required employers to reserve 5 per cent of their employment opportunities 
for persons with disabilities. It also prohibited discrimination by employers and required 
them to provide reasonable accommodation for such persons. Further, the law provided for 
tax incentives for the employers of persons with disabilities. 
</p>

<p>48. Regarding gender-based violence, the following measures had been taken. A 
taskforce had been established on the operationalization of the Sexual Offences Act 2006, 
which had developed regulations and a sexual offences manual for the training of 
investigators and police officers. Gender desks at police stations and a gender-based 
violence recovery centre had been established. Between 2005 and 2009, there had been a 
11.<footnote name="5">8. Mexico noted Kenya&#8217;s constitutional reform and its remaining challenges due to, 
inter alia, poverty, institutional and political instability and the persistence of harmful and 
discriminatory policies. It acknowledged measures to increase the age of criminal </footnote> per cent decrease in the number of persons reported as having committed offences 
against morality. Finally, a national framework on gender-based violence had been 
developed in 2009. Gender-based violence had also received great attention during the post-
election violence. 
</p>
<p>49. The Government of Kenya had been committed to the abolition of the death penalty, 
but there was widespread public support for its retention, as had recently been observed 
during the constitutional review. Kenya was working with the Kenya National Commission 
on Human Rights to create awareness of public support for abolition.  
</p>
<p>50. With regard to same-sex relationships, there had been serious intolerance because of 
cultural beliefs and overwhelming opposition to the decriminalization of such relationships, 
as observed during the constitutional review process. However, the Government did not 
support discrimination in terms of access to services. 
</p>
<p>51. Kenya was working hard to achieve food security, and assistance in that area would 
be welcome, particularly in view of climate change. 
</p>
<p>52. Kenya attached great importance to police reform and thanked the United Kingdom, 
Sweden and other countries for their support. 
</p>
<p>53. The International Criminal Court had been authorized to investigate post-election 
violence in Kenya, and the Prosecutor was due to commence an investigation. Despite the 
investigations and prosecutions, Kenya&#8217;s ultimate goal was to seek reconciliation; hence the 
establishment of the National Commission on Integration. 
</p>
<p>54. Kenya was reviewing the minimum age of criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>55. Indonesia welcomed Kenya&#8217;s intention to review the Constitution to provide for the 
explicit protection of economic, social and cultural rights and the improved protection of 
vulnerable groups. It acknowledged the establishment of Kenya&#8217;s National Commission on 
Human Rights and the importance of Vision 2030 for Kenya&#8217;s advancement. Despite 
increased enrolment rates owing to free and compulsory education, a lack of access for 
children from poor households was noted. Indonesia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56. Belgium welcomed Kenya&#8217;s commitment, set out in Vision 2030, to the 
establishment of a political system promoting the rule of law and all rights and freedoms. 
Noting the delegation&#8217;s comments on the death penalty, it stated that that penalty 
undermined human dignity. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings had 
castigated Kenyan police forces and judicial authorities and had confirmed that human 
rights defenders were being harassed by law enforcement officials. Belgium inquired about 
police reforms. It made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>57. China appreciated the Vision 2030 anti-poverty programme, the 2009 economic 
stimulus package and the strengthening of the rule of law. It noted progress made in 
protecting the right to health, social protection and education. China expressed confidence 
that, with sustained efforts, Kenya would make progress in economic and social areas and in 
the promotion of human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>responsibility and to introduce alternative means of juvenile detention. Mexico made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. Malaysia noted that Kenya had endeavoured to undertake wide-ranging institutional 
and administrative reforms to promote and protect human rights. It referred to the 
development agenda and Vision 2030, aimed at a democratic and free society, and noted 
Kenya&#8217;s readiness to work with human rights mechanisms. Malaysia made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. Slovenia commended Kenya for the adoption of the proposed constitution and 
cooperation with the International Criminal Court. Slovenia expressed concern about the 
reported excessive use of force by police, systematic discrimination against women, the 
absence of legislation regarding violence against women, the continuation of the practice of 
female genital mutilation, and large numbers of street children. It asked about measures 
taken to end impunity and promote gender equality and non-discrimination. Slovenia 
appreciated the high school enrolment rate. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Ireland welcomed Kenya&#8217;s commitment to cooperating with the International 
Criminal Court, noting concerns regarding the protection of witnesses and human rights 
defenders. It inquired about intentions to make the de facto moratorium on the death penalty 
a legal moratorium. Access to education remained of concern, despite free primary 
education. Information was sought about programmes concerning children with special 
needs. Ireland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>62. Netherlands noted that Kenya was facing human rights challenges. It inquired about 
measures to address the perceived gap between policy and practice in combating corruption 
and protecting witnesses. It requested information about the implementation of proposed 
reforms under the Kenya National Reconciliation Accord and measures to make same-sex 
relationships more acceptable in society. Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Sweden expressed concerns about reported impunity for crimes, notably those 
related to violence following the 2007 elections. It noted the reports of human rights 
violations and threats against human rights defenders. Sweden asked about measures taken 
to protect the population from acts of violence and end impunity, and to strengthen and 
implement existing legislation aimed at protecting human rights defenders. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>

<p>there had been increasing concern about the human rights situation of a large number of 
Somalis. It noted achievements in terms of promoting social and economic rights, in 
particular the right to education and health. Somalia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>68. Austria welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death penalty and legislative 
measures to reform the police and improve witness protection. It remained concerned at the 
wider context of the rule of law, including weak institutions, systemic corruption, police 
violence, an ineffective judiciary and acts of retaliation against witnesses cooperating with 
special procedures. Austria made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. Uruguay highlighted Kenya&#8217;s efforts in the area of human rights protection, 
including the adoption of Vision 2030. Uruguay encouraged Kenya to continue efforts to 
implement international human rights instruments. It appreciated the self-critical approach 
of Kenya to its record in protecting children&#8217;s rights and highlighted progress in refraining 
from the use of the death penalty. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Singapore noted the challenges and constraints faced by Kenya, including with 
regard to poverty and inequality, governance, the rule of law and corruption. It was 
encouraged by the enhancement of the policy environment for advancing human rights, and 
it recognized Kenya Vision 2030. Singapore supported Kenya in capacity-building for 
development. It noted the National Cohesion and Integration Act 2008, aimed at addressing 
the problem of negative ethnicity.   
</p>
<p>71. Brazil welcomed efforts concerning the right to food. It highlighted the importance 
of measures like the integration of smallholder farming production with school feeding and 
the provision of credit and insurance for local producers, and inquired about challenges and 
required assistance. With respect to domestic violence, low complaint numbers and the 
absence of legislative provisions remained of concern. It proposed the establishment of 
specialized entities to protect women and the training of law enforcement officials on the 
investigation and prosecution of sexual violence against children, child prostitution and 
trafficking. Brazil made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>72. The Czech Republic expressed appreciation for Kenya&#8217;s participation in the 
universal periodic review. It acknowledged the existence of legislation prohibiting female 
genital mutilation. It made recommendations. 
</p>

situation. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>74. France inquired about the objectives of mechanisms created to overcome the impact 
of the 2007 electoral violence. It was concerned that those responsible for electoral violence 
had not been identified and that many witnesses and human rights defenders had been 
killed. It expressed concern about the delay in establishing a credible ad hoc local tribunal. 
France welcomed progress regarding women rights. However, violence and discrimination 
against women, in particular female genital mutilation, remained widespread. France made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Azerbaijan noted with satisfaction that Kenya was party to almost all core human 
rights instruments and was considering accession to the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. It 
welcomed the adoption of the Kenya Vision 2030 programme. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations.

commended reform initiatives and efforts to address the issue of witness protection. Japan 
made recommendations. 
</p>

sustained economic growth and to build a just and cohesive society and a democratic 
political system. It acknowledged the universal primary education policy and the adoption

women, such as the Women Enterprise Fund, it sought information about further steps 
intended.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>103.3. <b>Prevent extrajudicial killings and ensure compensation and justice for

<p>103.4  <b>Immediately implement all the recommendations put forward by the 
Waki Commission and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings 
(Denmark);

same-sex activity between consenting adults (Czech Republic)<i>; </i>repeal all 
legislative provisions which criminalize sexual activity between consenting 
adults (United States of America); decriminalize homosexuality by abrogating 
the legal provisions currently punishing sexual relations between consenting 
individuals of the same sex, and subscribe to the December 2008 General 
Assembly Declaration on sexual orientation and human rights (France); </b></p>


<p>103.6. <b>Support the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, and devote attention to the recommendations made by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous peoples, after her visit to the country (Mexico); 
</b></p>
<p>103.7. <b>Further strengthen relations with the indigenous communities with a 
view to promoting and protecting their rights and assisting them in their 
development initiatives (Malaysia).</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.1 above, Kenya indicated 
that the Kenyan public had overwhelmingly rejected the abolition of the death penalty 
for the most serious crimes. The Government, in collaboration with the Kenya 
National Commission on Human Rights and other stakeholders, continued to raise 
public awareness regarding the abolition of the death penalty.</b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.2 above, Kenya wished to 
clarify that it did not impose the death penalty on children, and therefore there was no 
need for such a recommendation. Regarding the issue of an official moratorium, the 
position remained that elaborated under recommendation 103.1.</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.3 above, Kenya indicated 
that, while it was committed to preventing extrajudicial killings and ensuring 
compensation and justice for the families of victims through due process, it did not 
agree with linking that issue to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, whose shortcomings 
had already been pointed out by the Government.</b> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>With regard to the recommendation in paragraph 103.4 above, Kenya 
indicated that the use of the term &#8220;all&#8221; was not acceptable, as it was not feasible; 
however, most of the recommendations of the Waki Commission Report were being 
implemented and aspects of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report had given rise to issues of 
concern.</b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b>With regard to recommendations in paragraph 103.5 above, Kenya indicated 
that same-sex unions were culturally unacceptable in Kenya.</b> 
</p>
<p>109. <b>With regard to recommendations in paragraphs 103.6 and 103.7 above, Kenya 
indicated that the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; was not applicable, as all Kenyans of 
African descent were indigenous to Kenya. However, the Government recognized the 
vulnerabilities of minorities/marginalized communities.</b> 
</p>
<p>110. <b>All conclusions and/or recommendations set out in the present report reflect 
the positions of the submitting State(s) and/or the State under review. They should not
