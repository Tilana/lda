 The balance sum of $47,200 was credited to Fiji Development Bank Account.

5.4 Answering to the question raised by the Court the witness stated he cannot state for what transaction the said payments were made for the reason that the supporting vouchers were destroyed.

Receipt No. 351091 dated 23/06/2006 was tendered marked as P3 which states $47200 was received from the Plaintiff Company for the credit of the Account of Ratu Aisea C. Katonivere.

 The witness stated the said payment was for a loan account of Ratu Aisea it could have been an Agricultural or Home or business loan. Transaction code stated in the receipt is for a loan payment. Mortgage Document No. 36586 was tendered which was cancelled on 11th July 2006 pertaining to Title C.L.2957 Lot 54Muanikau Subdivision (L.D. 4/16/3274) where the proprietor was Ratu Aisea Cavunailoa Katonivere.

6. Analysis and assessment of damages.

6.1 Considering the evidence led before the Court, I conclude the following:

1)      
The plaintiff had given instructions to ANZ Bank to make the following payments out of the $129,798.62 from the Account of the Plaintiff

a)      
Sun Insurance $5580.

b)      
Commissioner of Inland Revenue $27718

c)      
Asco motors $49300

d)      
Fiji Development Bank $47200

6.2 The Plaintiff had claimed $129,798.62 as specific damageson the basis that the said payments were made for the benefit of the deceased Ratu Aisea Cavunailoa Katonivere.However the Plaintiff's evidence placed before this Court onlyproves the sum of $47200 was used to pay the loan of late Ratu Aisea Cavunailoa Katonivere obtained from Fiji Development Bank to discharge the Mortgage of the Crown Lease No.2957 which hadnow benefitted the Defendant who is the transferee. 

6.3 However the Plaintiff failed to establish before this Court the other payments made to Sun Insurance, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and Asco Motors werepayments made for the liabilities of the late Ratu Aisea.

6.4 In the circumstances I award special damages of $47200 to the Plaintiff.

6.5 The Plaintiff's funds were utilized to pay the loan of theDefendant as such.The Plaintiff had lost income from the said sum of $47200 since 23/06/2006 accordingly. I award interest of the rate of 6% per annum from 23/06/2006up to the date of this Judgment which is calculated as follows.

 6 x $47200 = 2832 = $7.75 per day
 100 365

 From 23/06/2006 up to 22/08/2014 = 2980 days x 7.75=$23,095

6.6 There is no any ground for this Court to use its discretion to award any General damages.
 
 Accordingly I award the Plaintiff:
 Special damages - $47200
 Interest - $23095 $70295
 
Accordingly I make the following orders.

a)      
The Defendant's are ordered to pay $70,295 as special damages.

b)      
The Defendants are ordered to pay interest as the rate of 6% per annum on $47,200 up to the date of full settlement of $70,295.00.
