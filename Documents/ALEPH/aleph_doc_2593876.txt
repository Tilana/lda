Important Information for Investors and Securityholders
Forward-Looking Statements
This communication contains “forward-looking statements”. All statements other than statements
of historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and
Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues,
earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. Forward-looking
statements are often identified by the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,”
“foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “may,” “estimate,” “outlook” and similar expressions,
including the negative thereof. The absence of these words, however, does not mean that the
statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on our current
expectations, beliefs and assumptions concerning future developments and business conditions
and their potential effect on us. While management believes that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future
developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements include failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely
manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the proposed transactions;
failure to obtain favorable opinions from counsel for each company to the effect of how
TechnipFMC Limited (to be renamed TechnipFMC plc) (“TechnipFMC”) should be treated for
U.S. tax purposes as a result of the proposed transaction; risks associated with tax liabilities, or
changes in U.S. federal or international tax laws or interpretations to which they are subject,
including the risk that the Internal Revenue Service disagrees that TechnipFMC is a foreign
corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes; risks that the new businesses will not be integrated
successfully or that the combined companies will not realize estimated cost savings, value of
certain tax assets, synergies and growth or that such benefits may take longer to realize than
expected; failure to realize anticipated benefits of the combined operations; risks relating to
unanticipated costs of integration; reductions in client spending or a slowdown in client
payments; unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in the companies’ industries;
ability to hire and retain key personnel; ability to successfully integrate the companies’
businesses; the potential impact of announcement or consummation of the proposed transaction
on relationships with third parties, including clients, employees and competitors; ability to attract
new clients and retain existing clients in the manner anticipated; reliance on and integration of
information technology systems; changes in legislation or governmental regulations affecting the
companies; international, national or local economic, social or political conditions that could
adversely affect the companies or their clients; conditions in the credit markets; risks associated
with assumptions the parties make in connection with the parties’ critical accounting estimates
and legal proceedings; and the parties’ international operations, which are subject to the risks of
currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls.
All of our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties (some of which are
significant or beyond our control) and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. You should
carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that affect the
parties’ businesses, including those described in FMC Technologies’ (“FMC Technologies”)
Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and
other documents filed from time to time by FMC Technologies and TechnipFMC with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and those described in Technip S.A.’s
(“Technip”) annual reports, registration documents and other documents filed from time to time
with the French financial markets regulator (Autorité des Marchés Financiers or the “AMF”). We
wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any of our
forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law.
No Offer or Solicitation
This communication is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities or the
solicitation of any vote in any jurisdiction pursuant to the proposed transactions or otherwise, nor
shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of
applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the
requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act and applicable European regulations. Subject to
certain exceptions to be approved by the relevant regulators or certain facts to be ascertained,
the public offer will not be made directly or indirectly, in or into any jurisdiction where to do so
would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, or by use of the mails or by any

such jurisdiction.
