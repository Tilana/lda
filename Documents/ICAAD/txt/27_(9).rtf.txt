IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT LAUTOKA
MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL MISCELLANEOUS CASE NO: HAM 263 OF 2012

BETWEEN:

JONE MASIREWA
Applicant

AND:

STATE
Respondent

Counsel : Applicant  In Person
Mr. F. Lacanivalu for the State 

Date of Ruling : 8 February 2013

BAIL RULING

[1]     
This is an application for bail filed by the Applicant above named.

[2]     
The Applicant above named submits following grounds in support of his bail application:

(a)     
 He did not sign the caution interview and charge statement;
(b)     
He was tortured;
(c)     
He is innocent;
(d)     
Have dependant de facto wife and a 7 year old child.

[3]     
The State Counsel objects for bail and submits following grounds:

(a)     
 The Applicant has two cases of similar nature before the High Court (HAC 133 of 2012 and HAC 138 of 2012);

(b)     
In HAC 133 of 2012 on the 18th September 2012 at around 11.30pm the Applicant with two others allegedly boarded a taxi, threatened the driver with a knife and robbed his items and dumped him in the boot of his own taxi;

(c)     
In HAC 138 of 2012 the Applicant together with two others allegedly broke and entered to two rooms at a Airport hotel in Nadi which was occupied by tourists stole items worth more than $8,900.00;

(d)     
The Applicant may not surrender to custody;

(e)     
Public interest and protection of the community. 

[4]     
Section 3(1) of the Bail Act states as follows:

"Every accused person has a right to be released on bail, unless it is not in the interests of justice that bail should be granted".

[5]     
Considering the application and the response filed by the Respondent State I find the Applicant alleged to have committed serious offences. In both cases the victims are very sensitive persons. Both of them raises public concern.

[6]     
I find the Applicant falls within the ambit of Section 19 of the Bail Act. Hence I find releasing the Applicant on bail is a threat to the community.

[7]     
For the reasons discussed above I find the presumption of bail is successfully rebutted hence I refuse bail.

[8]     
Application for bail is dismissed.
