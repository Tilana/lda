DELTA INTERNATIONAL OIL & GAS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Delta International Oil
& Gas Inc. (“Delta” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position
and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The
results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate
the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year end
December 31, 2015 as reported on Form 10-K, have been omitted.
2. RECEIVABLE FROM SALE OF BIDDING RIGHTS AND OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
On March 30, 2012 the Company entered into the Cooperation Agreement with PPL. Under the
Cooperation Agreement, PPL agreed to pay us $7,000,000 for certain exploration and
exploitation rights to oil and gas deposits and certain bidding rights held by Delta on the
following areas: Valle de Lerma in the province of Salta; San Salvador de Jujuy; Libertador
General San Martin in the province of Jujuy; and Selva Maria in the province of
Formosa.  Pursuant to a separate Agreement dated March 31, 2012, the Company agreed with
PPL to assign and transfer 50% of SAHF's current ownership of the Tartagal and Morillo (i.e., a
9% interest in the concession) to PPL for a purchase price of $500,000. PPL had also agreed in
an Undertaking to provide funds to the operating entities of Valle de Lerma (the San Salvador,
Libertador, and Selva Maria concessions were awarded to another party, whose bid exceeded
that of the Company for these concessions), in the aggregate amount of up to $10,000,000.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had received deposits in the amount of $4,299,891 from PPL
on account. The remainder of the proceeds was recorded as a $3,200,069 receivable from the
sale of bidding rights and oil and gas properties. As of December 31, 2014, the Company
provided a reserve for doubtful accounts of $3,200,069. Because of PPL’s payment default, the
Company has not transferred the Tartagal, and Morillo interests. The Company, however, did
incorporate High Luck Group (a subsidiary of New Times Energy) into the official UTE for Valle
de Lerma, as per PPL’s request.
On May 12, 2016, Delta signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with New Times Energy
Group for the sale of 18% of Tartagal and Morillo for US$4 million to be paid in installments. The
contract is contingent to a termination of agreements for all the agreements between Delta, PPL,
and SAHF. As of July 26, 2016, Delta, PPL, and SAHF had cancelled all of their contracts as per
the conditions set forth by the MOU signed with New Times.
3. INVESTMENTS IN MHD TECHNOLOGY
We have made an investment of $125,000 in MHD Technology Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (“MHD Tech”), for an equity position of 2,150,000 shares of common stock of MHD
Tech (approximately 6.25% of the outstanding shares in the company); this investment was made
through a separate limited liability company owned by Delta and set up specifically for this
investment. In connection with the investment, Santiago Peralta, our Interim Chief Executive
Officer and sole director, has joined the Board of Directors of MHD Tech. The investment that
Delta made into MHD Tech will be primarily for research and development purposes. A company
had been selected to run simulations on the product, but was subsequently postponed due to a
reprioritization of the company’s goals.
This investment is accounted for using the cost accounting method. The value of the investment
on the balance sheet will be shown at historical cost and will not be adjusted according to fair
market value. If there is evidence that suggests that the fair market value of the investment is
lower than the historical cost, then the investment will be written down to its new fair market
value.
6
4. POTENTIAL MANAGER BONUS
Due to the agreement reached between New Times Energy and Delta, and the commitments
made in July 2015 for a manager bonus to Alberto Mac Mullen and January 2016 for a
negotiating commission for Enrique Vidal, the Company expects to have cash disbursements
upwards of $200,000 as the payment installments come into the Company.
5. ASSET SALE
On May 12, 2016, Delta and New Times Energy reached an agreement in principle for the sale of
18% of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo. The two companies signed an MOU detailing the purchase
amount, payment terms, and conditions on both sides. The companies have a 30-day period to
reach a final agreement. Although the 30-day period has passed, Delta and New Times Energy
are working diligently at reaching a final agreement.
The total consideration for the 18% of Tartagal Oriental and Morillo is US$4,000,000. The initial
payment of US$2,000,000 will be placed in escrow at the signing and will be released when the
official transfer of interest in the properties is completed. Additionally, Delta will receive 3% of
gross revenues of production of both oil and gas in the properties until an additional US$2 million
are paid. New Times has committed to drill 3 exploratory wells in the next 15 months in Tartagal
and Morillo.
Although the terms are set in the MOU, it is not a final agreement and some items may vary from
the original agreement.
6. IMPAIRMENT OF VALLE DE LERMA CONCESSION
The oil and gas concession owned by SAHF in the Province of Salta, Argentina known as Valle
de Lerma has been impaired and has a carrying value of $0 as of June 30, 2016. The impairment
expense at June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $191,236 and zero dollars, respectively. SAHF still
holds title to the property and is in discussions with potential buyers. Even though there is
discussion with potential buyers, the property was impaired as of June 30, 2016 because there is
a likely scenario in which the property will be returned to the government for no consideration.
7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Following one of the requirements of the MOU with New Times, as of July 26, 2016, Delta,
SAHF, and PPL all signed a cancellation without further claims of all agreements related to the
2012 agreements with PPL.
As of the date of this filing, the definitive agreement for the sale of the Tartagal and Morillo
between Delta and New Times Energy is under negotiation and pending approvals of the final
form of the definitive agreement.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other
financial information included elsewhere in this report.
Certain statements contained in this report, including, without limitation, statements containing
the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects" and words of similar import, constitute "forward
looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our actual
results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of certain factors, including our ability to create, sustain, manage or forecast our growth; our
ability to attract and retain key personnel; changes in our business strategy or development
plans; competition; business disruptions; adverse publicity; and international, national and local
general economic and market conditions.
GENERAL
Delta International Oil & Gas Inc. (“Delta” or “the Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on
November 17, 1999.  Our name was changed from Delta Mutual Inc. to our present name on
October 29, 2013, by the merger with a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, where the sole
change resulting from the merger was the change of the Company’s name to Delta International
Oil & Gas Inc.  In 2003, we established business operations focused on providing environmental
and construction technologies and services.  Our operations in the Far East (Indonesia) and our
construction operations in Puerto Rico were discontinued in 2008.
Effective March 4, 2008, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests
in the parent of South American Hedge Fund LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(sometimes herein referred to as “SAHF”).  For accounting purposes, the transaction was treated
as a recapitalization of the Company as of March 4, 2008, with the parent of SAHF as the
acquirer. SAHF maintains a branch office in Argentina, where it has made investments in oil and
gas exploration and development activities.
Overview
We are an independent oil and gas company, with the SIC Code classification 1311 (oil and gas
production) for SEC filing purposes, engaged in oil and gas acquisition and exploration activities
in Argentina. Our operating policies have been to secure oil and gas properties and concessions
which are either producing economical quantities of oil and gas or which demonstrate favorable
characteristics for well “workovers” with a history of excellent production.
Since Mauricio Macri was sworn in as president on December 10, 2015, Argentina has been
going through an aggressive reform agenda. In the oil and energy sector, the President has
focused on replacing key officials in the Energy Department across the country. He is also in the
process of replacing part of the top management and board of directors at the national oil
company – YPF. Currently, the oil and natural gas prices applicable domestically are artificially
set at $67.50/bbl and up to $7.50/MCF, respectively, in order to keep exploration attractive and to
meet domestic energy needs. There are no restrictions for the payment abroad of interest,
dividends or profits, royalties and other commercial payments duly supported by the
corresponding documentation. There are presently no restrictions on foreign investment in the
capital of local corporations.
8
Investment in MHD Technology Corporation
The Company is currently evaluating prospects for investments in fields other than oil and
gas exploration and production, and we have made an initial investment in MHD
Technology Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“MHD Tech”), a company involved in
development of a technology for the transportation and desalination of water, using a
specific propulsion technology based on a 1990’s Mitsubishi magnetohydroelectric (MHD)
propelled ship and that had been deemed uneconomic until present-day. We are actively
involved in the company in the development phase of the first product. Our investment
was made in the first quarter of 2016.
Our investment was in the amount of $125,000 in for an equity position of 2,150,000 shares
of common stock of MHD Tech (approximately 6.25% of the outstanding shares in the
company); this investment was made through a separate limited liability company owned
by Delta and set up specifically for this investment. In connection with the investment,
Santiago Peralta, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and sole director, has joined the
Board of Directors of MHD Tech. The investment that Delta made into MHD Tech will be
primarily for research and development purposes. Currently, MHD Tech is working with
one of the world’s leading authorities in fluid dynamics to develop the first working
prototype. The economic viability of the product will not be confirmed until the simulation
numbers and costs are obtained.
Delta’s primary role in the company is to aid in component research and acquisition for
the “proof of concept” prototype as well as develop a communication strategy for the
virtual team to be on the same page. Following the delivery of actual product number and
costs, Delta is considering developing a revenue strategy working with another team
member.
Desalination Industry
There are currently 18,426 desalination plants operating worldwide with production
capacity of 86.8 million m3/d. This production is expected to increase to around 120 million
m3/d by 2025. Although there are over 18,000 operating plants, there are less than 30
companies that account for 80% of the operating desalination plants. This means that
even though the industry appears to be extremely fragmented, it is actually concentrated.
With the number of desalination projects in the pipeline, the company should be able to
enter the supplier network as a potential desalination pump. Over the next 20 years,
cumulative water-related infrastructure spending is expected to reach between $12 trillion
and $22 trillion.
Our Oil and Gas Investments
As of June 30, 2016, the Company, through SAHF, retained 18% of the total concession in
the carryover mode ("no cost obligations to SAHF") in the Tartagal and Morillo oil and gas
concessions located in Northern Argentina. We do not operate the Tartagal and Morillo
concession, and have a minority position in the joint venture. 9% of Tartagal and Morillo
had been sold to PPL in March 2012, but due to payment defaults, the 9% were not
transferred. Tartagal and Morillo have a carrying value of $0 because 50% of its interest
was sold for higher than the carrying cost in 2012.
9
We hold a 30.6% interest in the Valle de Lerma concession in Northern Argentina, where
the joint venture partners are Grasta SA, PetroNEXUS, High Luck Group, and REMSA.
Valle de Lerma has a carrying value of $221,880. 29.4% of the rights were sold to PPL
under the PPL Agreement and High Luck Group was included in the UTE and the
Operation Agreement as 29.4% owners and 50% liable for all expenses as requested by
PPL. However, the official government decree acknowledging High Luck Group as an
owner has not yet been made. Delta has spent about $500,000 and complied with about
$800,000 of work unit commitments in relation to Valle de Lerma of which High Luck Group
is liable for 50%. Additionally, the end of the first period for Valle de Lerma was in March
2016- which the UTE is not looking to extend. As of June 30, 2016, Valle de Lerma has
been completely impaired and holds a carrying value of $0.
The exploration terms are four years for the first period, three years for the second and
two years for the last period. Currently our ability to reopen the existing well site is
constrained by law, since the location of the well was within the city limits of Salta.
Requests made for government approval to override the existing restrictions of the
current policy have been rejected. The Company is looking to sell its full stake in Valle de
Lerma, but is still exploring all possible options.
As of May 13, 2016, Delta and New Times Energy Corporation Limited reached an
agreement for the Company’s sale of its 18% interest in Tartagal and Morillo for a total
consideration of US$4 million. There are contingencies in the agreement and the
companies have 30 days to sign a final contract. Even though 30 days since the signing of
the MOU have passed, all parties are working diligently and in good faith to reach a final
agreement and close the transaction.
Lithium Mining Property
On March 1, 2010, SAHF purchased control of 51% of the Guayatayoc project via a
partnership agreement with Oscar Chedrese and Servicios Mineros SA. The project holds
the concession for a period of 20 years for the mineral rights to 143,000 hectares with 29
mines located in the Northwest part of Argentina, south of the border with Bolivia, with
high lithium and borates brines concentration. We have performed sampling in the
property to determine the value of the property, but the results have been inconclusive.
We are seeking a purchaser for our concession interest in this property. Delta is not
expecting a sale of the lithium property within the next year due to 1) the current price of
lithium, 2) lithium’s abundance in the surrounding area, and 3) Delta’s primary focus on
other projects. The concession was completely impaired and has a carrying value of $0 as
of June 30, 2016.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED
JUNE 30, 2015
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately
$295,000, compared to net loss of approximately $ 152,000 for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The increase in the net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015 is due to: the impairment of the Valle
de Lerma concession in 2016, lower general and administrative expenses in 2016, and a
foreign exchange loss in 2015.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,
2015
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of approximately
$377,000, compared to net loss of approximately $293,000 for the six months ended June
30, 2015. The increase in the net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
the six months ended June 30, 2015 is due to: the impairment of the Valle de Lerma
concession in 2016, lower general and administrative expenses in 2016 and a foreign
exchange loss in 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
At June 30, 2016, we had a working capital surplus of approximately $386,000 compared
with a working capital surplus of approximately $697,000 at December 31, 2015.
At June 30, 2016, we had total assets of approximately $543,000 compared to total assets
of approximately $945,000 at December 31, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities in
the six months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately $181,000, as compared with net
cash used in operating activities of $263,000 in 2015; net cash used in investing activities
was approximately $125,000 in 2016 and $- in 2015; and net cash generated from financing
activities was $-0- in both years.
Effective March 30, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase and Cooperation Agreement
(the “Cooperation Agreement”) with Principle Petroleum Limited (“PPL”), headquartered
in the British Virgin Islands. Under the Cooperation Agreement, we agreed to sell to PPL,
for a price of $7,000,000 certain exploration and exploitation rights to oil and gas deposits
and certain bidding rights held by SAHF on the following areas: Valle de Lerma in the
province of Salta; San Salvador de Jujuy; Libertador General San Martin in the province of
Jujuy; and Selva Maria in the province of Formosa. The San Salvador, Libertador, and
Selva Maria concessions have since been awarded by the government to another party.
Pursuant to a separate Agreement dated March 31, 2012, we agreed with PPL to assign
and transfer 50% of SAHF's current ownership of the Tartagal and Morillo (i.e., a 9%
interest in the concession) to PPL for a purchase price of US$500,000. PPL had also
agreed in an Undertaking to provide funds to the operating entity of Valle de Lerma (and
the other concessions, if our bid had been approved) in the aggregate amount of up to US
$10,000,000. As of July 26, 2016, all contracts between PPL, SAHF, and Delta had been
cancelled with no further obligations on either side as conditioned by the MOU signed with
New Times in the second quarter of 2016.
As part of PPL’s obligations under the Cooperation Agreement, PPL made partial
payments of $2,000,000 in our 2012 first fiscal quarter, $999,979 in the second quarter and
$499,979 in the third quarter towards the full amount of $7,000,000 provided under the
Cooperation Agreement.  Both parties are working to execute the full amount of PPL’s
payment obligations as agreed. Further payments of $500,000, $50,000, $150,000, and
$99,973 were made in January 2013, July 2014, August 2014, and November 2014,
respectively. The interests in the Tartagal and Morillo, concessions have not yet been
transferred to PPL due to PPL’s payment defaults in all agreements. High Luck Group has
been included in the UTE Agreement and Operations Agreement for Valle de Lerma as per
PPL’s request under the Cooperation Agreement. On May 13, 2016, we entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding subject to final agreements to sell our interests in Tartagal
and Morillo to New Times Energy Corporation Limited. As of the date of this filing, an initial
draft of the final agreements was being edited by New Times and Delta.
Estimated 2016 Capital Requirements
In the case of the Tartagal and Morillo oil and gas properties, we have carried interests;
therefore, no further capital expenditures are required on our part.
Valle de Lerma’s target well, “La Troja,” has been deemed inside the city limits, and,
therefore, unable to be drilled. Given the concession’s limited number of other potential
“workover” drills, and the Company’s strategy to not engage in any exploratory drilling,
the cost of Valle de Lerma for 2016 is expected to be US$100,000 in canons and other
obligations. The Company is currently looking for buyers for the property.
SAHF also has “minimum expected income” tax in Argentina. In the third quarter of 2015,
SAHF spent about US$12,000 in minimum expected income tax in Argentina to bring all of
its tax positions up-to-date. Another minimum expected income tax is expected to be paid
in the third quarter of 2016 in the amount of $15,000.
In 2015, Delta considerably lowered its operating expenses and SG&As in order to look for
other opportunities for investment in the energy industry. In the oil and gas sector, the
focus is service-related while in the alternative energies sector, the focus is in water
propulsion systems and hydro-electric systems.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, and expenses, and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to oil and gas properties, intangible assets,
income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included in these financial statements. Certain amounts for
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Management believes that it is reasonably possible that the following material estimates
affecting the financial statements could happen in the coming two years:
●Reserve reports in two of the properties;
    
 ●Cash flow from exploratory drilling in two of the properties; and
    
 ●Future exploration and development costs that are carried.
NEW FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
For a summary of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company, please
refer to the notes to the financial statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued “Financial Reporting Release
No. 60 Cautionary Advice About Critical Accounting Policies” (“FRR 60”), suggesting
companies provide additional disclosures, discussion and commentary on their
accounting policies considered most critical to its business and financial reporting
requirements. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the
Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant
judgment and estimates on the part of management in the application of the policy.
The Company assesses potential impairment of its long-lived assets, which include its
property and equipment, investments, and its identifiable intangibles such as deferred
charges under the guidance of ASC 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” The Company must continually determine if a permanent impairment
of its long-lived assets has occurred and write down the assets to their fair values and
charge current operations for the measured impairment.
Investments in non-consolidated affiliates – These investments consist of the Company’s
ownership interests in oil and gas development and exploration rights in Argentina, net of
impairment losses if any.
We evaluate these investments for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are
present. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, levels of oil and gas
reserves, availability of pipeline (or other transportation) capacity and infrastructure and
management of the operations in which the investments were made.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to non-employees under ASC 718,
"Compensation-Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718").  The compensation cost of the
awards is based on the grant date fair-value of these awards and recognized over the
requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period.  The Company uses the
Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair-value of stock options issued for
compensation.
12
The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards based upon ASC 505-50,
“Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.”  ASC 505-50 requires the costs of goods
and services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be recognized
using the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity award,
whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of the equity award is determined on
the measurement date, which is the earlier of the date that a performance commitment is
reached or the date that performance is complete.  Generally, our awards do not entail
performance commitments.  When an award vests over time such that performance
occurs over multiple reporting periods, we estimate the fair value of the award as of the
end of each reporting period and recognize an appropriate portion of the cost based on
the fair value on that date.  When the award vests, we adjust the cost previously
recognized so that the cost ultimately recognized is equivalent to the fair value on the date
the performance is complete.
Item 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.
Item 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our chief executive and financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost- benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures.
As of June 30, 2016, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting
that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter to which this report relates that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a
company have been detected. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. The Company's
chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level.
