<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Lesotho was held at the 6th meeting, on 5 May 2010. The delegation of 
Lesotho was headed by the Honourable (Mrs.) Mpeo Mahase-Moiloa, Minister of Justice,  
Human Rights and the Correctional Service and of Law and Constitutional Affairs of the 
Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho. At its 10th meeting, held on 7 May 2010, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Lesotho. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Lesotho: Cameroon, Slovenia and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Lesotho: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/LSO/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Lesotho through the 
troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Lesotho introduced its national report and stated that the country 
had undergone a similar process under the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) in 
July 2009. Lesotho&#8217;s national report to the universal periodic review had been prepared 
through an integrated institutional process and in consultation with civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted that Lesotho was one of the least developed countries and one 
of the countries with the lowest official development assistance per capita. The global 
financial and economic crises had had devastating socio-economic effects. Despite the 
adverse affects, Lesotho had made major strides towards the full enjoyment of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation noted that national reports on domestic implementation had been 
submitted on ICCPR in 1999, on ICERD in 2000 and on CRC in 2001. There were 
currently draft reports on ICESCR and a periodic report on ICCPR, and every effort would 
be made to submit the report to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women before the end of 2010. 
</p>
<p>8. When examining Lesotho, the Human Rights Committee had made 
recommendations on some provisions of the Constitution that were not compatible with the </p>


<p>Covenant. In response, Lesotho had enacted laws such as the Legal Capacity of Married 
Persons Act 2006, which ruled out discrimination against women in marriage, and the 
Sexual Offences Act 2003, which addressed areas under the common law offence of rape. 
The Committee had also commented on the need to improve conditions of prisons, and the 
delegation had stated that conditions were being improved through renovations.  
</p>
<p>9. The Committee on the Rights of the Child had recommended that the Children&#8217;s 
Protection Act 1980 be brought into conformity with the principles of CRC. Consequently, 
a comprehensive children&#8217;s protection and welfare bill had recently been forwarded to 
Parliament.   
</p>
<p>10. The delegation noted that CERD had been concerned by the absence of a 
comprehensive legislative framework prohibiting acts of racial discrimination and by the 
lack of effective remedies. The Race Relations Order 1971 had then been amended to 
include provisions for the teaching of tolerance and peaceful coexistence among people of 
diverse origins.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation indicated that, in an attempt to make Parliament more responsive to 
the needs of the population, some reform measures had been introduced, and it now had 
portfolio committees that monitored ministries and facilitated people&#8217;s participation in law 
making, policy formulation and the fielding of proposals.  
</p>
<p>12. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is empowered to conduct free and fair 
elections and referendums. The delegation highlighted the fact that the IEC was 
independent and that it had organized the first National Assembly elections in 1998 and 
subsequent elections in 2002 and 2007. The delegation noted that all had been declared free 
and fair by domestic, regional and international observers. 
</p>
<p>13. The Office of the Ombudsman complemented the work of the judiciary as a 
constitutional body, mandated to investigate all allegations involving acts perpetrated by 
Government agencies. The enforcement of the Ombudsman&#8217;s recommendations was 
overseen by Parliament and was working well.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation noted that Lesotho retained the death penalty solely for the following 
offences: murder, treason and rape. However, there were appropriate safeguards. Capital 
punishment had not been carried out since 1995, and most sentences had been commuted to 
terms of life or long imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>15. Lesotho noted that it had witnessed an increase in human trafficking involving 
women and children, and that plans were under way to establish a legislative framework for 
addressing this. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation indicated that Lesotho&#8217;s achievements included high literacy rates 
and the adoption of the Mixed Member Proportional Representation Electoral Model. The 
Government had also taken steps to empower women politically; hence, the Local 
Government Act in 2004 had been amended to allocate 30 per cent of the seats in the Local 
Councils to women, and 58 per cent representation of women had actually been achieved. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding the HIV/AIDS pandemic, various efforts have been undertaken, including 
voluntary counselling and testing and the establishment of the National Aids Commission. 
An HIV/AIDS Bill is under preparation and will provide a legal framework for 
interventions. Despite resource limitations, the poor are afforded free access to available 
health services.  
</p>
<p>18. Lesotho continues to be beset by a decline in agricultural production as a result of 
soil erosion and periodic droughts. As a result, the country is experiencing a worsening 
food deficit and widening poverty and food insecurity. Despite those setbacks and negative </p>


<p>effects, the Government continues to prioritize social safety nets, such as school feeding 
and orphaned and vulnerable children&#8217;s programmes and old-age pension schemes.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation stated that the already high levels of unemployment had been 
exacerbated by the global crises. The economy was in dire straits, and economic and social 
rights would be seriously threatened unless the international community should provide 
additional support. Despite challenges, Lesotho remained committed to achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals and the Vision 2020 Strategic Framework. 
</p>
<p>20. In response to advance questions, Lesotho stated that it had maintained the death 
penalty under statutory law as a form of deterrence; the penalty had not been carried out for 
the past 15 years. The Government took note of the international trend towards the abolition 
of the death penalty. Freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment was 
guaranteed under the Constitution and was prohibited under applicable common law; and, 
in 2000, Lesotho had ratified the Convention against Torture. It provided information about 
the Police Complaints Authority and the Office of the Ombudsman, established to address 
allegations of torture in places of detention. The ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture would be considered.  
</p>
<p>21. Concerning places of detention, conditions have been improved considerably 
following the renovation of certain institutions in some districts, including the Mental 
Institution for Inmates, which is currently under construction. Nonetheless, there is still a 
need for infrastructural improvements, resources permitting.   
</p>
<p>22. The delegation noted that Lesotho adhered to the right to freely participate in public 
processions and gatherings, as well as to freedom of expression, in as much as Lesotho had 
the duty to ensure the security of the people. Through the enactment of the Public 
Processions and Meetings Bill, Lesotho was seeking to strike a balance between those two 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that in Lesotho, freedom of press flourished and there were  
about 10 privately owned radio stations and newspapers, all of which enjoyed free 
broadcasting and publishing. Independent bodies such as the Lesotho Telecommunications 
Authority, the Media Institute of Lesotho and others regulated media issues. The draft 
media policy upheld the right of freedom of expression.   
</p>
<p>24. The delegation stated that the Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Bill, inspired by the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, would be discussed during the current sitting of 
Parliament. The Government had put in place Child and Gender Protection Units at all 
police posts to respond to allegations of violence against children. A toll-free child help line 
for reporting abuse was also in place.  
</p>
<p>25. As the plight of HIV and AIDS had led to more children being orphaned, the 
Government provided payment of school fees, monthly grants and food packages to such 
orphans.  
</p>
<p>26. Concerning the protection of children in conflict with the law, the Government had 
enacted the Children&#8217;s Protection Act 1980. Rather than employing usual criminal justice 
procedures, the country had adopted the use of restorative justice. The Children&#8217;s 
Protection and Welfare Bill had further improved the child justice system.   
</p>
<p>27. The Constitution established the age of majority at 18. Lesotho was working on 
various pieces of legislation to bring them into conformity with the Constitution and 
international standards.   
</p>
<p>28. The delegation noted that, despite the existing reservation to article 2 of CEDAW, 
Lesotho had undertaken measures to ensure the elimination of discrimination against 
women, as well as gender equality, by undertaking a review of all discriminatory laws.  The </p>


<p>Child and Gender Protection Unit actively addressed issues related to gender-based 
violence.  
</p>
<p>29. The delegation referred to a study to assess the prevalence and impact of domestic 
violence, the outcome of which would be used to inform the enactment of legislation on 
domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>30. The delegation stated that it was necessary to proceed cautiously, beginning with 
sensitizing the public in order to pave the way for the establishment of a Human Rights 
Commission, and that the relevant draft legislation was already in place.    
</p>
<p>31. Lesotho was overdue in submitting some reports under certain human rights 
instruments owing to, inter alia, limited capacity. However, measures were being taken to 
address the situation.  
</p>
<p>32. Regarding an invitation to special procedure mandate holders, the delegation noted 
that Lesotho had already resorted to that function under APRM and found it to be quite 
adequate, and that duplication of efforts should be avoided.  
</p>
<p>33. The delegation indicated that the 2007 general election had never been subject to 
dispute. What had been disputed was the allocation of proportional representation seats. 
These were allocated by an independent body, IEC. Parties had agreed to amend relevant 
electoral laws in preparation for the 2012 general elections, while dialogue continued on the 
allocation of proportional representation seats and other outstanding issues. 
</p>
<p>34. The delegation concluded by indicating Lesotho&#8217;s ambition to move forward 
expeditiously towards best practice in the field of human rights. The pace was determined 
by the availability of the requisite resources and capacity, as well as the receptiveness of 
society.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>35. During the interactive dialogue, 48 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>36. A number of delegations thanked Lesotho for its cooperation with the universal 
periodic review mechanism and commended the delegation for the consultative process for 
the preparation of the national report, as well as for the comprehensive presentation.  
</p>
<p>37. Nicaragua recognized Lesotho&#8217;s implementation of its strategic framework, Vision 
</p><p>2020. It noted that poverty and extreme poverty were the principal obstacles to the full 
enjoyment of human rights. It applauded Lesotho&#8217;s strategies of alternative development, 
adapted to its situation, with a view to achieving a stable democracy, peace and security, 
good governance and the full enjoyment of human rights. It noted the negative impact of 
the current economic and financial crisis on Lesotho&#8217;s economy. It asked about measures to 
harmonize its mixed judicial system with international human rights norms. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Mexico noted Lesotho&#8217;s challenges, particularly under difficult economic and social 
conditions. It welcomed the implementation of Vision 2020, which identified areas of 
priority attention and programmes of structural adjustment for poverty reduction. It noted 
Lesotho&#8217;s adherence to and ratification of a number of international human rights 
instruments. It asked about the submission of overdue reports to treaty bodies and the 
incorporation of international obligations into national laws and norms. It expressed 
solidarity with Lesotho&#8217;s appeal for material, technical and financial assistance. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>39. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela highlighted Lesotho&#8217;s efforts in education, in 
spite of the global economic and financial crisis affecting its economy. It noted the fact that 
free primary education had been introduced in 2000, the implementation of the programme 
&#8220;Education for All&#8221; and Lesotho&#8217;s unique position in sub-Saharan Africa, with an 
enrolment rate of 84 per cent for 2006. It highlighted the efforts to establish mandatory 
primary education and to promote amendments to the Law of Education. It made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>40. Cuba highlighted the strategies of Lesotho concerning the fight against poverty; the 
modification of the law of racial relations, which provided for protection from racial hate; 
and the 2008 law on the environment. It also highlighted advances in protecting the rights 
of peoples with disabilities, women and children, ensuring access to health and education 
and guaranteeing the right to food. It highlighted the National Plan of Food Security and 
strategies to improve agricultural productivity. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Brazil noted the increase in the representation of women in political positions. The 
persistence of female genital mutilation was of particular concern, and it expressed concern 
about allegations of excessive control of the media. It asked in which areas the international 
community could better assist in controlling and combating the spread of HIV/AIDS. It 
asked what measures were being undertaken to guarantee that social, economic and cultural 
rights received the same treatment as civil and political rights under the Constitution. Brazil 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. Belarus noted that Lesotho needed international assistance to resolve the problems it 
faced with respect to the AIDS/HIV pandemic and poverty, and to ensure capacity-building 
for human rights protection. It congratulated Lesotho on its support for UNICEF and the 
European Commission in its effort to help categories of children, including orphans. It 
welcomed the drafting of a bill on the protection and well-being of children, considered as a 
priority by the Government. Belarus made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>43. Algeria referred to the technical assistance requested by Lesotho with respect to its 
periodic reports and the setting up of a national human rights commission. It also inquired 
about the measures Lesotho intended to take to overcome the negative effects of the 
economic and financial crisis and to indicate what kind of assistance was needed in that 
area. Algeria noted that improving the functioning of justice was one of the national 
priorities. It inquired about the measures Lesotho intended to take to find a lasting solution 
to the problem of food insecurity. Algeria made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. The United States of America commended Lesotho for efforts to eliminate gender 
discrimination and advance women&#8217;s role in the political realm. It noted the statement 
promising figures regarding women&#8217;s participation in local government. It urged taking 
advantage of the international focus to rally support for a comprehensive law to combat the 
trafficking in persons. It commended efforts to professionalize the police and to guard 
against impunity. It commended the tabling of the children&#8217;s protection and welfare bill and 
hoped that the bill would be promptly enacted, taking into account the statement that it 
drew inspiration from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The United States made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. Argentina recognized the establishment of the Ministry of Gender Affairs and the 
Unit for the Protection of Women and Children, and the focus on positive discrimination 
adopted at the level of local government. It asked about legislation on the age of majority, 
as well as women&#8217;s civil rights. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>46. Egypt commended the efforts made in the fight against poverty, including the 
poverty reduction strategy paper and National Vision 2020, based on the three principles of 
democracy, good governance and human rights. It hailed efforts undertaken to provide 
quality health services, in addition to compulsory free primary education, and for the </p>


<p>achievement of food security. It welcomed in particular the adoption of the Children&#8217;s 
Protection Act of 1980. However, it stated that such efforts were hampered by the lack of 
capacity and resources. Egypt made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. Germany appreciated the fact that the interests of the child remained one of the top 
priorities in the Government&#8217;s policies and programmes. On the other hand, the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child had raised serious concerns about incidents of violence against 
children committed by law enforcement officials and the lack of investigation or criminal 
justice response to such incidents. Another serious issue was the indications of a high 
number of sexual abuses against women. It asked which measures the Government had 
taken or would take to strengthen the awareness of children&#8217;s rights issues within the 
criminal justice system. Germany made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>48. Norway noted the progress reported on gender equality, but remained concerned 
about, inter alia, the persistence of discrimination based on customary law. It expressed 
concern about apparently insufficient information about, and the organization of, the local 
elections to be held in 2010. It was concerned about the Independent Electoral Commission 
and its ability and role in electoral processes and in disseminating voter awareness. It 
expressed concern about reports that newspapers had been subjected to claims of 
defamation for having reported on political leaders. It commended the draft media policy, 
which included appropriate codification of the right to freedom of expression. Norway 
made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>49. Morocco inquired about the community programme for rehabilitating persons with 
disabilities, launched in 2005, and particularly its goals and its implementation process. 
Morocco noted with satisfaction the National Vision 2020 as a strategic framework for 
economic, social, political and human development. It referred to the negative impact of the 
international financial and economic crisis on Lesotho. Finally, Morocco was pleased by 
the priority placed on the establishment of a human rights commission in accordance with 
the Paris Principles. Morocco made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>50. Nigeria encouraged Lesotho to continue to build its socio-economic and political 
frameworks for enhancing the protection and promotion of fundamental human rights and 
freedoms for its people. It referred to the challenges faced by Lesotho in the 
implementation of its international and national human rights obligations. Therefore, it 
called on the international community and United Nations agencies such as WHO and FAO 
to provide support to Lesotho. Nigeria made one recommendation.  
</p>
<p>51. Bangladesh highlighted Lesotho&#8217;s challenges as a least developed country. It 
appreciated the efforts made in education and in enhancing the participation of children at 
the primary level through legislation and the Vision 2020 initiative, which addressed the 
rights of children. It expressed concern about violence against women and HIV/AIDS 
prevalence. It reiterated that the international community should consider providing support 
to Lesotho for follow-up on recommendations. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Netherlands commended Lesotho for having ratified most core human rights treaties. 
It expressed concern that, despite the country&#8217;s efforts, violence against women and 
children persisted. It expressed concern about the reported interference of the army in the 
discharge of the duties of the police, in matters such as the disputes following the 2007 
elections. It noted with concern the reported lack of independence of the judiciary. It 
mentioned the issue of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, and the 
fact that a sexual relationship between consenting adult men was still illegal. It understood 
that the Sexual Offences Act had made the Sodomy Law useless. Netherlands made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>53. Indonesia noted with appreciation the fact that Lesotho had ratified almost all the 
core human rights treaties. It welcomed Lesotho&#8217;s efforts to promote the rights of people </p>


<p>with disabilities by establishing the Rehabilitation Unit in the Ministry of Health. It also 
referred to the fact that HIV/AIDS was considered the single most important threat to the 
development of the country. Indonesia made recommendations<b>. </b> 
</p>
<p>54. China highlighted Lesotho&#8217;s progress in increasing the literacy rate, improving the 
political status of women and curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS. China welcomed Vision 
2020, a strategic framework for reducing poverty and improving the protection of the rights 
of adolescents and children with disabilities. It noted poverty, HIV/AIDS and the shortage 
of food as challenges. It appealed to the international community to provide the technical 
assistance necessary to help the country overcome these difficulties and achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Ireland<b> </b>welcomed, inter alia, the passage of the Legal Capacity of Married Persons 
Act 2006 and the provision of free primary education and legislation making it compulsory. 
With regard to the Public Processions and Meetings Bill before Parliament, it noted that 
civil society groups and political parties would have to apply for permission. It considered 
that safeguards should ensure that the provisions of the Bill did not infringe on the right to 
freedom of association and assembly. It was aware that the death penalty was still on the 
State books, and it wished to encourage the formalization of the moratorium and the 
abolition of the death penalty. Ireland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>56. France referred to independent reports and to the Human Rights Committee, noting 
frequent instances of torture and ill treatment by the police, in particular with respect to 
inmates held in prisons. France referred to treaty bodies and special procedures, citing the 
persistence of serious discrimination against women with regard to employment, education, 
inheritance and the right to property. It referred to the 2007 UNFPA report, which indicated 
an increase of violence against women and a high incidence of HIV/ AIDS among women. 
It inquired about the measures that the Government intended to take to remedy that 
situation. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Philippine noted Lesotho&#8217;s challenges as well as its ratification of virtually all core 
human rights instruments. It highlighted that the international community should help 
Lesotho in submitting reports to treaty bodies, and also in establishing a national human 
rights institution, for which draft legislation was in place. It noted that a children&#8217;s 
protection and welfare bill, patterned after CRC, was being considered by Parliament. It 
welcomed the fact that there had been no execution of capital punishment sentences since 
1995, and it also welcomed the promotion of gender equality and women&#8217;s rights. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Australia looked forward to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission. 
Although executions had not been carried out since 1995, it regretted the fact that Lesotho 
had not formally abolished the death penalty. While noting progress in women&#8217;s rights, 
Australia expressed concern about ongoing gender discrimination, violence against women 
and unequal access to employment. It noted with concern reports of violence against and 
the sexual exploitation of children, as well as child labour. It remained troubled by ongoing 
discrimination against homosexuals and the criminalization of male homosexuality. 
Australia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. Canada stressed that the 2003 Sexual Offence Act and the 2006 Legal Capacity of 
Married Persons Act represented significant milestones in the advancement of women&#8217;s 
rights. It expressed concern about reports regarding the incidence of child exploitation, 
abuse, trafficking and child labour, and the fact that some of these violations were 
increasing. Canada noted the State&#8217;s direct ownership and control of public broadcasting 
and its content. Canada made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted attempts to 
address differences over the 2007 election results, a review of the Electoral Law, and hoped </p>


<p>that all parties were confident that their views would be represented in the 2012 elections. 
The United Kingdom urged legislation to abolish the death penalty. It welcomed and asked 
about the further improvement of prison conditions. It noted concerns and urged the 
establishment of a media council to ensure media plurality. It encouraged the prioritization 
of domestic violence legislation and asked about other measures to be taken to address 
gender-based violence. The United Kingdom made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>61. Senegal was pleased that Lesotho was a party to most international legal human 
rights instruments and had adopted a number of laws to protect those rights, including for 
women, children and persons with disabilities.  Senegal also noted that Lesotho had 
established a number of institutions tasked with protecting and promoting human rights, 
stressing human rights education, and it welcomed this spirit. Senegal made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. In response, the delegation of Lesotho thanked the States for their questions. The 
head of delegation stated that, to the best of her knowledge, Lesotho did not practice female 
genital mutilation. Concerning food insecurity, the Government was doing its best to invest 
resources in an agricultural project, &#8220;block farming&#8221;, assisting farmers in increasing food 
production. With support from donor partners, Lesotho would be able to deal with the issue 
of food insecurity to some degree. 
</p>
<p>63. With regard to addressing the issue of social, economic and cultural rights on an 
equal footing with that of civil and political rights, the delegation indicated that this would 
depend on, inter alia, economic strength, and that it was making progress. In considering 
education and health policies, Lesotho was making an effort to ensure that those rights were 
enjoyed.  
</p>
<p>64. With regard to reporting under human rights instruments, Lesotho was indeed 
engaged in consultations with OHCHR for technical assistance to ensure that the country 
complied with reporting obligations. The delegation considered that Lesotho would be able 
to accomplish this shortly.  
</p>
<p>65. Concerning the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, the delegation 
referred to the technical assistance of UNDP, through which Lesotho had prepared a draft 
piece of legislation. Challenges included establishing appropriate infrastructure and 
assigning commissioners, given Lesotho&#8217;s limited resources. Lesotho was raising public 
awareness, which would pave the way for the draft bill to be tabled before Parliament.  
</p>
<p>66. With respect to the human rights situation during the political unrest, such as that in 
2007, as had been pointed out, the delegation stated that the Government insisted on the 
rule of law. Aggrieved citizens had the right to resort to legal means, the courts, the 
ombudsman and the police complaints mechanism, and the delegation emphasized that all 
reported cases, even those against law enforcement officials, would be investigated and, 
where necessary, brought before courts of law.  
</p>
<p>67. The delegation stated that the Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Bill had been read 
out before Parliament on 5 May 2010 and that there was confidence that, given the 
preparations, it would shortly be adopted. Financial resources were a major challenge to the 
implementation of the Bill, as it provided for the introduction of institutions to be built. 
Child labour and other social and welfare issues were included in the Bill. 
</p>
<p>68. Concerning HIV/AIDS, the delegation indicated that Lesotho had a policy and was 
drafting a bill that would be taken to Parliament in order to address issues concerning 
infected persons, including children and all groups affected by the pandemic.  
</p>
<p>69. As regards the death penalty, the delegation of Lesotho stated that it continued to 
exist as it was confined to three capital crimes and that, beyond that point, the courts always 
adopted a very restrictive approach. Even when the death penalty was imposed, the Pardons </p>


<p>Committee would recommend that the head of State exercise his prerogative of mercy in 
commuting it to life imprisonment. The delegation stated that, in reality, capital punishment 
did not exist in Lesotho, although it remained in the statute book. 
</p>
<p>70. The delegation stated that as regards local government elections, which were 
supposed to be held in 2010, there was an agreement with all stakeholders to delay this 
election in order to clarify and straighten out certain issues as regards the local councils. On 
the issue of freedom of expression, it is enshrined in the constitution. While exercising it 
towards other people, the prescribed limitations on such cases will be decided by the courts.

resources at its disposal to protect and enhance the independence of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>72. As regards children and justice, Lesotho remained ready to support the rights of 
children, as it regarded them as the future. Lesotho was working tirelessly to reform the 
justice sector and to be more sensitive in its treatment of children who had come into 
contact with the law. It had developed units within the police service to care for such 
children and conducted related training programmes for judges, prosecutors and 
magistrates. Lesotho, with the assistance of the United Nations, was carrying out sustained 
sensitization programmes to provide care for children in contact with the justice system, in 
compliance with the relevant United Nations guidelines.

the effective realization of human rights in general and the human rights set out in CRC and 
CEDAW in particular. Hungary urged Lesotho to fully implement the principle of non-
discrimination regarding girls and women by improving, inter alia, their access to education 
and health. Referring to overdue national treaty body reports, it stressed that, while 
technical assistance might be necessary, it should not be a substitute for States&#8217; primary 
responsibility in terms of protecting and promoting human rights. Hungary made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>76. Slovakia<b> </b>highlighted a report indicating rising levels of gender-based violence. It

Protection Unit and the Victims of Crime Support Office. It stated that the minimum age of 
criminal responsibility, currently 7 years, was very low. It referred to a 2007 report 
indicating a high incidence of the sexual abuse of children. Slovakia made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>77. Italy expressed concern at the persistence of customary practices in contrast with the 
rights of women and the widespread phenomenon of violence against women and girls, 
including domestic and sexual violence. It welcomed the de facto moratorium on the death </p>

provisions of CRC, including the minimum age for criminal responsibility. It made 
recommendations.

in the world. It welcomed the draft bill on children&#8217;s protection and welfare, currently being

legal instruments, including ICCPR, ICESCR, CERD and CRC. It noted the policy to 
promote the rights of the people with disabilities, enacted five years previous, and

and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS. The practice of commuting the death penalty to life 
sentences was one to be continued. 
</p>
<p>82. Nepal<b> </b>noted that the Office of the Ombudsman was empowered to investigate any 
malpractice in administrative offices, while the Police Complaints Authority investigated

Human Rights Unit had been established within the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and 
Correctional Service, and it welcomed the plan to establish a national human rights 
commission. It commended efforts to promote gender parity and noted the success achieved

effects of the economic and financial crisis, which threatened, inter alia, to undermine its 
social safety net mechanisms. It made recommendations.  
</p>

that had been made in extremely difficult circumstances to promote human rights despite 
the global economic crisis. Indeed, the socio-economic situation in Lesotho had been faced
