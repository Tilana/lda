HEALTHBRIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
(A Development Stage Company)
NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2005
(Unaudited)
Note 1 — Organization
The interim consolidated financial statements consist of Healthbridge, Inc. (Healthbridge) and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Healthbridge AG (Healthbridge AG) (collectively “the Company”).
Healthbridge was organized on February 17, 1993 (date of inception) under the laws of the State
of Texas. Healthbridge AG was formed as a German subsidiary during 2002.
On January 25, 2002, the Company acquired certain patents related to the infectious medical
waste sterilization and disposal technologies developed in Germany. Since this time the
Company’s operations have consisted primarily of (1) developing a marketing philosophy and
marketing strategy, (2) pursuing and assembling a management team, and (3) obtaining sufficient
working capital through loans from shareholders and debt and equity financing. Further, the
Company is considered a development stage company as defined in SFAS No. 7.
Note 2 — Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by
management in accordance with the instructions in Form 10-QSB and, therefore, do not include
all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles and should,
therefore, be read in conjunction with the Company’s Form 10-KSB/A for the year ended
December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements do
include all normal recurring adjustments which the Company believes necessary for a fair
presentation of the statements. The interim operations results are not necessarily indicative of the
results for the full year ending December 31, 2005.
Note 3 — Additional Footnotes Included By Reference
Except as indicated in Notes above, there have been no other material changes in the
information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements included in the Company’s Form
10-KSB/A for the year ended December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Therefore, those footnotes are included herein by reference.
Note 4 — Going Concern
As of September 30, 2005, the Company’s revenue generating activities had not generated
sufficient funds for profitable operations, and the Company has incurred losses since inception.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.
Management intends to seek additional equity funding to expand marketing efforts and product
development. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the Company or
that marketing and product development efforts will be successful.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2005
(Unaudited)
Note 7 – Write off of intangible assets
On June 30, 2005 the Company reviewed the carrying value of its patents and determined that
the prospect of sales this year and future expected cashflow from sales of the Valides system
were unknown. Therefore the Company determined that there was sufficient evidence to indicate
that the realization of the carrying value of the patent asset was impaired. Pursuant to the
Company’s determination, it wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of $262,890 of its
capitalized cost in the patents related to the Valides® Modular Infectious Waste Disposal
System.
Note 8 – Subsequent Events
On October 3, 2005 the Company reached an agreement with outstanding debenture holders to
pay outstanding interest due in shares of the Company’s common stock. Accordingly, the
Company issued 136,298 shares of common stock to Global Convertible Megatrend Ltd. for
$13,628 owed, and 56,250 shares of common stock to Max Fugman for $5,625 owed as of
September 30, 2005.
On October 25, 2005 the Company reached an agreement with Markus Mueller to satisfy certain
outstanding debt with shares of the Company’s common stock. Under the agreement the
Company issued 2,092,293 shares of common stock in satisfaction of $101,500 in debt due to
Mr. Mueller for consulting fees, $6,000 of a cash loan, and $527 in interest due from the
Company and €73,826 (US$88,945) due as the result of a loan to Healthbridge AG in addition to
€10,174 (US$12,257) in interest.
On October 25, 2005 the Company issued 50,000 of common stock shares in the name of Nora
Coccaro for additional consulting fees valued at $5,000.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes and the other
financial information appearing elsewhere in this periodic report. The Company’s fiscal year end
is December 31.
This report and the exhibits attached hereto contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements
include, without limitation, statements as to management’s good faith expectations and beliefs,
which are subject to inherent uncertainties which are difficult to predict and may be beyond the
ability of the Company to control. Forward-looking statements are made based upon
management’s expectations and belief concerning future developments and their potential effect
upon the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance
with management’s expectations or that the effect of future developments on the Company will be
those anticipated by management.
The words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “hopes,” “likely,” “will,” and
similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the
actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to differ
materially from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include (i) the sufficiency of
existing capital resources and the Company’s ability to raise additional capital to fund cash
requirements for future operations; (ii) uncertainties involved in the rate of growth of the
Company’s business and acceptance of products and services; (iii) the ability of the Company to
achieve and maintain a sufficient customer base to have sufficient revenues to fund and maintain
operations; (iv) volatility of the stock market; and (v) general economic conditions. Although the
Company believes the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are
reasonable, such expectations may prove to be incorrect.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which
reflect management’s view only as of the date of this report. The Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements
which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events, conditions or circumstances. For additional information
about risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company’s forward-looking
statements, please refer to the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including its Annual Report on Form 10-KSB/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.
General
In early 2002 the Company acquired exclusive ownership of the Valides® Modular Infectious
Waste Disposal System and the Medides System. The acquisition included all the intellectual
property associated with the technologies including patents, patents pending, proprietary
software and licenses required to manufacture, operate and market these technologies
worldwide.
10
The Valides® and the Medides Systems were developed for the treatment of infectious medical
wastes generated by hospitals, laboratories, dental offices, clinics, blood banks and other
facilities in the medical industry due to the prohibitive escalation of costs associated with the
disposal of infectious waste. Countries around the world have imposed increasingly stringent
health and safety regulations regarding the transport of infectious medical waste to disposal sites
and in some instances have even prohibited the transportation of certain infectious wastes.
Growing concern over the potential affects of infectious waste disposal on our environment and
the imposition of increasingly rigid air quality standards, combined with a myriad of other
restrictive guidelines for incinerator or land fill disposal, have made it a growing problem in need
of an effective solution.
Business Operations
The Company’s short term strategy is to realize net cash flow from operations and to use net
cash flow to expand marketing efforts in the Middle East with particular emphasis on Kuwait. The
realization of net cash flow in the near term will require a significant increase in the Company’s
revenues. Once the Company has achieved net cash flow, its longer term strategy is to expand
marketing efforts worldwide.
However, the Company has historically not been able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to sustain its business and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to generate sufficient future cash flows to sustain future operations. Since the Company is
currently unable to generate sufficient cash flow from the sale of its products it will seek debt or
equity financing. The Company can provide no assurance that such financing efforts will be
successful.
The Company’s business development strategy is prone to significant risks and uncertainties
certain of which can have an immediate impact on its efforts to realize positive net cash flow and
deter the prospect of revenue growth. The Company’s financial condition and results of
operations have depended historically on debt and equity financing from related parties. Sales of
the Valides® System since acquisition have been limited to one unit sold in the second quarter of
2004. Therefore, in the near term, the Company’s ability to develop its business will continue to
rely upon the Company’s facility to raise working capital, the ability to reduce administrative
expenses and the realization of future revenues. The Company’s limited history of generating
revenue should not be viewed as an indication of future revenue.
For the fiscal period ended September 30, 2005 the Company realized a net loss from
operations. The net loss was due to a lack of revenues in the quarter and general and
administrative expenses. Further, equity funding realized during the period was insufficient to
expand the Company’s limited operations.
The Company believes that any expectation of achieving profitably in the near term will require a
significant increase in debt or equity funding. Sufficient capital will enable management to
negotiate lower manufacturing costs for new units, either by reaching an agreement with a third
party manufacturer or establishing its own manufacturing facility and to implement a
comprehensive marketing strategy. However, the Company can offer no assurance that any
significant increase in debt or equity funding will be available to the Company over the next
twelve months. Should the Company fail to expand its operations over the next twelve months,
any combination of limited revenue and ordinary expenses may compromise the Company’s
ability to continue its current business operations.
11
Results of Operations
During the period from January 1, 2005 through September 30, 2005, the Company was involved
in the development, manufacture, and marketing of the Valides® and Medides Systems medical
waste sterilization and disposal technologies to the international market place for medical waste
disposal.
Revenue
Revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2005 was $0 from $0 for the three
month period ended September 30, 2004. Revenue for the nine month period ended September
30, 2005 decreased to $0 from $73,304 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004.
Revenue in the nine month period ended September 30, 2004 can be attributed to the sale of a
single Valides® unit. Since that sale the Company has been without revenues. The Company’s
financial condition has caused it to curtail marketing efforts and it can provide no assurance of
any future revenue from the sale of its products.
Losses
Net losses for the three month period ended September 30, 2005 increased to $113,310 from
$89,715 for the three month period ended September 30, 2004, an increase of 26%. Net losses
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 increased to $505,431 from $231,531 for
the for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, an increase of 118%. The increase in
net losses over the comparative three month periods can be attributed to an increase in general
and administrative expenses. The increase in net losses over the comparative nine month
periods can be attributed to an increase in general and administrative expenses and the
impairment of capitalized patent costs. The Company expects to reduce net losses over the next
twelve months.
Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2005
increased to $104,232 from $78,195 for the three month period ended September 30, 2004, an
increase of 33%. General and administrative expenses for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2005 increased to $221,255 from $197,628 for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2004, an increase of 12%. The increase in general and administrative expenses
over the comparative three and nine month periods can be attributed to an increase in legal,
consulting and accounting costs. The Company expects that general and administrative
expenses will remain relatively consistent over future periods.
Cost of goods sold for the three month period ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $0. Cost
of goods sold for the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 decreased to $0 from
$71,475 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2004. Cost of goods sold in the prior
nine month period can be attributed to the manufacture of a single Valides® unit. The Company
expects that its cost of goods sold will increase or decrease in correlation to the production of
additional units of the Valides® system.
Depreciation expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and September 30, 2004
were $20,629 and $9,687 respectively.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
The Company has an income tax benefit resulting from net operating losses to offset any future
operating profit. However, the Company has not recorded this benefit in the financial statements
as it may not meet the accounting criteria to do so.
Impact of Inflation
12
The Company believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past three
years. The Company believes that it can offset inflationary increases in the cost of materials and
labor by increasing sales and improving operating efficiencies.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash flow used in operations was $104,145 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, as
compared to cash flow provided by operations of $38,624 for the nine months ended September
30, 2004. Cash flow used in operations for the current nine month period is primarily attributable
to an increase in net loss and the decrease in related party payables. The Company expects that
cash flows continue to be used in operations until such time as revenues are realized and losses
decrease.
Cash flows used in investing activities were $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005
as compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $0 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2004. The Company expects that cash flows used in investing activities may
increase in future periods.
Cash flow produced from financing activities was $125,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005, as compared to $0 cash flow produced from financing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2004. The cash flows produced from financing activities for the
nine month period were the result of subscription based stock issuances. The Company expects
that cash flows produced from financing activities may increase in future periods as required to
effect its business operations.
The Company adopted The 2004 Benefit Plan of Healthbridge, Inc. on May 24, 2004. Under the
benefit plan, the Company may issue stock, or grant options to acquire the Company’s common
stock, to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries. The board of directors, at its own
discretion may also issue stock or grant options to other individuals, including consultants or
advisors, who render services to the Company or its subsidiaries, provided that the services
rendered are not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction.
Further, no stock may be issued, or option granted under the benefit plan to consultants,
advisors, or other persons who directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the
Company’s stock. The Company has issued 100,000 shares pursuant to the benefit plan as of
the period ended September 30, 2005 and has to date granted no options. The benefit plan is
registered on Form S-8 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment, outside of
normal items to be utilized by office personnel. The establishment of a manufacturing facility will
be postponed until such time as capital becomes available. Until such time, the Company will
rely on a third party manufacturer for the production of additional units of the Valides® System as
orders may require.
The Company has no current plans to make any significant changes in the number of employees.
Any decision to hire manufacturing or sales personnel will be postponed until such time as
capital becomes available.
The Company had a working capital deficit of $251,637 as of September 30, 2005 and has
funded its cash needs from inception through revenues and a series of debt and equity
transactions, including several private placements. The bulk of these transactions have taken
place outside the United States. Since the Company has realized limited revenues it will still
require new debt or equity transactions to satisfy cash needs over the next twelve months.
Critical Accounting Policies
13
In the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2004 included in the Company’ Form 10-KSB/A, the Company discusses those accounting
policies that are considered to be significant in determining the results of operations and its
financial position. The Company believes that the accounting principles utilized by it conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. By their
nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an on-going basis,
the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible
assets, warranty obligations, product liability, revenue, and income taxes. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and other facts and circumstances that are believed to be
reasonable, and the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of
assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.
The Company applies the following critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition in
the preparation of its financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has generated revenue through the sale of Valides® Modular Infectious Waste
Disposal System and the Medides Systems. Revenue is recognized only when persuasive
evidence for a sales arrangement exists; delivery of the product has occurred; the product fee is
fixed or determinable; and collection of the fee is reasonably assured. Any revenue derived from
the sale would be initially recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. The amount of
deferred income would be recognized as income over the term of the contract.
ITEM 3. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company’s president acts as the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer and is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for
the Company.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of Company’s management, including the chief
executive officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), as of September 30, 2005. Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective and adequately designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms and that such
information was accumulated and communicated to our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, in a manner that allowed for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The auditors did not test the effectiveness of nor relied on the internal controls of the Company for
the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2005 and 2004.
(b) Changes in Internal Controls
14
During the period ended September 30, 2005, there was no change in internal control over
financial reporting that materially affected, or was reasonably likely to materially affect the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
However, the Company’s chief executive officer has concluded that changes will be made to
internal controls over financial reporting which may materially affect our financial reporting
obligations. Our chief executive officer will make certain proposals to the Company’s board of
directors to implement changes to safeguard against future errors in financial disclosure. The
proposals include a segregation of the duties of principal executive officer and chief financial
officer, the appointment of an independent director to the Company’s board of directors and the
formation of an audit committee. Our chief executive officer believes that the segregation of a
chief executive officer’s duties from that of a chief financial officer and the formation of an audit
committee would cause the Company to better evaluate the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures on a constant basis with the
intention of discovering any potential misstatements prior to erroneous disclosure.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
None.
ITEM 2. CHANGES IN SECURITIES
On October 25, 2005 the board of directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 50,000
shares of common stock to the Company’s officer and director, Nora Coccaro, for consulting fees
totaling $0.10 a share or $5,000. The Company relied on exemptions provided by Section 4(2)
and Regulation S of the Securities Act.
The Company made this offering based on the following factors: (1) the issuance was an isolated
private transaction by the Company which did not involve a public offering; (2) there was only
one offeree who was issued the Company’s stock for services to the Company; (3) the offeree
stated an intention not to resell the stock; (4) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous
public offerings of the stock; (5) the stock was not broken down into smaller denominations; and
(6) the negotiations that lead to the issuance of the stock took place directly between the offeree
and the Company.
Regulation S provides generally that any offer or sale that occurs outside of the United States is
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, provided that certain conditions
are met. Regulation S has two safe harbors. One safe harbor applies to offers and sales by
issuers, securities professionals involved in the distribution process pursuant to contract, their
respective affiliates, and persons acting on behalf of any of the foregoing (the “issuer safe
harbor”), and the other applies to resales by persons other than the issuer, securities
professionals involved in the distribution process pursuant to contract, their respective affiliates
(except certain officers and directors), and persons acting on behalf of any of the forgoing (the
“resale safe harbor”). An offer, sale or resale of securities that satisfied all conditions of the
applicable safe harbor is deemed to be outside the United States as required by Regulation S.
The distribution compliance period for shares sold in reliance on Regulation S is one year.
15
The Company complied with the requirements of Regulation S by having no directed selling
efforts made in the United States, by selling only to an offeree who was outside the United States
at the time the settlement of accrued interest was agreed, and ensuring that the person to whom
the stock was issued was a non-U.S. person with an address in a foreign country and having
each person make representation to the Company certifying that he or she is not a U.S. person
and is not acquiring the securities for the account or benefit of a U.S. person other than persons
who acquired the securities in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act; and also agrees only to sell the securities in accordance with the registration
provisions of the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, or in accordance with the provisions
of Regulation S.
On October 25, 2005 the board of directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 2,092,293
shares of common stock to Markus Mueller, pursuant to an agreement for the cancellation of debt
from consulting fees, loans made to the Company and interest totaling $0.10 a share or
$209,229. The Company relied on exemptions provided by Section 4(2) and Regulation S of the
Securities Act.

shares of common stock to Global Convertible Megatrend Ltd., in satisfaction of interest due on a
certain debenture valued at $0.10 a share or $13,628. The Company relied on exemptions
