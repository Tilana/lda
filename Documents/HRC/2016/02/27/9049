</p>
<p><b>I.  EDUCATION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Education is an inalienable human right, and is more than a mere commodity or a service. 
Furthermore, education is a human right that is crucial to the realization of a wide array of other 
human rights, and an indispensable agency for the expansion of human capabilities and the 
enhancement of human dignity. Education plays a formative role in socialization for democratic 
citizenship and represents an essential support for community identity. It is also a primary means 
by which individuals and communities can sustainably lift themselves out of poverty and a 
means of helping minorities to overcome the legacies of historical injustice or discrimination 
committed against them. 
</p>
<p>2. The right to education is not in practice enjoyed equally by all. Minorities<b>1</b> in various 
regions of the world suffer disproportionately from unequal or restricted access to quality 
education and inappropriate education strategies. Lack of education leads to denial of civil and 
political rights, including rights to freedom of movement and freedom of expression, and limits 
participation in the cultural, social and economic life of the State and in public affairs, such as in 
the exercise of voting rights. Lack of education also limits the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights, including rights to employment, health, housing and an adequate standard of 
living. Lack of education results in reticence to engage with law enforcement authorities, 
inhibiting access to remedies when human rights are violated. 
</p>
<p>3. Women and girl members of minority communities suffer disproportionately from lack of 
access to education and from high illiteracy levels. Lack of education represents an absolute 
barrier to their progress and empowerment. 
</p>
<p>4. Bad education strategies can violate human rights as much as good strategies enhance 
rights and freedoms. Unwanted assimilation imposed through the medium of education, or 
enforced social segregation generated through educational processes, are harmful to the rights 
and interests of minority communities and to the wider social interest. 
</p>
<p>5. In the context of rights and obligations recognized at the level of the United Nations and 
regionally, education should serve the dual function of supporting the efforts of communities to 
self-development in economic, social and cultural terms while opening pathways by which they 
can function in the wider society and promote social harmony. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The term &#8220;minorities&#8221; as used in the present recommendation should be understood as it is 
</p>
<p>used in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities (General Assembly resolution 47/135), the commentary of the Working 
Group on Minorities to the Declaration (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/2) and the first annual report 
of the independent expert on minority issues (E/CN.4/2006/74). It encompasses the persons and 
groups protected under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination from discrimination based on race, colour, descent (caste), national or ethnic 
origin, citizen or non-citizen (General Assembly resolution 2106 (XX)). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>6. The present recommendations, while framed as recommendations for Government action, 
are intended for a wider readership of not only Governments but, in the terms of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, &#8220;every individual and every organ of society&#8221;, including 
international organizations and agencies, civil society in the widest sense, all educators and those 
who learn from them. 
</p>
<p>7. The range of issues included in the recommendations is not exhaustive. They represent 
only minimum requirements for an effective education strategy for minorities, without prejudice 
to further efforts made by individual States to address the needs of individuals and groups 
concerned. The recommendations should be interpreted in a generous spirit in cooperation with 
the communities concerned, in the light of the demand that human rights instruments be 
interpreted and standards applied to be effective in practice, so that they can make a real 
difference to the lives of human beings. In the event of doubt or contestation with regard to their 
potential application, the principles should be interpreted in favour of members of minorities as 
bearers of rights but also as potential victims of educational deprivation. 
</p>
<p>8. The recommendations are phrased in broad terms and can be implemented in countries 
with diverse historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, with full respect for universal human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CORE PRINCIPLES 
</b></p>
<p>9. Every person is entitled to accessible, free and high-quality primary level education. States 
should take reasonable legislative and other measures to achieve the progressive realization of 
this right with respect to secondary education and for higher education on the basis of capacity. 
The right to education for all is grounded in universal and regional human rights instruments, 
including instruments on minority rights. The core principles of international human rights are 
fully applicable to the right to education and should be faithfully implemented by States. These 
include the principles of equality and non-discrimination, as well as the principle of equality of 
women and men in the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The principle 
of non-discrimination includes all persons of school age residing in the territory of a State, 
including non-nationals, and irrespective of their legal status. 
</p>
<p>10. School policies or practices that, de jure or de facto, segregate students into different 
groups based on minority status violate the rights of minorities and also rob the entire society of 
its best opportunity to foster social cohesion and respect for a diversity of views and experiences. 
Students and societies gain the greatest educational advantage when classrooms have a diversity 
of students, ethnically, culturally and economically. 
</p>
<p>11. The principle of equality does not imply uniform treatment in the field of education 
regardless of circumstances, but rather that differential treatment of individuals and groups is 
justified when specified circumstances warrant it, so that the right to equal treatment is also 
violated when States, without permissible justification, fail to treat differently persons whose 
situations are significantly different. The principle of non-discrimination implies that persons 
belonging to minorities should not be treated differently in the field of education solely on the 
basis of their particular ethnic, religious or cultural characteristics, unless there are permissible </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>criteria to justify such distinctions, including criteria set out in specific instruments on minority 
rights. National and local contexts are important in the detailed application of educational 
responsibilities and Governments enjoy a margin of appreciation in applying the principles to 
particular contexts. 
</p>
<p>12. Principles of equality and non-discrimination permit the taking of special temporary 
measures. Such measures are mandatory when the conditions for their application are satisfied. 
Special measures or affirmative action should be used, for instance, as a means for Governments 
to recognize the existence of structural discrimination and to combat it. The case of special 
measures or affirmative action should not be confused with minority or indigenous rights to 
existence and identity that subsist as long as the individuals and communities concerned desire 
the continued application of these rights. Measures taken in the field of education for minorities 
should not constitute a programme of coerced or artificial assimilation. 
</p>
<p>13. Education for all students should have an intercultural approach that recognizes and values 
cultural diversity. There must be a development of intercultural and anti-racist capacity within 
educational institutions at every level and informing all policies. 
</p>
<p>14. Minorities have a right to participate in the life of the State and in decisions affecting them 
and their children&#8217;s future. In the field of education, this right implies input by minorities into the 
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of education programmes and the 
administration of educational institutions. It also means that an alternative to mainstream 
curricula may be considered in order to meet the needs, aspirations and priorities of minorities. 
</p>
<p>15. The responsibilities of the State to fulfil the rights to education and to non-discrimination 
are not diluted on account of the complexities of political structures: the responsibilities extend 
in principle to the whole of the State territory. Governments must make strenuous efforts to 
ensure that national policies are not subverted or defied by local authorities in States with 
domestic constitutional arrangements, such as decentralized authority or devolution of powers. 
</p>
<p>16. States should take appropriate measures so that, wherever possible, persons belonging to 
minorities may have adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue or to have instruction in 
their mother tongue. These measures are most critical in preschool and primary schools, but may 
extend to subsequent stages of education. School curricula must encourage knowledge among all 
students of the history, traditions, language and culture of the minorities existing within their 
territory and also ensure minorities adequate opportunities to gain knowledge of the society as a 
whole. 
</p>
<p>17. In the field of education and minorities, there is a compelling need for accurate data that 
are qualitative and quantitative, disaggregated by sex, race, ethnicity and disability status in 
order to assess the necessary requirements in the development, institutionalization, 
implementation and monitoring of targeted education policies. Data should also be gathered on 
poverty status and on the access to education and progress of children who do not speak the 
dominant language. Indicators and benchmarks are necessary for the accurate appraisal of 
education policies, including assessments of the extent of discrimination against minorities and 
the success or failure of policies to eliminate discrimination. Such data should include research </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>into causes of poor school enrolment and drop-out rates where applicable. Disaggregation of the 
data according to sex will expose the barriers that prevent girls and women from accessing 
education and learning. All data should be made accessible to the public on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>18. Data-gathering exercises concerning minorities should take place in a culturally sensitive 
manner, on a voluntary basis, with full respect for the privacy and anonymity of the individuals 
concerned, and on the basis of their self-identification as members of groups concerned.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III. ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EFFECTIVE 
EDUCATION STRATEGY 
</b></p>
<p>19. States should approach the education of minorities in a positive spirit. Measures should be 
taken by States to implement education rights actively to the maximum of their available 
resources, individually and through international assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>20. States should review, enact and amend their legislation where necessary to affirm the right 
to education for all, eliminate discrimination and guarantee quality education for all members of 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>21. States should create conditions enabling institutions that are representative of minorities to 
participate in a meaningful way in the development and implementation of policies and 
programmes relating to education for minorities. 
</p>
<p>22. Budgetary policies are crucial to a State&#8217;s implementation of its obligations to respect, 
protect and fulfil the educational rights of minorities. In the drafting of budgets for education in 
the case of minorities, clear criteria that are tailored to the special needs of the minority group 
are required. The costing and financing of education policies should be based on a holistic 
appraisal of minority needs and on the basis of the State&#8217;s immediate and non-derogable 
obligation to guarantee that the right to education will be exercised without discrimination and 
on the basis of the principle of equal treatment. The principle of equal treatment entails the 
allocation of extra resources and efforts to advance the right to education among minority groups 
that have been victims of historical injustices or discrimination in realizing their right to 
education. 
</p>
<p>23. Budgetary allocations for education should be transparent and amenable to external 
scrutiny. Budgets should be presented in a form that allows assessment of the allocations 
disaggregated according to minority status and sex, rendering transparent the targeting of special 
measures for minority girls and minority boys. 
</p>
<p>24. Programmes for the education of minorities, as well as teachers and appropriate teaching 
and reading materials, including books, must be made available in the mother tongues of the 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>25. Educational services should be arranged in order that they reach minority communities 
throughout the national territory, and should be adequate to address the needs of such 
communities. States must ensure that educational services for minorities are delivered at a 
quality that is comparable with national standards. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>26. States should recognize that the adequate recruitment, training and incentivization of 
teachers to work in areas inhabited predominantly by members of minorities are factors of 
utmost importance in the delivery of adequate educational services, and should arrange teacher 
training programmes accordingly. 
</p>
<p>27. State or local policies or practices that, de jure or de facto, result in separate classes or 
schools for minority pupils, or schools or classes with grossly disproportionately high numbers 
of minority pupils, on a discriminatory basis, are prohibited, except in limited and exceptional 
circumstances. In particular, the misuse of psychological or learning ability tests for enrolment of 
children in primary schools must be subjected to close scrutiny with respect to their potential to 
engender discriminatory outcomes. The creation and development of classes and schools 
providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation, 
if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature. However, where separate 
educational institutions are established for minorities for linguistic, religious or cultural reasons, 
no barriers should be erected to prevent members of minority groups from studying at general 
educational institutions, should they or their families so wish. 
</p>
<p>28. Education should be available at all levels for minorities, from preschool to tertiary 
education, as should technical and vocational education, on a basis of equality with other 
learners. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION FOR MINORITIES 
</b>29. The principle of non-discrimination is a key to securing equal access to education, and 
ensuring ongoing participation and completion of quality education for members of 
disadvantaged and minority groups. 
</p>
<p>30. Members of minorities must have realistic and effective access to quality educational 
services, without discrimination, within the jurisdiction of the State. Accessibility has three 
overlapping dimensions: non-discrimination on prohibited grounds; physical accessibility; and 
economic accessibility. 
</p>
<p>31. Barriers to accessibility may be the result of single or multiple factors, whether physical or 
social, financial or pedagogical. States should address all such factors in order to promote 
effective access, especially in cases where barriers to access are compounded, as in the case of 
girl pupils, resulting in a vicious circle leading to severe educational exclusion. The existence of 
local customs that restrict the free movement of girls and women does not relieve the State of its 
responsibility to guarantee access to education for minority girls. 
</p>
<p>32.  Special attention to education is called for in the context of emergencies, armed conflicts 
and natural disasters when children of minorities or vulnerable populations do not have access to 
social protection and essential services, including education. Measures should be taken to avoid 
discrimination and favouritism during these periods and during periods of recovery and 
rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>33. Authorities should remove direct and indirect institutional barriers to education for 
minorities, and address cultural, gender and linguistic barriers that may have equivalent 
access-denying effects. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>34. In order to ensure effective access to education for members of minority communities, 
authorities should take immediate and positive steps to remove impediments resulting from 
poverty and child labour, homelessness, low nutrition levels, poor health and sanitation among 
the communities, as well as impediments that result from a policy of historical discrimination or 
injustice in realizing the right to education. 
</p><p>35. Difficulties in school enrolment and retention for displaced persons, members of nomadic 
or semi-nomadic groups, migrant workers and their children, both girls and boys, should be 
addressed in a proactive and constructive manner. Lack of documentation should not prevent 
pupils from enrolling in schools. 
</p>
<p>36. Enrolment and registration formalities and cost burdens should be eased to facilitate the 
admission of minority pupils into schools; such inhibiting factors may be a matter of deepened 
concern in relation to the admission of girl pupils. 
</p>
<p>37. Resources should be sufficient to guarantee that the education of their children is a 
financially viable proposition for minority families. 
</p>
<p>38. The impact of residential patterns on school enrolments should be carefully assessed and 
addressed to avoid disparate social and educational outcomes. Authorities should pay attention to 
the location of schools so that minority pupils are not disadvantaged with respect to physical 
access to school buildings or the quality of educational outcomes. 
</p>
<p>39. States should carefully monitor and take positive and effective steps to reduce high rates of 
exclusion and dropouts among minority students and to, de minimis, align them with rates of the 
majority population, in cooperation with parents, associations and communities. States should 
take effective steps to bring down any barriers to education, be they cultural, social, economic or 
of any other nature, that lead to high drop-out rates. 
</p>
<p>40. States should ensure equal access to education for women and girls from minority groups, 
upon whom poverty and family responsibilities may have a disproportionate impact, and who 
may be subject also to aggravated discrimination, including in extreme cases violence, on the 
basis of culture, gender or caste. 
</p>
<p>41. Affirmative action in education for members of minorities that have been subject to a 
policy of historical discrimination or injustices in realizing the right to education should extend 
to higher education, where the cumulative impact of discrimination at the lower levels of 
education often results in low levels of representation of members of minority groups in the later 
stages of education, whether as pupils or education professionals. 
</p>
<p>42. Programmes of adult education or &#8220;second chance&#8221; schools should be encouraged and 
increased for members of minorities who have not completed primary education levels. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 
</b></p>
<p>43. Education should work actively towards the elimination of prejudices among population 
groups and the promotion of mutual respect, understanding and tolerance among all persons 
residing in the State, whatever their ethnic, religious or cultural background or sex. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>44. Human rights education for all should be made an integral part of the national educational 
experience. 
</p>
<p>45. Teaching staff should be provided with initial and ongoing training preparing them to 
respond to the needs of pupils from a variety of backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>46. Teacher training, including training of teachers from minority communities, should include 
anti-discrimination, gender sensitive and intercultural training. 
</p>
<p>47. States should strive to ensure that the school learning environment for members of 
minorities is welcoming and receptive to their needs and concerns. 
</p>
<p>48. Systems of recording racist or similar incidents targeting minorities and policies to 
eliminate such incidents should be developed in school systems. 
</p>
<p>49. Disciplinary actions taken against students should be proportionate, fair and immune from 
any perception of bias against minority students. Positive disciplinary practices that do not 
conflict with the primary goals of student retention and educational outcomes should be 
employed. Disciplinary actions must respect the rights of parents to be fully informed, to 
participate in the decision-making process and to seek outside mediation. 
</p>
<p>50. States should act to remedy situations where there is a lack of trained teachers who speak 
minority languages. 
</p>
<p>51. States should actively strive to recruit and train teachers from minority communities, both 
men and women, at all levels of education as a key aspect of a strategy to develop a multicultural 
ethos in schools. 
</p>
<p>52. School management and administration should actively involve representatives from 
minority communities. 
</p>
<p>53. States should promote and systematize active consultation and cooperation between 
parents of children of minorities and the school authorities, including, where appropriate, 
through the employment of mediators to improve parent-school communication, and interpreters 
where parents do not speak the language of the school administration. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONTENT AND DELIVERY OF THE CURRICULUM 
</b></p>
<p>54. The form and substance of education, including curricula and teaching methods, must be 
acceptable to parents and children as relevant, culturally appropriate and of a quality equal to 
national standards. 
</p>
<p>55. The liberty of parents or legal guardians to choose educational institutions for their 
children other than those established by the authorities of the State and to ensure the religious 
and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions must be 
recognized. Such alternative institutions must comply, however, with the &#8220;minimum education </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>standards as may be laid down or approved by the State&#8221;.<b>2</b> Any State financing of non-State 
schools must be provided to all such schools on an equal basis. States should ensure that all 
parents are informed about the right to choose alternative educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>56. With regard to the right to manifest religion in schools or educational institutions, forums 
for continuous dialogue should be developed where necessary between members of religious 
minorities and educational institutions that serve them with the view to better understanding and 
accommodating their religious needs within schools. 
</p>
<p>57. In cases where members of minorities establish their own educational institutions, their 
right to do so should not be exercised in a manner that prevents them from understanding the 
culture and language of the national community as a whole and from participating in its 
activities. 
</p>
<p>58. States should provide adequate opportunities to persons belonging to minorities to learn 
their mother tongue or to learn through the medium of the mother tongue, alternatives which 
should not be understood as mutually exclusive. Specific forms of such opportunities should be 
chosen in consultation with persons belonging to minorities and taking into account their freely 
expressed wishes. 
</p>
<p>59. School language regimes for the initial stages of education in State schools should ideally 
employ the language of the child as the predominant medium of instruction, with a gradual 
introduction of the State language or dominant local language, if different from that of the child, 
at a later stage, where possible by bilingual teachers sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of 
minority children. 
</p>
<p>60. Education should be able to adapt to the situation of changing societies and communities 
and be responsive to the needs of students in diverse social and cultural settings. A diversity of 
learning systems should be considered so that quality formal and non-formal education that is 
contextualized, culture specific and relevant within an integrated system of education may be 
delivered. 
</p>
<p>61. Curricula should adequately reflect the diversity and plurality of society and the 
contribution of minorities to society. 
</p>
<p>62. Curricula should promote the preservation and defence of minority languages, and identify 
and equip members of minorities with the educational tools necessary for their full participation 
in the society concerned. 
</p>
<p>63. Curricula relating to minorities should be developed in cooperation with bodies 
representative of minorities, and members of minority groups should, ideally, be in positions of 
influence in education ministries or other authorities deciding upon curricula.
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>64. State education authorities should ensure that the general compulsory curriculum for all in 
the State includes teaching of the history, culture and traditions of the minorities from the 
perspective of the minorities themselves. States should take measures to teach the community 
narratives of minorities to other groups. 
</p>
<p>65. The promotion of the cultural rights of minorities is necessary to further the fulfilment of 
their educational rights. These rights include access to written, audio and visual media materials 
in their own language in order to enrich the cultural lives of minorities. There must also be the 
free exchange of books and other educational materials and access to universities run by 
members of their national group in other States.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Educational curricula should not include materials that stereotype or demean minorities, 
including compounded stereotyping of minority girls and women on the basis of both their 
national or ethnic belonging and their sex. Teachers and other education personnel should avoid 
the use of offensive names for an individual or a community or names not freely chosen by the 
individual or community concerned. Educational curricula taught to non-minority groups within 
the State should include materials designed to reduce stereotypes and racist attitudes towards 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>67. Members of the general population should have the opportunity to learn minority 
languages and thereby contribute to the strengthening of tolerance and cultural interchange 
within the State.
