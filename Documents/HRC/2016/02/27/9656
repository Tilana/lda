<p><b>I.  Resolution adopted by the Council at its ninth special session 
</b></p>
<p><b>S-9/1 The grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian  
Territory, particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks  
against the occupied Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging </i>that peace, security, development and human rights are the pillars of the 
United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and the inadmissibility 
of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>the applicability of international human rights law to the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming also </i>the applicability of international humanitarian law, namely the 
Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the obligations of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that each High Contracting Party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to 
the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is under the obligation to respect and ensure 
the respect for the obligations arising from that Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the right to life constitutes the most fundamental of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing serious</i> <i>concern</i> at the lack of implementation by the occupying Power, Israel, 
of previously adopted resolutions and recommendations of the Council relating to the human 
rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the massive ongoing Israeli military operation in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, has caused grave violations of the human 
rights of the Palestinian civilians therein, exacerbated the severe humanitarian crisis in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermined international efforts towards achieving a just and 
lasting peace in the region,  </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-9/2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p><i> Condemning </i>all forms of violence against civilians and deploring the loss of human lives 
in the context of the current situation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the Israeli siege imposed on the occupied Gaza Strip, including the 
closure of border crossings and the cutting of the supply of fuel, food and medicine, constitutes 
collective punishment of Palestinian civilians and leads to disastrous humanitarian and 
environmental consequences, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the ongoing Israeli military operation carried out in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, which has resulted in massive 
violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people and systematic destruction of Palestinian 
infrastructure; </p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> the immediate cessation of Israeli military attacks throughout the 
Palestinian Occupied Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, which to date have 
resulted in the killing of more than nine hundred and injury to more than four thousand 
Palestinians, including a large number of women and children, and the end to the launching of 
crude rockets against Israeli civilians, which have resulted in the loss of four civilian lives and 
some injuries; 
 3. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, immediately withdraw its military forces 
from the occupied Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> the occupying Power, Israel, to end its occupation of all Palestinian lands 
occupied since 1967 and to respect its commitment within the peace process towards the 
establishment of the independent sovereign Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, 
living in peace and security with all its neighbours; </p>
<p> 5. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, stop the targeting of civilians and medical 
facilities and staff and the systematic destruction of the cultural heritage of the Palestinian 
people, in addition to the destruction of  public and private properties, as laid down in the 
Fourth Geneva Convention; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also demands </i>that the occupying Power, Israel, lift its siege, open all borders  to 
allow access and free movement of humanitarian aid to the occupied Gaza Strip, including the 
immediate establishment of humanitarian corridors, in compliance with its obligations under 
international humanitarian law, and ensure free access of the media to areas of conflict through 
media corridors; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to support the current initiative aiming at 
putting an immediate end to the current military aggression in Gaza; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls for</i> urgent international action to put an immediate end to the grave violations 
committed by the occupying Power, Israel, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in 
the occupied Gaza Strip; </p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls for</i> immediate international protection of the Palestinian people in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, in compliance with international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/S-9/2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Urges </i>all parties concerned to respect the rules of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against the civilian population; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the 
violations of human rights of the Palestinian people by the occupying Power, Israel, by:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Strengthening the field presence of the Office of the High Commission in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, and deploying the 
necessary personnel and expertise to monitor and document Israeli violations of the human rights 
of Palestinians and the destruction of their properties; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Submitting periodic reports to the Council on the implementation of the present 
resolution; </p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests</i> all relevant special procedures mandate holders, in particular the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children

expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, to urgently seek and gather

to the Council at its next session; </p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests </i>the occupying Power, Israel, to fully cooperate with all the 
above-mentioned special procedures mandate holders and to desist from any further hindrance to 
the work of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Decides</i> to dispatch an urgent, independent international fact-finding mission, to be 
appointed by the President of the Council, to investigate all violations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the 
Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied 
Gaza Strip, due to the current aggression, and calls upon Israel not to obstruct the process of 
investigation and to fully cooperate with the mission; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all 
administrative, technical and logistical assistance required to enable the above-mentioned special 
procedures mandate holders and the fact-finding mission to fulfil their mandates promptly and

</b></p>
<p><b>Administrative and programme budget implications of the resolution 
adopted by the Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>Oral statement made by the Secretariat in connection  
with draft resolution A/HRC/S-9/L.1 
</b></p>
<p>1. The draft resolution presented to the Council contains proposals for activities that will 
require an analysis and review of the level of resources required to implement them. Owing to 
the brief duration of the ninth special session, the Secretariat is not in a position to prepare and 
present the related statement of administrative and financial implications of the draft resolution 
within the requisite 48-hour period. 
</p>
<p>2. The present statement is made to inform the Council that no provision has been included 
under section 23, Human Rights, or other sections of the programme budget for the biennium 
2008-2009 for these activities, and thus additional appropriations will likely be requested. The 
Secretariat will carry out, in due course, a thorough review of the implications of the revised 
draft resolution, and a written statement containing a detailed analysis of the programme budget 
implications will be submitted to the General Assembly when it considers the resolutions of the 
Council.  </p>
