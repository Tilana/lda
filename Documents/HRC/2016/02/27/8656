<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 12/13 concerning human rights and indigenous peoples, the Human 
Rights Council requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to the 
Council an annual report on the rights of indigenous peoples containing information on 
relevant developments of human rights bodies and mechanisms and activities undertaken by 
the Office of the High Commissioner at Headquarters and in the field that contribute to the 
promotion of and respect for, and the full application of, the provisions of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and follow-up the effectiveness 
of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report focuses particularly on some illustrative examples of the activities 
and the initiatives undertaken at headquarters and by field presences that contribute to the 
full application of the rights of indigenous peoples and presents an overview of the recent 
developments undertaken by the United Nations treaty bodies and the Human Rights 
Council special procedures and mechanisms including the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) continued to work for the promotion and the full application of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The rights of indigenous 
peoples have continued to be a priority issue for the High Commissioner, and indigenous 
issues figure prominently in her new Strategic Management Plan. The Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples is a shared tool and framework for action in this area. 
</p>
<p>4. The sections below illustrate some of the activities implemented by the Office in its 
effort to strengthen the promotion and implementation of the declaration. These do not aim 
to offer an exhaustive overview of the work of OHCHR on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, but 
rather to provide some examples of the action taken at country, regional and headquarters 
levels. At a global level, the Office continued to service the Expert Mechanism on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples by, inter alia, supporting the preparation and organization of 
the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s annual sessions and organizing technical workshops in 2009 and 
2010 to contribute to its thematic studies. OHCHR produced a number of awareness-raising 
tools concerning the rights of indigenous peoples and related mechanisms. For example, it 
cooperated with the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs to produce an 
awareness-raising video on the work of the Expert Mechanism, available on the Internet 
and as a DVD. 
</p>
<p>5. OHCHR also continued to manage the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations to support the participation of indigenous organizations in the 
sessions of the Expert Mechanism and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, while 
also examining, as requested by the Human Rights Council, the practical implications of a 
possible extension of the mandate of the fund to cover sessions of the treaty bodies and 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Country engagement 
</b></p>
<p>6. Activities carried out in relation to indigenous issues in the field included 
monitoring, support to legal reform, technical cooperation activities, capacity-building and 
awareness-raising. The Millennium Development Goals and the advocacy work and efforts </p>


<p>aimed at disseminating the outcomes and recommendations of all United Nations human 
rights mechanisms also offered entry points for field presences to engage in work on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Monitoring activities and support for mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>7. Several field presences monitored cases of violations of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
OHCHR-Mexico followed several cases of violence against indigenous women, focusing 
specially on their right to land and natural resources, access to justice and the recognition of 
their own normative systems. When drafting a thematic report on the situation of human 
rights defenders, OHCHR-Mexico identified the specific challenges that indigenous human 
rights defenders were facing while undertaking their activities.  
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR-Colombia continued to pay close attention to the situation of indigenous 
peoples and several cases of killings of indigenous persons. In 2009, it monitored, at the 
request of the President of Colombia, the criminal investigations of the Attorney General 
regarding the killing of members of an indigenous community. It ensured the presence of 
the Office during the investigation and provided recommendations which were shared with 
relevant high officials and included the protection of survivors, witnesses and their families, 
as well as the immediate implementation of a safeguard plan for threatened indigenous 
peoples.  
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR-Nepal followed-up on several cases of ill-treatment of indigenous peoples 
by park authorities. It continued to monitor protests and rallies and facilitate dialogue 
between indigenous peoples and others concerned. In addition, the Office conducted a 
mission in Sankhuwasabha district to assess steps taken by the Government to meet its 
commitments and responsibilities to protect the rights of affected indigenous peoples in the 
implementation of a mega-hydroelectric project, and ensure that they participate in the 
decision-making concerning any project-related activities.  
</p>
<p>10. OHCHR-Cambodia has continued to monitor the impact of economic land 
concessions for agro-industrial purposes, such as rubber plantations, on indigenous peoples 
and small-scale farmers. Often concessions were granted on indigenous land without due 
regard to the rights of the affected community and, most importantly, without respecting the 
requirement to consult with indigenous communities and conduct an environmental and 
social impact assessment.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR field presences also consistently supported the work of special procedures 
mandate holders. In particular, the Regional Office for the Pacific provided substantive 
support for the preparation of the mission of Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people to Australia and included the 
resulting recommendations in its advocacy plan for Australia. The Regional Office also met 
with indigenous health workers prior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
to collect information and provide meaningful advice in the preparation of the mission. The 
Regional Office for Central America and that for Southern Africa in Pretoria provided 
assistance to the missions of the Special Rapporteur on human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people in his missions in Panama, Peru and Kenya, while the 
Human Rights Adviser in the Russian Federation provided assistance to the Special 
Rapporteur for the preparation of his visit there.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Technical cooperation activities and thematic work 
</b></p>
<p>12. OHCHR continued its work on a range of key themes pertaining to indigenous 
peoples. One such thematic initiative is the preparation of guidelines concerning indigenous 
peoples in isolation or in initial contact in the Amazon region and Gran Chaco. This work </p>


<p>was initiated further to a General Assembly recommendation made in the context of the 
Programme of Action for the Second International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous 
People in 2006, as well as subsequent recommendations by the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues.  
</p>
<p>13. In the last 18 months, the Office has taken a number of steps, in cooperation with the 
Institute for the Promotion of Social Studies (IPES) and the International Work Group for 
Indigenous Affairs with financial support from Spanish Development Cooperation 
(AECID), towards the completion of guidelines on the issue. It invited the seven 
Governments concerned to comment on the draft (the draft guidelines are contained in 
document A/HRC/EMRIP/2009/6) and organized a series of national consultations: in 
March 2010 in Ecuador and Colombia, in May 2010 in Paraguay and Brazil and in July 
2010 in Bolivia, to which the relevant governmental ministries and departments, indigenous 
peoples, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), experts and representatives of the United 
Nations system were invited. These national consultations have allowed the Office to 
further elaborate the guidelines under three headings which clarify key concepts; set out the 
normative framework drawing on existing instruments, including the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples and International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 
169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries of 1989 (which 
has been ratified by all the countries concerned) and case-law from the international and 
inter-American human rights systems; and propose a policy framework or action plan for 
consideration by Governments. 
</p>
<p>14.  A final regional meeting will take place in August 2010 in the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia, under the auspices of the Government, to review the latest version of the guidelines 
and consider options for their implementation. It is planned that the guidelines, together 
with examples of best practice and publications on isolated and initially contacted 
indigenous peoples, will be finalized towards the end of 2010.  
</p>
<p>15.  OHCHR-Mexico provided technical assistance to the Secretariat of Indigenous 
Peoples in the State of Michoac&#225;n regarding the preparation of a constitutional amendment 
aimed at protecting the rights of indigenous peoples to be considered by the local congress. 
It also advised on a local law related to the rights and culture of indigenous peoples which 
will accompany the constitutional reform, and assisted Mexico City&#8217;s executive and 
legislative branches in a process to consult indigenous peoples living in the city on the 
drafting a local law on their rights. These activities seek to guarantee that legislation is 
accordance with international human rights standards, including the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>16.  Furthermore, OHCHR-Mexico has engaged with the national human rights 
institution and the National Institute for Statistics and Geography in a process of 
consolidating human rights indicators, which will be disaggregated by indigenous origin 
after a validation process. OHCHR-Mexico also offered its assistance to the Mexican 
Supreme Court to ensure that its rulings are consistent with international human rights 
standards regarding cases related, in particular, to the right to land and the right to be 
consulted. 
</p>
<p>17.  OHCHR-Cambodia offered its assistance and legal advice to provincial and local 
authorities, indigenous communities and NGOs in order to protect communities&#8217; access to 
land and resources. It has worked with selected companies to encourage them to apply 
standards of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, beyond mere respect of 
national law. For instance, prompted by the Office&#8217;s legal advice, in 2009 one multinational 
company which had been granted a rubber concession conducted an additional, extensive 
environmental and social impact assessment, including an analysis on how the Declaration 
applied to its rubber plantation. It has since conducted consultations with the affected </p>


<p>indigenous community and designed projects to mitigate the impact of the plantation on 
peoples&#8217; livelihood and land.  
</p>
<p>18.  In Nepal, the Durban Review Conference Follow-up Committee, established with 
the support of the OHCHR-Nepal, held a meeting with the country&#8217;s Prime Minister in 
January 2010 and submitted a memorandum that includes the concerns of indigenous 
peoples and calls for the effective implementation of the ILO Convention No. 169 and the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. OHCHR-Nepal further followed-up with 
the Government on recommendations by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination so as to ensure effective and meaningful participation of indigenous peoples 
in the ongoing constitution-making process.  
</p>
<p>19.  In Cameroon, the OHCHR Regional Office for Central Africa provided advice to the 
Ministry of Social Affairs in the preparation of a draft law on the rights of marginalized 
populations, advocating for a dedicated law to recognize and protect the rights of 
indigenous peoples in Cameroon. The human rights and challenges faced by indigenous 
peoples in Cameroon were raised during the drafting of the United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework for Cameroon. The Office also made a technical contribution to the 
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) preparation of a negotiation strategy for formal 
agreements of joint management of the national park of Campo Ma&#8217;an in eastern Cameroon 
between local indigenous peoples and the local administration in April 2009. 
</p>
<p>20.  The Human Rights Adviser in Ecuador, in close cooperation with the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights, has been working on the issue of coordination between ordinary 
and indigenous systems of justice with a view to preparing a draft law on the issue. It also 
developed training modules on indigenous justice addressed to police, military national 
institutions and justice officials and organized pilot training workshops to validate the 
contents of the modules.  
</p>
<p>21.  In the same vein, OHCHR-Bolivia provided technical advice to the Ministry of 
Justice on legal pluralism and indigenous justice. It also jointly organized, with the Ministry 
of Autonomies, an international seminar on indigenous autonomy and its human rights 
implications. Both activities contributed to improving understanding and implementation of 
key reform proposals relating to indigenous peoples, including provisions of the new 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>22.  In the context of the project to contribute to the eradication of racism and ethnic and 
gender discrimination, particularly against indigenous women, OHCHR-Guatemala 
supported the design and launching of the second phase of the National Campaign for 
Coexistence in Cultural Diversity, entitled &#8220;Indigenous women have rights; we demand that 
they are met&#8221;. It further disseminated, together with the Social Studies and Research 
Association (ASIES), recommendations contained in the OHCHR-ASIES study &#8220;Access to 
justice for indigenous peoples from a human rights-based approach: Perspectives from 
indigenous law and from the official justice system&#8221;, particularly to representatives of the 
judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Capacity-building activities 
</b></p>
<p>23.  OHCHR in Geneva has stepped up its efforts to encourage the use of the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the work of national human rights institutions. In 
December 2009, it organized an expert meeting in Bangkok, bringing together selected 
national human rights institutions, indigenous representatives and human rights bodies 
resulting in concrete proposals that are now being followed up. 
</p>
<p>24. During the period under review, the Office continued to implement its indigenous 
fellowship programme (which has four linguistic components) and provided in-depth 
training sessions on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to 23 indigenous </p>


<p>representatives from 15 countries, with the help of other United Nations agencies, including 
ILO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the 
United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO). It also developed national fellowship programmes at the country level. In 2009, 
indigenous fellows from the programmes were posted with OHCHR-Guatemala and in 
Moscow, contributing to the work there on indigenous issues. 
</p>
<p>25.  OHCHR, both at headquarters and through its field presences, continued to provide 
support for networking and capacity-building of indigenous communities. OHCHR has 
partnered with ILO to organize a series of workshops in cooperation with its Regional 
Office for Central Africa in the central African regions, with a view to promoting 
legislative and policy change on indigenous issues through the facilitation of dialogue 
between Governments and indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>26.  In collaboration with UNDP, OHCHR-Mexico conducted several workshops on the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which brought 
together representatives of different indigenous communities. The OHCHR Regional Office 
for Central America in Panama also provided support by co-sponsoring a regional seminar 
on the right to adequate housing and the prohibition of forced evictions, and a workshop for 
indigenous women in Panama to discuss challenges to the enjoyment of individual and 
collective rights and possible cooperation with regional and international human rights 
mechanisms. OHCHR-Nepal partnered with ILO to organize workshops on the rights of 
indigenous peoples focusing on conceptual clarity on the right to self-determination and the 
right to free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>27.  In order to promote better understanding of the rights of indigenous peoples in the 
subregion, the Regional Office for South-East Asia in Bangkok, in cooperation with UNDP, 
organized two interactive regional dialogues focusing on the Declaration and bringing 
together relevant partners, including the United Nations resident coordinators and other 
United Nations representatives from the South-East Asia region, and civil society 
representatives to discuss challenges and best practices in implementing the provisions of 
the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>28. The Human Rights Adviser in the Russian Federation continued to build the 
capacity of indigenous peoples by facilitating training sessions in Moscow and Geneva on 
international and national human rights systems for eight representatives of indigenous 
communities from Russian Federation, under the auspices of the OHCHR Russian-speaking 
fellowship programme.  
</p>
<p>29. OHCHR-Cambodia has been advocating with development partners and national 
institutions better implementation of the national framework protecting indigenous land, 
including titling indigenous land.  
</p>
<p>30. In Cameroon, the OHCHR Regional Office for Central Africa continued its 
collaboration with indigenous peoples in the region. The Centre built the capacity of civil 
society organizations, providing technical expertise and advisory services to representatives 
of indigenous communities, international NGOs, Governments and United Nations system 
partners from Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Rwanda. Representatives of local administrations, park 
authorities and local NGOs received training on the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and the principle of free, prior and informed consent and other human 
rights standards in April 2009. 
</p>
<p>31. A dialogue between the Batwa communities and local authorities was successfully 
established in Burundi, resulting in an increase in the enrolment rates of Batwa children in 
schools and improvements in their access to lands. The Human Rights Adviser for the Great </p>


<p>Lakes Region also continued to provide ongoing technical advice on the electoral process, 
including their political rights and participation, as well as their economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>32. In addition, OHCHR Regional Office for Central America in Panama assisted 
United Nations country teams in their efforts to further integrate the promotion and 
protection of indigenous peoples into their work. It organized in Nicaragua a specific 
training for country team staff members on the United Nations Development Group 
Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Issues (in partnership with other United Nations 
agencies) and a training session for trainers on the right to food, focusing on indigenous 
peoples and Afro-descendants, for 27 staff from the country team in Panama.  
</p>
<p>33. Many OHCHR field presences facilitated the use of human rights treaty bodies. 
OHCHR-Cambodia has helped indigenous peoples and organizations to submit a parallel 
report to the Committee on the Elimination Racial Discrimination. The Committee&#8217;s 
recommendations were translated into Khmer and the Office also supported related follow-
up activities. OHCHR-Mexico helped a number of indigenous individuals and 
organizations draft communications to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people.  
</p>
<p>34. By providing technical advice, the OHCHR Regional Office for Central America 
strengthened the capacity of indigenous communities and organizations to bring allegations 
of human rights violations to the attention of the Special Rapporteur and the inter-American 
system for the protection of human rights. OHCHR-Nepal provided an introduction to the 
universal periodic review process for a large number of indigenous peoples and ensured 
that indigenous peoples&#8217; issues were integrated in the national report by supporting 
consultations on indigenous issues at all levels. It also helped establish a Durban Review 
Conference follow-up committee &#8211; composed of marginalized groups including indigenous 
peoples &#8211; which prepared a separate stakeholders&#8217; submission to the universal periodic 
review.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Awareness-raising tools 
</b></p>
<p>35.  Several field presences produced quality materials to raise awareness of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and promote better understanding thereof 
and contribute to the full application of its provisions. OHCHR-Mexico initiated a study on 
the rights of indigenous peoples to be consulted in the context of large-scale development 
projects. The study, undertaken in consultation with indigenous peoples, federal and local 
authorities, academics and United Nations agencies, aimed at identifying practical 
guidelines for the implementation in Mexico of the right to be consulted and should be 
made available at the end of 2010. 
</p>
<p>36.  The Human Rights Adviser for the Great Lakes Region, together with the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), carried out an extensive 
study to identify stateless persons in Burundi. The study has helped to further raise 
awareness of the need to provide the Batwa community with national identification 
documents, thereby ensuring their enjoyment of civic and political rights and access to 
public services.  
</p>
<p>37. In order to disseminate information on the human rights of indigenous peoples, the 
OHCHR Regional Office for Central Africa continued to manage an Internet information 
network for more than 4,000 individuals, mainly indigenous leaders from Central Africa 
and other countries who receive and exchange information on indigenous and minority 
issues in the subregion. Information was circulated and shared on indigenous fellowships at 
OHCHR, local NGO initiatives for the promotion of indigenous rights, invitations to 
seminars, sharing of reports and calls for proposals. The Office also participated in the </p>


<p>second official celebration of the International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People in 
Cameroon on 9 August 2009. 
</p>
<p>38.  The OHCHR Regional Office for Central America in Panama prepared training tools 
on the rights of indigenous peoples, including a comparison between the ILO Convention 
No. 169 and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Human Rights 
Adviser in Ecuador supported the production of a number of publications to promote the 
rights of indigenous peoples, while OHCHR-Columbia published a guide on the right to 
free, prior and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>39.  A number of field presences published the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples in indigenous languages. OHCHR-Mexico translated the Declaration into nine 
indigenous languages in collaboration with UNDP and the National Commission for 
Development in Mexico. OHCHR-Cambodia supported the translation and publication of 
the Declaration into Khmer and OHCHR-Nepal translated the Declaration into nine 
languages. In 2009, the Office also widely disseminated its pocket-sized Nepali version of 
the Declaration. The Office of the Human Rights Adviser in the Russian Federation 
translated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into some ten languages of 
indigenous peoples of the Federation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Inter-agency programmes and activities 
</b></p>
<p>40.  At the global level, OHCHR continued to participate in the Inter-Agency Support 
Group on Indigenous Issues. It participated in its annual meeting in September 2009 and 
made a substantial contribution to an inter-agency meeting called by the Secretariat of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity and the Working Group on Indicators of the 
International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity, to discuss indicators of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; well-being and sustainable development, focusing on traditional knowledge. It was 
felt during the meeting that the existing work by OHCHR was of particular relevance to the 
work on indicators for indigenous peoples and that the structural process outcome approach 
developed by OHCHR could be used to identify indicators to help measure the 
implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>41.  In May 2010, OHCHR established, with ILO and UNDP, the United Nations 
Indigenous Peoples Partnership (UNIPP) as a framework for the promotion and protection 
of the rights of indigenous peoples at the country level. A multi-donor trust fund will 
support global, regional and local initiatives and programmes devoted, inter alia, to 
promoting consultative and participatory mechanisms. OHCHR also continued its work 
with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) under the United 
Nations Housing Rights Programme and contributed to a joint publication on urban 
indigenous peoples and migration.  
</p>
<p>42.  At the country level, the OHCHR Regional Office in Central America in Panama led 
the work of an inter-agency working group on indigenous issues, composed of nine United 
Nations agencies. The working group undertook a series of activities, including two 
regional seminars on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples gathering human 
rights bodies and mechanisms, national human rights institutions and indigenous 
organizations from Central America and the Caribbean, a meeting of focal points on 
indigenous issues from 12 national human rights institutions of Latin America to discuss 
best practices and challenges in monitoring and implementing the Declaration, and the 
establishment of a regional consultative working group on indigenous peoples as a 
mechanism of consultation between indigenous peoples and United Nations agencies. </p>


<p><b> III. Human rights bodies and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p> <b>A. Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Studies and research-based advice 
</b></p>
<p>43. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 9/7, the expert mechanism prepared a 
study on lessons learned and challenges to achieving the implementation of the right of 
indigenous peoples to education (A/HRC/12/33). The study encompasses (a) a human 
rights-based analysis of the scope and content of the right to education; (b) indigenous 
education systems and institutions; (c) lessons learned; (d) challenges and measures to 
achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education; and (e) Expert 
Mechanism advice No. 1 on the right of indigenous peoples to education. It was submitted 
to the Council at its twelfth session together with the report of the mechanism&#8217;s 2009 
session, which contained proposals to the Council for its consideration and approval, in 
particular concerning a thematic study on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to participate in 
decision-making. 
</p>
<p>44.  In its resolution 12/13, the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to carry out a 
study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, and to present 
a progress report to the Council at its fifteenth session and a final study to the eighteenth 
session. The expert mechanism has prepared an advanced version of the progress report to 
be discussed at its third session in July 2010. A large number of national human rights 
institutions, United Nations agencies and NGOs, as well as the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, provided 
substantive input to the progress report.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>45.  The expert mechanism participated in various activities with a view to enhancing 
cooperation with and avoiding duplicating the work of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, in accordance with paragraph 5 of Council 
resolution 6/36. The expert mechanism has participated actively in the eighth and ninth 
sessions of the Permanent Forum, while the Special Rapporteur and representatives of the 
Permanent Forum attended and contributed to the second and third annual sessions of the 
expert mechanism.  
</p>
<p>46.  In addition, the expert mechanism participated in the International seminar of 
experts on Implementing Indigenous Peoples Rights on the role of the United Nations 
mechanisms with specific mandate regarding the rights of indigenous peoples, organized by 
the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs and the Alm&#225;ciga Intercultural Group 
in 2009, and the meeting of the three United Nations Mechanisms with a specific mandate 
to address indigenous issues and their secretariats, organized in January 2010 by OHCHR 
and the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 
</p>
<p>47.  The expert mechanism further made a substantial contribution to the work of the 
Permanent Forum by taking part in the two international expert group meetings organized 
by the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum, respectively on the role of the United Nations 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in the implementation of article 42 of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (January 2009) and indigenous 
peoples &#8211; development with culture and identity &#8211; articles 3 and 32 of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (January 2010). <b> </b></p>


<p><b> B. Special procedures and treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people 
</b></p>
<p>48.  The Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people has engaged in a range of activities within the terms of his 
mandate to monitor the human rights situation of indigenous peoples worldwide and 
improve their situations in accordance with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and other relevant international instruments. These activities will be presented in 
more detail in his report to the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/15/37).  
</p>
<p>49.  Overall, the Special Rapporteur has tried to develop work methods oriented towards 
a constructive dialogue with Governments, indigenous peoples, NGOs, relevant United 
Nations agencies and other actors, in order to address challenging issues and situations and 
build on advances already made.  
</p>
<p>50.  The various activities that he has carried out in this spirit can be described as falling 
within four, interrelated spheres of activity: promoting good practices; thematic studies; 
country reports; and cases of alleged human rights violations. The Special Rapporteur has 
also sought to advance the endorsement of the Declaration by those States that did not vote 
for its adoption by the General Assembly in 2007. 
</p>
<p>51.  Related to the promotion of good practices is the work of the Special Rapporteur in 
conducting or participating in studies on issues or themes that are of interest to indigenous 
peoples across borders and regions of the world. The Special Rapporteur further continued 
to contribute to the work of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>52.  Additionally, the Special Rapporteur carried out visits to several countries for the 
purpose of developing reports to assess the human rights conditions of indigenous peoples 
in those countries, including visits to Australia, Chile, Colombia, the Russian Federation 
and, most recently, to the S&#225;pmi region, the traditional territory of the Sami people, in the 
Nordic countries.  
</p>
<p>53.  An ongoing aspect of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work involves receiving and, in 
appropriate cases, acting upon information of alleged violations of the rights of indigenous 
peoples in specific situations provided to the Special Rapporteur by indigenous peoples and 
their organizations, NGOs and other sources. The Special Rapporteur also held separate 
meetings with indigenous representatives to receive communications during the annual 
sessions of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>54.  The Special Rapporteur has made a concerted effort to engage constructively with 
Governments about credible information of alleged human rights violations in specific 
cases, carrying out on-site visits to examine particular cases, such as his visit to Peru in July 
2009 to assess the tragic events around the Bagua incidents.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>55.  During the period under review, several special rapporteurs have addressed the 
concerns of indigenous peoples as part of their regular activities. In his statement to the 
second session of the International Conference on Chemicals Management held in Geneva 
in May 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the illicit movement and 
dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights 
highlighted that a rights-based approach to chemicals management must include the 
involvement of indigenous peoples (one of the vulnerable groups negatively impacted by </p>


<p>chemical products) in the design, implementation and monitoring of chemicals management 
strategies and policies affecting them. 
</p>
<p>56.  In her mission report to the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in November 2009 
(A/HRC/13/40/Add.4), the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief focused on 
beliefs and customs of animists or ancestor worshippers, mainly of members of Lao hill 
indigenous tribes. While giving an overview of such beliefs and customs, the Special 
Rapporteur focused on the possible human rights implications of some harmful traditions 
and cruel practices by these indigenous tribes.  
</p>
<p>57.  During his visit to Australia in November 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the right 
of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health considered, inter alia, the issues related to access to health services of indigenous 
peoples. The Special Rapporteur assessed the impact of poor socio-economic conditions 
and neglect and under-resourcing on the enjoyment of the right to health of indigenous 
peoples. He also considered educational attainment, access to basic amenities, health 
workforce and political participation, and recent Government initiatives concerning 
indigenous welfare. 
</p>
<p>58.  The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context addressed 
the situation of adequate housing of indigenous peoples in some of the countries she visited. 
In Canada, she addressed the issue of access to land of indigenous peoples and the situation 
of indigenous women at risk of exploitation by landlords and gangs. In the United States of 
America, she expressed her concerns about the dire housing situation faced by some Native 
American tribes. In her follow-up report to country recommendations, she addressed the 
issue of access to adequate housing and to land of indigenous peoples in Mexico, as well as 
the situation of indigenous women in rural areas in Peru. Likewise, in another follow-up 
report to country recommendations (A/HRC/13/20/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur 
addressed the issue of access to land, water and natural resources of indigenous peoples, 
and the titling of indigenous lands, in Brazil and Cambodia. Indigenous issued were also 
examined in her thematic work; the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on climate change and the 
right to adequate housing stressed that adaptation assistance must be tailored to ensure that 
its benefits reach indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>59.  The Special Rapporteur on the right to food has made specific references to the 
rights of indigenous peoples, in particular in relation to access and use of land. In June 
2009, he proposed eleven minimum human rights principles applicable to large-scale land 
acquisitions or leases, one of which is specifically devoted to indigenous peoples (see 
A/HRC/13/33/Add.2). It provides that &#8220;under international law, indigenous peoples have 
been granted specific forms of protection of their rights to land. States shall consult and 
cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned in order to obtain their free 
and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories 
and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or 
exploitation of mineral, water or other resources&#8221;. During his missions to Guatemala, 
Nicaragua and Brazil in September and October 2009, the Special Rapporteur paid 
particular attention to the rights of indigenous people. In each case, he made specific 
recommendations to the State party concerned to strengthen the protection of indigenous 
people's access to land. The Rapporteur has also undertaken a study on the access to land 
and the right to food, which will be published in his report to the sixty-fifth session of the 
General Assembly. He intends to devote a section of this report to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>60.  During his visit to Paraguay in 2009 (see A/HRC/14/25/Add.2), the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education closely examined the situation of education of 
indigenous peoples and focused, in particular, on the illiteracy rate of indigenous peoples. </p>


<p>61.  Special procedure mandate holders have also addressed the situation of indigenous 
peoples by sending communications to Governments based on allegations of human rights 
violations brought to their attention by various sources. From January 2009 to April 2010, 
36 communications dealing with indigenous rights were sent by 15 mandate holders to 36 
countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America. 
</p>
<p> <b>3. Activities of treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>62.  The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination continued to pay 
particular attention to the situation of indigenous peoples in its early warning and urgent 
action procedure, general recommendations and its consideration of the reports by State 
parties.  
</p>
<p>63.  During the period under review, concluding observations and recommendations 
concerning the rights of indigenous peoples were addressed to 14 State parties to the 
Convention. The Committee also issued letters of concerns regarding the situation of 
indigenous peoples in 12 countries under its early warning and urgent action procedure.  
</p>
<p>64.  It further issued its general recommendation No. 32 on the meaning and scope of 
special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, clarifying that &#8220;special measures should not be confused with specific 
rights pertaining to certain categories of person or community, such as[&#8230;] the rights of 
indigenous peoples [&#8230;]. Such rights are permanent rights, recognized as such in human 
rights instruments, including those adopted in the context of the United Nations and its 
agencies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>65.  During its review of States parties&#8217; periodic reports, the Committee regretted the 
lack of information from a number of State parties on the ethnic and linguistic make-up of 
the population, including indigenous peoples, which would enable both the Committee and 
the State party to better assess the implementation of the Convention at the national level. It 
also recommended that States concerned provide disaggregated statistical information 
regarding access to education, health and public services and emphasized that data was 
necessary to ensure the application of adequate legislation to ensure equal enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights by indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>66.  In particular, the Committee reiterated its recommendation that State parties take 
steps to give adequate recognition to native languages and seek strategies with a view to 
introducing bilingual education. It further recommended that State parties concerned ensure 
the effective protection with regard to recruitment and conditions of employment of 
workers belonging to indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>67.  In its concluding observations to one State party, it recommended that the State 
concerned redouble its efforts to ensure that all births among indigenous peoples are 
registered and that those registered are provided with personal identity documents. It also 
encouraged the State party to bring civil status registration centres closer to the 
communities where indigenous peoples live. 
</p>
<p>68.  On several occasions, the Committee expressed great concern about the lack of 
consultation of indigenous peoples prior to land concessions and noted that the rights of 
indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and exploit their lands and resources were not 
guaranteed. It drew the State parties&#8217; attention to general recommendation No. 23 on the 
rights of indigenous peoples which, inter alia, calls upon State parties to recognize and 
protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their communal 
lands, territories and resources. The Committee further encouraged corporate business 
entities when engaging in economic land concessions to take into consideration their 
corporate social responsibility as it relates to the rights and well-being of local populations. </p>


<p>69.  The Committee reiterated its concern regarding a number of displacements of 
indigenous peoples from their traditional lands. It recommended to one State party to take 
the necessary measure to accelerate the process of restitution of ancestral lands to the 
indigenous peoples and to put in place a mechanism tasked with the recognition of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to lands and natural resources. It further encouraged another 
State party to continue negotiations with relevant ministries on the establishment of a new 
preparatory body in charge of reaching a solution in a land use dispute affecting indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>70.  While noting efforts of some State parties to conduct consultations with affected 
indigenous communities, the Committee further recommended that, when taking legislative 
or administrative decisions which may affect the rights and interests of indigenous peoples, 
the State parties endeavour to consult and obtain their informed consent. In its concluding 
observation to one State party, the Committee recommended that the State party adopt and 
implement in a concerted manner legislation which regulated the rights to prior consultation 
in order to ensure that all prior consultations were undertaken in a manner which respected 
the free and informed consent of the affected community.  
</p>
<p>71.  The Committee also deplored the non-existence of specific legislative framework to 
guarantee the realization of the collective rights of indigenous peoples. It urged the State 
parties concerned to ensure legal acknowledgement of the collective rights of indigenous 
peoples to own and use their lands and resources according to customary laws and 
traditional land-tenure system and to participate in the exploitation, management and 
conservation of the associated natural resources.  
</p>
<p>72.  In its observations to one State party, the Committee welcomed a draft law on the 
consultation and participation of indigenous peoples which sought to guarantee that the 
free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples would be taken into account on 
infrastructure projects that might affect their rights and encouraged State parties to adopt 
specific laws in consultation with indigenous peoples through their representatives in a 
number of observations to other State parties.  
</p>
<p>73.  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted two general 
comments during 2009 which are of particular relevance for advancing the rights of 
indigenous peoples. In its general comment No. 20 on non-discrimination in the enjoyment 
of economic, social and cultural rights, the Committee recalled that it has consistently 
raised concern over formal and substantive discrimination across a wide range of Covenant 
rights against indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities among others. It urged State parties 
to take concrete and targeted measures to eliminate discrimination and further called upon 
State parties to ensure that individuals and groups of individuals, who may be distinguished 
by one or more of the prohibited grounds, should be ensured the right to participate in 
decision-making processes over the selection of such measures. States parties should 
regularly assess whether the measures chosen are effective in practice. 
</p>
<p>74.  The Committee further referred to the provisions of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples in its general comment No. 21 on the right of everyone to take part in 
cultural life. It urged States parties to take measures to guarantee that the exercise of the 
right to take part in cultural life takes due account of the values of cultural life, which may 
be strongly communal or which can only be expressed and enjoyed as a community by 
indigenous peoples. The Committee clarified that the strong communal dimension of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural life is indispensable to their existence, well-being and full 
development, and includes the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have 
traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired. Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural 
values and rights associated with their ancestral lands and their relationship with nature 
should be regarded with respect and protected, in order to prevent the degradation of their </p>


<p>particular way of life, including their means of subsistence, the loss of their natural 
resources and, ultimately, their cultural identity. 
</p>
<p>75.  The general comment also underlines that States parties must take measures to 
recognize and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use 
their communal lands, territories and resources, and, where they have been otherwise 
inhabited or used without their free and informed consent, take steps to return these lands 
and territories. Indigenous peoples have the right to act collectively to ensure respect for 
their right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional 
knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their 
sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, 
medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literature, 
designs, sports and traditional games, and visual and performing arts. 
</p>
<p>76.  The Committee further clarified that States parties should respect the principle of 
free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples in all matters covered by their 
specific rights. In particular, States parties should obtain their free and informed prior 
consent when the preservation of their cultural resources, especially those associated with 
their way of life and cultural expression, are at risk. 
</p>
<p>77.  In its consideration of reports by State parties, the Committee expressed concerns 
about the adverse effects of the exploitation of natural resources, particularly mining 
operations and oil exploration in indigenous territories, which were carried out in violation 
of the rights of indigenous peoples with regard to their ancestral lands and natural resources 
and recommended to State parties concerned to protect the cultural identity and ancestral 
lands of the indigenous peoples affected and ensure that forest concessions do not deprive 
indigenous peoples of their enjoyment of their economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>78.  The Committee further deplored the persisting inequalities and social injustice faced 
by indigenous peoples in a number of countries, in particular in accessing employment and 
education and recommended that State parties concerned take specific measures to protect 
the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>79.  Based on its review of State parties&#8217; reports, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child has observed that, in implementing their obligations under the Convention, many 
States parties give insufficient attention to the rights of indigenous children and to the 
promotion of their development. It subsequently adopted in 2009 a general comment No. 11 
on indigenous children and their rights under the Convention. General comment No. 12 on 
the right of the child to be heard also addresses indigenous issues. 
</p>
<p>80.  General comment No. 11 underscores the importance of the child to be registered, to 
bilingual education, to health, to the enjoyment of culture, religion ands language, and to 
participation. It highlights the need for data collection to be disaggregated to enable 
possible discrimination to be identified and urges State parties to ensure that indigenous 
children have access to culturally appropriate services in areas of health, nutrition, 
education, recreation and sports, social services, housing, sanitation and juvenile justice. 
</p>
<p>81.  The general comment also calls upon State parties to adopt special measures in order 
to guarantee the effective exercise of the rights of indigenous children. State parties are 
required to consult the indigenous community as regards legislation, policies and 
indigenous children and give them an opportunity to participate in the process on how the 
best interests of indigenous children in general can be decided in a culturally sensitive way. 
Such consultation should, to the extent possible, include meaningful participation of 
indigenous children. 
</p>
<p>82.  General comment No. 12 on the right of the child to be heard also address the rights 
of indigenous children. It calls upon State parties to make efforts to recognize the right to </p>


<p>expression of views for indigenous children and other children who do not speak the 
majority language. As regards the implementation of children&#8217;s rights in general, the 
Committee reiterated its broad understanding of children&#8217;s participation. It recalled the 
need to establish procedures not only for individual children and clearly defined groups of 
children, but also for groups of children, such as indigenous children, who are affected 
directly or indirectly by social, economic or cultural conditions of living in their society. 
The Committee also continued to address the enjoyment of rights of indigenous children as 
part of its periodic review of State party reports.  
</p>
<p>83.  During the period under review, the Human Rights Committee deplored the absence 
of recognition of the existence of indigenous peoples in a number of countries. It requested 
one State party to carry out a study regarding minorities and indigenous communities in the 
State party and adopt specific legislation and special measures to protect, preserve and 
promote their cultural heritage and traditional way of life. It also recommended that the 
State party consult indigenous communities before establishing game reserves, granting 
licences for hunting, or other projects on ancestral or disputed lands. In is observations to 
another State party, the Committee requested the State party concerned to take steps to 
ensure that the indigenous community are protected against discrimination and are provided 
with effective remedies in that regard. 
</p>
<p>84.  The Committee remained concerned about the fact that indigenous peoples are not 
sufficiently consulted in decision-making process with respect to issues affecting their 
rights in a number of countries. It recommended that the State parties concerned increase 
their efforts for an effective consultation with indigenous peoples in decision-making in all 
areas having an impact on their rights. It further recommended to one State party to 
establish an adequately resourced national indigenous representative body. 
</p>
<p>85.  With regards to land issues, the Committee encouraged State parties to ensure the 
fair and expeditious resolutions of claims concerning land and resources made by the 
indigenous peoples concerned by introducing appropriate legislation in consultation with 
indigenous peoples. It also addressed the issue of forced eviction of indigenous peoples 
from their ancestral lands for reasons having to do with control over natural resources and 
recommended to the State party concerned to provide for a legal cadastral survey of 
indigenous community property.  
</p>
<p>86.  The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
Committee against Torture also addressed the situation of indigenous peoples while 
examining periodic reports. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>87.  Issues concerning indigenous peoples were frequently raised in the context of the 
universal periodic review, including in reviews concerning Belize, Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of), Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Congo, El Salvador, Fiji, Guyana, Kenya, 
Laos People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, 
Norway, Russian Federation, , Sweden, Viet Nam and Uruguay.  
</p>
<p>88.  Recommendations concerned, inter alia, indigenous communities forcibly removed 
from their land and the need to ensure effective consultation with indigenous communities 
before granting licenses for economic exploitation. Furthermore, the need to adopt 
measures to eradicate impunity for human rights violations, particularly against indigenous 
women was highlighted in certain contexts, and a number of recommendations pointed to 
the need to strengthen efforts to implement indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in such areas as 
housing, right to food, access to education, health care and legal assistance. In a number of 
cases, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was explicitly invoked, as was </p>


<p>the need to implement the recommendations of treaty bodies and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>89.  <b>During the period under review, OHCHR further strengthened its work to 
advance the rights of indigenous peoples at the country level and increased efforts to 
clarify concepts contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. Through its fellowship programme and various activities with 
United Nations country teams, Governments and civil society, OHCHR also built 
capacity amongst indigenous communities and others involved.  
</b></p>
<p>90.  <b>Furthermore, OHCHR promoted cooperation and coordination within the 
United Nations system and between the three mandates devoted to indigenous issues: 
the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and 
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Synergies between mandates have also 
been enhanced by the fact that the present report and the reports of the Special 
Rapporteur and of the Expert Mechanism have all been submitted to the same session 
of the Human Rights Council.  
</b></p>
<p>91.  <b>In addition to the important work of the mechanisms devoted to the rights of 
indigenous peoples, human rights treaty bodies and the universal periodic review 
process has frequently highlighted gaps and recommended measures to advance the 
rights of indigenous peoples in line with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. Some proposed initiatives that are currently being considered, such as the 
proposed expansion of the mandate of the Voluntary Fund for Indigenous 
Populations, could further enhance the visibility of indigenous issues in the context of 
the Human Rights Council and treaty bodies. 
</b></p>
<p>92.  <b>The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has confirmed its place as 
the United Nations&#8217; key tool in advancing the rights of indigenous peoples, and 
support for this landmark instrument is widening. During the period under review, 
OHCHR and various human rights mechanisms have pursued a broad range of 
activities to help Member States, indigenous peoples and others concerned to make 
sure that the principles of the Declaration are reflected in laws, policies and practices.  
</b></p>
